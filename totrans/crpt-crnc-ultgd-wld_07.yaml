- en: As we have come to understand, cryptocurrencies are all digital in form so they
    all must be exchanged on a digital platform. A cryptocurrency exchange house works
    pretty much in the same manner as the stock market or the Forex market does. You
    can find professional brokers available, or you can opt to do your own trading
    online.

- en: Since all transactions, therefore, must be completed online, these exchanges
    have several roles to play. First, they need to verify the identities of all participants
    relating to each transaction. This can be done through their social media accounts,
    their email accounts, or through a user account, they may hold on their exchange.

- en: While most exchanges insist that users have verified accounts, others you will
    find are not very restrictive. It is up to you to decide which of these types
    of exchanges you will be most comfortable with. Keep in mind that those that do
    not require as much verification can conduct transactions faster but may not be
    as secure.
