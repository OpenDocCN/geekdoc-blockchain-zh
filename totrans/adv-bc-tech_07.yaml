- en: The automotive industry is built traditionally as a hierarchical model with
    a vertical flow of information. This model has proven to be an age-old technique
    and doesn’t comply with the modern-day needs of the consumer. Today’s consumer
    needs customized vehicles, cost-effective models, and more efficient systems.
    All these lead to complexity in the hierarchical model [[1](#CR1)]. Also, small
    batch sizes and faster manufacturing cycles are not economically viable. The suppliers
    too are following age-old practices and sometimes fail to deliver as per expectations.
    The vehicle recall process is of a huge difficulty in a hierarchical model and
    leads to huge losses and inconvenience to the end consumers. We must keep pivoting
    and add technological advancements to ensure that the automotive sector is well
    defined and highly efficient.

    of things (IIoT) [[3](#CR3)]. All efforts have led to the design and develop a
    revolution in the sector calling it industry 4.0 [[3](#CR3)]. With such efforts,
    all the objects are getting connected and sharing data which makes the system
    smarter and keeps the record of all the events.

    (CPS), and when applied to production systems, it is termed as cyber-physical
    production systems (CPPS) [[4](#CR4)]. Figure [1](#Fig1) showcases how physical
    components such as actuators and sensors can be connected through communication
    networks, thereby making it available for cyber-components to churn the data and
    take effective actions [[5](#CR5)]. CPPSs are a core element of industry 4.0 that
    bring huge advantages and grass root-level changes in the day-to-day operations
    of the whole supply chain [[6](#CR6)]. All the departments, including the supplier
    factories, need to undergo digitization to be effective for the CPPS. This leads
    to a new model where the hierarchical-vertical model is broken down to a decentralized-horizontal
    model [[5](#CR5)]. Every single supplier becomes an implementation of CPS and
    shares data with the principal manufacturer. There are huge advantages of such
    implementation of IIoT and CPPS.![](../images/513458_1_En_7_Chapter/513458_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png)

    and small batch sizes can be implemented easily with no losses. With blockchain-based
    CPPS in the automotive sector, tracing and tracking become highly efficient, and
    issues can be solved well before handing out to the consumer, thereby no need
    for recalls. Even if needed, every part and supplier can be traced back to give

    A blockchain can be viewed as a chain of data blocks, and each block contains
    a number of information related to what we call transactions. Every block is linked
    to the previous one by means of a pointer, which makes it difficult to alter the
    data saved into the blocks. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger, and
    each node of the distributed network holds the final version of the ledger. The
    ledger is append-only, cryptographically secure and updated only after reaching
    a consensus among nodes.

    and logistical objects that know and communicate their current status and location,
    know their target destinations within the value chain, and control the required
    production and logistics processes actively [[21](#CR21)]. Thus, the digitized

    boundaries of their factories to the whole value network involving all processes
    and partners from the engineering, sourcing, and production up to final product
    delivery. For an efficient and dynamic exchange of information within an ad-hoc
    designed value chain, network standards and reference architectures are required

    The only way out is to have a decentralized control concept and architecture for
