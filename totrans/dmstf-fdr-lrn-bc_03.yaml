- en: With the rapid development of big data technologies, their applications are
    growing rapidly. Conventional big data management is vulnerable. If any tampering
    occurs over stored database or sometimes untrusted data gathering occurs, then
    it causes serious issues with conventional data management. To resolve these problems,
    this chapter is focused on the development of blockchain technology for secure
    educational big data (EBD). Blockchain techniques divide the data blocks into
    secure data blocks using cryptography algorithms. The secure data blocks are connected
    in the chain with each other. This ensures security as well as flexibility. So,
    in this chapter, the proposed methodology had adopted blockchain technology and
    ensures its efficiency due to its decentralized and flexible approach.

- en: Growing demand and Internet development for things and big data encourage a
    scientific measurement concept and discovery. Big data is a collection of strategies
    that could assist with the continuous assessment and transformation of the higher
    education system to meet the rapid speed of evolving developments in various sectors
    of the economy, which in turn generates a range of employee skills. Technology
    is an essential component that has radically altered how education is delivered.
    For example, mobile equipment, remote access systems and conference calling, academic
    platforms and services, etc. Teachers, students, academics evaluation experts,
    decision-makers interact, and researchers, including different types of technology
    used in education. These are aimed at affecting and enhancing learning and teaching
    and reflecting the use of modern technologies in real learning environments realistically.
    Large quantities of data are created through contact with these technologies,
    ranging from a single access log file to institutional-level operations. Educational
    systems, however, are not yet fully prepared to address them and use them to improve
    their continued quality (Qin, 2015). It is more pressing than ever that challenges
    be regulated within the education system. During the duration of the investigation
    and use of knowledge discovery, various options such as big data and analytics
    were indeed considered.

    sets, Big Data (Bedi et al 2021) is now commonly used. In many sectors, it is
    found. There is constant receipt of large volumes of data from diverse sources
    and in different formats generated by the public, corporate, and social sectors.
    In certain situations, the information is exceptionally massive, such as petabytes
    that surpass the warehouse's structural or material capital, are handled and processed
    and are thus referred to as deep learning. Sector by sector or, in general, within
    the same sector, department by department (Qin, 2015). Because of its attribute
    of becoming huge, big data is referred to as such. Big data is therefore distinguished
    by additional features, including the various forms and ways and the distinct
    information streams, and the pace at which they are generated and, quite significantly,
    either by the intensity at which it is gathered. They are commonly extracted or
    often handled in actuality. They all have volume (size) and a wide range (sources,
    ways, and types) as well as pace (speed and frequency), illustrating and presenting
    challenges to data that would be another issue (Xuejuan, 2015).

    system or domain is called big data, irrespective of whether all three of such
    features may be deemed 'tiny' for the text field. The data can vary between megabytes
    and petabytes, depending on the domain. Therefore, large data is context-specific
    and could refer to different types and sizes from one domain to the next. This
    is sufficient throughout this situation to question the limitations on how the
    information could be interpreted and evaluated so that it could be used only for
    multiple purposes. However, interpreting the data by analyzing it at a higher
    predictive rate and facilitating the development of data-driven systems and practices
    is the challenge common to all these areas (Abu et al., 2019).

    situations, thus providing an immensely helpful strategy in their possible impact
    on education, analysis methods in the area of business intelligence and analysis
    (Toivonen et al., 2019), or the field of professional data mining technologies
    (Miah et al., 2020). Due to the small analysis towards the use of Big Data and
    analysis in educational standards, we are looking to launch the user to the different
    territory of Big Data in academia where Data Analysis is integrated into technology,
    and also how information curriculum could be presented to different teams, such
    as politicians, assessment specialists, faculty, in different aspects and perspectives.

    Massive volumes of educational data are gathered and generated daily in the higher
    learning environment from various sources and formats. Education data ranges from
    what comes through its use and engagement with learning analytics and networks
    by learners to active learning and course information that involves a curriculum
    such as learning materials, learning goals, test outcomes, activities, and a separate
    category of data related to processes and procedures for administrative, instructional,
    and quality improvement (Li, 2020).

    Systems are implemented adequately for higher education research and development
    are the program and its materials, as a major component of Global Academic Data
    (Li, 2020). In the context of teaching and learning, the restricted use of big
    data in academic achievement, as well as the scale and scope of such data, implies
    that particular strategies need to be applied to discover the valuable new information
    that is currently concealed in the data (Zhang et al., 2020). Such approaches
    could be extracted and modified from several other fields that are dominated by
    data analytics and used effectively to exploit big data in the curriculum. These
    methods will be used to allow us to experience student academic achievement strategies,
    and also, It can be dramatically influenced by explaining areas of large education
    data, such as children's real skills based on the curriculum taught (Yu et al.,
    2019). Together, Data technology has shown the ability to facilitate different
    higher education activities at this time. These activities include “administrative
    decision-making and institutional distribution of resources,” preventing individuals
    at risk through failing to recognize them early, developing successful teaching
    strategies, and transforming the conventional view of the program to rethink it
    as a pattern of interactions and links between various data individuals collected
    and frequently generated from LMS.

    used in the registry of Bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions as a peer-to-peer
    ledger (Memon et al., 2019). The goal is to eliminate any third-party agents and
    to encourage people to monitor their financial affairs. Cryptocurrency has been
    established as a distributed network of peer nodes. The transaction replica in
    each of the nodes on the Network is provided by (1) the entrance in its booklet
    is written when it is supported from either device in the System, (2) the activity
    by its users is simulcast to several other nodes within the Network, and (3) the
    booklet is verified regularly to be the same as the booklet held on the Network.
    Researchers and practitioners are realizing the enormous significance of its underlying
    technology as Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity (Gatteschi et al., 2018).
    In cryptocurrencies, as well as in many other fields, Block chain's unique capacity,
    including immutability, transparency, and confidence, is useful. The number of
    cryptocurrency technologies has, however, become built-in in different fields
    (Chen et al., 2018), (Nwosu et. al 2021).

    may be broken into three key phases: 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\. It was used to promote
    cryptocurrency and basic cash trading. Block-chain 1\. Blockchain 2.0 for properties
    and intelligent contracts was then introduced. Such intelligent agreements impose
    additional requirements and criteria which must be met before they can be registered
    within the Blockchain. Registration occurs without a third party''s intervention.
    Several applications in different sectors, such as education, health, and science,
    the government, were developed in Blockchain 3.0\. Blockchain persists in the
    primary level of education. Only a smaller number of education institutions used
    blockchain technology. It is used by most of these organizations to justify and
    exchange educational credentials and/or learning results attained by their students
    (Chen et al., 2018). Field experts suggest that cryptocurrency technology can
    bring much more and greatly improve the ground. Nespor (2018) reports that cryptocurrency
    could weaken schools'' central position as certifying officers and provide students
    with more educational experiences. While the volume of literature on the application
    of Blockchain to education has increased in recent years, it is still fragmented,
    and no systematic review on the subject has yet been carried out. This analysis
    is of considerable value to include a state-of-the-art overview and advice-proof
    practice. This article, however, contributes in an actual and reasonable manner
    to the research of teaching methods by examining the use of cryptocurrency technologies
    in schools. The main target audience of these companies is managers, policymakers,
    academics, and researchers who want to secure knowledge of this emerging technology

    and relevant system architectures and intelligent systems are discussed. However,
    in the education blockchain, difficult to experiment and optimize need to be further
    solved, and problems of difficult to model, and further research is required for
    driving mechanisms, application scenarios, and other issues. Gong et al. (2019)
    presented an overview of education blockchain, including problems and concerns,
    before incorporating a parallel analytical approach and blockchain technology.
    The author also suggested blockchain parallel education and its guided process,
    delivery of functions, application scenarios, data transfer, and related issues;
    Eventually, many questions are posed for debate. Naumova et al. (2019) described
    the major attributes of Blockchain emerging technologies, which have produced
    many valuable responses among professional and academic groups. The prospects
    for evaluating the possibility of its successful application in other areas were
    evident following its success in the financial market, where the block chained
    contains iced blocks the chain which describes all transactions with virtual coins,
    like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and others. Since education in Russia is undergoing
    a duration of initiatives, the possibilities and issues of implementation in this
    sphere are given special attention. The article explores the feasibility of implementing
    blockchain technology in the field of education for distributed registries and
    mass applications. And the probability that the teaching material can be improved
    is also assessed. Liu et al. (2019) used the blockchain system's openness and
    – anti properties to achieve a collaborative system for education and industry
    based on the Hyperledger blockchain framework. The System replicates the positions
    of universities and businesses in the System using the Certificate Authority service
    and transactions in the Hyperledger network. It allows institutions and businesses
    to access ideas in a clear manner that achieves information symmetry between participant
    knowledge and skills information business selection requirements, and competitive
    analysis. The above represents a tremendous endeavor to apply blockchain technology
    as a pilot for new technologies in academic achievement and industrial cooperation.
