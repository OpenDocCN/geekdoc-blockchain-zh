  zh: 摘要
- en: The convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain is growing very fast
    in everyday applications and industry. In centralized systems and applications
    like healthcare, data access and processing in real-time among various information
    systems is a bottleneck. Blockchain’s decentralized database architecture, secure
    storage, authentication, and data sharing would offer a solution to this problem.
    Besides, Artificial Intelligence can live at the top of Blockchain and generate
    insights from the generated shared data used to make predictions. Blockchain is
    a high-level cybersecurity technology that forms chains that connect the existing
    blocks stored in nodes and the new block chronologically by mutual agreements
    between nodes. Technology convergence accelerates various industries’ growth,
    such as banking, insurance, cybersecurity, forecasting, medical services, cryptocurrency,
    etc… The more digital systems are adopted and services provided by these industries,
    the greater the risk of hacking these systems. Combining blockchain power and
    artificial intelligence can provide a strong shield against these attacks and
    security threats. In this chapter, we will study the convergence of AI and Blockchain
    in cybersecurity. We will expand on their role in securing cyber-physical systems.

  zh: 1 引言
- en: The world we live in today is highly revolutionized, whereby we have to depend
    on technology to move forward. Unlike a decade ago, everything is interconnected.
    When discussing history, we talk about the industrial revolutions that changed
    the face of the industrial world. There was a time that technology was so minimal
    that there barely any planning was needed for it. For example, look at how the
    telephone started. Once it was invented, it was only available to the very elite,
    which means they could only speak amongst themselves. Fast forward to the invention
    of the computer. The machines were so big they could barely be transported. Today,
    we have very sleek computers that are desktops and even laptops, which are very
    portable.

  zh: 我们今天生活的世界已经高度革命化，我们必须依靠技术来前进。不像十年前，一切都是相互关联的。当讨论历史时，我们谈论改变工业世界面貌的工业革命。曾经有一段时间，技术非常有限，几乎不需要为它进行任何规划。例如，看看电话是如何开始的。一旦发明出来，它只能供非常精英的人使用，这意味着他们只能在自己人之间交谈。快进到计算机的发明。这些机器非常大，几乎无法运输。如今，我们有非常精致的台式机甚至是便携式笔记本电脑，非常便携。
- en: On the other hand, old telephones have evolved so much that now we have foldable
    mobile phones. The globe has turned into a village with all the technological
    advancements that have been made, and now it is easy to communicate with anyone
    as long as they are in a place where they can access the Internet. The advancements
    have not been solely within the phone and computer sectors, neither. In the era
    we live in, our existence’s whole dynamic has changed [[1](#CR1)]. We have machines
    in place to do almost every chore the human being can take up. Companies have
    turned into a digital era in which machines can now carry out some workers’ duties,
    which means the workers are becoming very expandable. Before the emergence of
    HTML, WWW, among other things within the Internet, computers and their connectivity
    were very much limited and on a local basis.

  zh: 另一方面，旧电话已经发展到了可以折叠的移动电话。由于所有已经取得的技术进步，地球已经变成了一个村庄，现在只要他们能够接入互联网，与任何人交流都很容易。进步不仅仅局限于电话和电脑领域。在我们生活的时代，我们整个存在的动态都发生了变化[[1](#CR1)]。我们已经有了几乎可以执行人类几乎所有家务的机器。公司已经进入了数字时代，其中机器现在可以执行一些工人的职责，这意味着工人变得非常可替代。在互联网出现HTML、WWW等东西之前，计算机及其连接性非常有限，并且局限于本地基础。
- en: Another significant advancement within the Internet and technology is the Internet
    of Things (IoT)/Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While technology has significantly
    advanced, devices have also been on the increase. That is why most companies have
    taken up establishing their devices to be connected with other devices. We live
    in a world where all devices we own can be interconnected so they can, in a way,
    communicate among themselves. This is meant to increase the accessibility of the
    devices, as well as connectivity. With devices such as Alexa, which can even communicate
    with us, is a significant change and development in the technology world. The
    beginning was how mobile phones could be connected to laptops that we had, but
    now, most electronic devices we own at home can interconnect [[2](#CR2)]. Using
    a more comprehensive look at the developments is very welcomed and will help bring
    many advancements to how people live. Having a fridge whereby, due to interconnectivity,
    it can identify what is depleting and needs to be bought, among other things,
    is a considerable advancement. Every aspect of our lives is filled with technology
    and its advances. Think of vehicles; some, like the Tesla, is driverless, meaning
    they can interconnect with our phones, among other technologies.

  zh: 另一个在互联网和技术领域的重大进步是物联网（IoT）/网络物理系统（CPS）。虽然技术取得了显著进步，但设备数量也在增加。这就是为什么大多数公司开始建立他们的设备与其他设备连接起来。我们生活在一个我们拥有的所有设备都可以互相连接的世界，以便它们在某种程度上可以相互通信。这旨在提高设备的可访问性和连接性。像Alexa这样的设备甚至可以与我们交流，这是技术世界的一项重大变革和发展。最初是移动电话可以连接到我们拥有的笔记本电脑，但现在，我们在家里拥有的大多数电子设备都可以互连[[2](#CR2)]。欢迎对这些发展进行更全面的审视，这将有助于带来许多人们生活的进步。例如，有一台冰箱，由于互连性，它可以识别出什么东西正在减少并需要购买，等等，这是一项重大进步。我们生活的每个方面都充满了技术及其进步。想想车辆；一些车辆，像特斯拉，是无人驾驶的，这意味着它们可以与我们的手机等其他技术进行互联。
- en: While we can have the interconnectivity of devices, the different technological
    devices existing individually makes it simple for them to be accessed by outsiders
    if the right security steps are not taken. Cybersecurity comes hand in hand with
    every development that is made within technology. Cybersecurity refers to protecting
    and defending computers, electronics, and their technological devices from external
    attacks. The data and information stored within the devices are essential, making
    them vulnerable to malicious attacks if not well protected. While the technology
    gurus continue advancing their innovations, the cybersecurity threats metastasize.
    That is why cybersecurity has to move in sync with every advancement that is made.
    In technology, most advancements include updates on devices already in existence,
    which can cause the cracks that the threats are waiting to take advantage of if
    not well overwritten and covered. Therefore, as much importance that we give to
    the developments, we should give the same or more attention to the cybersecurity
    sector. We need advancements connected to existing or new technology every day,
    but they all deal with data and access some aspects that require privacy. Simultaneously,
    almost every sector starting from the companies we work for, the banking system,
    and even the health sector, uses advanced technology. They require data, and if
    it falls into the wrong hands, it can cause so much harm to people. That is why
    cybersecurity is necessary for every aspect that has any connection to using any
    technology within their running.

  zh: 尽管我们可以实现设备之间的互联性，但是如果不采取正确的安全措施，不同的技术设备独立存在，很容易被外部人员访问。网络安全与技术发展紧密相连。 网络安全是指保护和捍卫计算机、电子设备及其技术设备免受外部攻击。
    存储在设备中的数据和信息至关重要，如果没有得到很好的保护，就会容易受到恶意攻击。 尽管技术专家继续推动他们的创新，网络安全威胁却在蔓延。 这就是为什么网络安全必须与技术的每一项进步同步进行。
    在技术领域，大多数进步都包括对已存在的设备进行更新，如果不加以很好的覆盖和保护，就会造成威胁等待利用的裂缝。 因此，尽管我们给予发展多少重视，我们也应该给予同样或更多的关注网络安全领域。
    我们每天都需要与现有或新技术相关的进步，但它们都涉及数据和访问一些需要隐私的方面。 同时，几乎每个行业，从我们工作的公司、银行系统，甚至健康领域，都在使用先进技术。
    它们需要数据，如果数据落入错误的手中，将会给人们造成很大的伤害。 这就是为什么对于任何与其运作中使用任何技术相关的方面来说，网络安全都是必要的。

    as a horizontal technology that is commonly used in different areas [[3](#CR3)–[5](#CR5)].
    The need for a central authority to monitor and validate communications and transfers
    between many participants can be highly economically removed by Blockchain. Each
    transaction in Blockchain shall be secured and checked by all mining nodes comprising
    a duplicate of the entire ledger containing chains across all transactions. This

    enables a device to understand, conclude, and adjust cognitive capacities based
    on data it gathers. According to recent market reports (Economics of Artificial
    Intelligence), AI is projected to rise by 2030 to $13 trillion [[8](#CR8)]. Artificial
    Intelligence has evolved due to large-scale development and knowledge generation
    through sensing systems, IoT devices, social media, and web applications. Various
    machine learning techniques can use such data. The majority of AI’s machine learning
    techniques depend on a centralized training model using clusters or cloud services
    provided by companies such as Google, Amazon, Oracle …etc. [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)].
    A point to keep in mind that the sensed data is error and security prone. Blockchain
    decentralized architecture, security, and authenticity can be of great support
    to AI. Intelligent Algorithms run on shared data but are secured, trusted, and
    authentic [[11](#CR11)]. Blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence techniques use

    identify how best to respond and what security measures to apply. First, we have
    *cyber terrorism*, which is on broader coverage. It aims to cause panic and fear
    of technology in the masses. It is used by radicals who are against the idea of
    technological developments. They rely on panic and fear to disrupt the running
    of society. We have *cyber-attacks* mainly aimed at attacks on political grounds
    to share information that is not meant for the public. Lastly, we have *cyber-crime*,
    which is driven by financial gain and disruptions, which affects the various systems.
    There are already existing cyber threats, but as technology increases and advances,

    the attacker befriends or uses the person to override the security measures to
    protect information [[18](#CR18)]. In such cases, the person who falls victim
    is left to bear the effects of the attack. Such attacks take planning, as most

    emails, and they use them to gather the information they are aiming to acquire.
    The emails sent resemble emails from reliable sources used as a dangling carrot
    for the victims. *Ransomware* is given the name due to the ransom asked for once
    the attacker controls the information or system files. Ransomware involves the
    feeding of malware into the computer system. *Malware* involves introducing malicious
    software, which causes harm to the system file or grants access to the information
    within the system files. Cybercriminals use a structured language query to insert
    malicious ware or viruses to gain access to the information. SQL submits a malicious
    SQL statement, which gives criminals access to the database being targeted. There

    Dridex malware attack by the United States Department of Justice [[19](#CR19)].
    The government, the public, and infrastructure worldwide were affected by the
    malware. The thing about malware and the state of connectivity that we have today
    is that attackers can simultaneously affect many users. Currently, there is a
    surge in zero-days, which are threats that emerge and do not carry any detectable
    digital signatures [[20](#CR20)]. When attacks happen, the experts rely highly
    on the digital signature the hacker left to triangulate and gather information
    about them to get to the hacker. With a threat that has no detectable digital
    signature, it means it is hard to protect from. Notably, when dealing with cyber
    threats and enhancing cybersecurity, they triangulate and check the vulnerabilities
    the hacker used in cases of existing threats. The use of digital signatures sheds
    light on how the hackers got access to the network or system files. Within the
    information, they can now work on preventing such attacks by eradicating the vulnerabilities
    and upping the systems’ security. Cyber-attacks can come from hackers or even
    people looking to hurt the organization. It can be even those that we do not and
    could never suspect. That is why the issue becomes critical because, in such cases,
    they know the security protocols and applications in place. That is which security
    put in place should be very legitimate and strong to avoid such attacks. Unfortunately,
    for every safety measure, there is an override put in place for risk management.

- en: Even then, the network DDoS attacks have declined since then, but that does
    not mean that they are not an issue to grapple with. Trends show that when there
    is a new vulnerability, the attacks increase for a time before they are mitigated,
    which leads them to slow down. Figure [1](#Fig1) below shows the trends of the
    DDoS attacks 2017–2018\. The Y-axis represents the attack size, while the darker
    the dots get, the more prevalent the attacks on that size. From 2017 to 2018 in
    January, there was an increase in attacks by density from 560 to 738 Mbps. That
    shows a tremendous increase in the attacks, and the move now is ensuring that
    we can give out workable security measures before the attacks. The attacks spur
    for a moment until they are discovered and then solved, but then the damage has
    already been done. Although it can be challenging, having measures in place that
    prevent attacks at all and risk management can help network security. The more
    the attacker stays within the network undetected, the more information they gather
    and the better chance of destroying the enterprise. They get to learn the company’s
    trends and can cause damages slowly because they do not arouse suspicion, and
    by the time they are done, they have done so much it is impossible to regain the
    previous state of the network. That is why cybersecurity should be applied before
    the attacks.![../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png)

    2017 年至 2018 年 DDoS 攻击的趋势。Y 轴表示攻击大小，颜色越深的点表示在该大小上攻击的频率越高。从 2017 年到 2018 年 1 月，攻击密度从
    560 Mbps 增加到 738 Mbps。这显示了攻击的巨大增加，现在的做法是在攻击发生之前确保我们能提供可行的安全措施。攻击会在一段时间内加剧，直到被发现并解决，但此时损害已经造成。尽管这可能是具有挑战性的，但采取防止攻击和风险管理措施可以帮助网络安全。攻击者在网络内未被发现的时间越长，他们获得的信息越多，摧毁企业的机会就越大。他们了解公司的趋势，并且可以缓慢地造成损害，因为他们不会引起怀疑，等到完成时，他们已经做了很多事情，恢复网络到先前状态是不可能的。这就是为什么应该在攻击之前应用网络安全的原因。![../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png)

    the use of statistics and machine learning. With artificial intelligence, it is
    possible to identify the vulnerabilities before the black hackers. If not, the
    machine and statistics learning will immediately recognize a new entry into the

    the vulnerabilities. The access of new users or unauthorized users can be hard
    as the systems get new users, especially in platforms like websites and social
    media platforms. This system will detect any behavioural abnormality within the
    systems and even track the event sequences. With such systems, it becomes easier

- en: Unfortunately, cybercriminals have turned cybercrime into business opportunities.
    Professional black hackers are selling the tools they use, especially for zero-day
    attacks, to other people within the black markets. With so many people having
    access to such tools, they can cause many problems within the systems and cyberspace.
    Over time, people have taken up the use of mobile phones in almost everything.
    Now, every aspect of our lives has an application that we can use to communicate
    with, such as within the bank’s systems, interactions at work, etc. [[31](#CR31)].
    Add this to how affordable mobile phones have become, as everyone is now using
    them. It becomes effortless for hackers to access the mobile phone systems and
    manipulate them to their liking. In such matters, the systems have to use extreme
    measures like voice and facial recognition to increase security.

- en: We have proficient use of the Internet of Things around the globe. We have made
    quite some progress towards technological development. Today, the most growing
    part is the Internet of Things, whereby all devices are interconnected to help
    increase management and control. While this is great for individuals, accessing
    and controlling all your devices from just one place is also beneficial to hackers.
    With their prowess in attacking the systems, now they can do it by accessing the
    one device with control over the rest of the device within a person’s life. We
    cannot eradicate such a challenge as there has to progress in cyberspace and technology
    [[32](#CR32)]. We have to come up with more robust and more effective cybersecurity
    techniques and strategies so that the end consumers can enjoy the technological
    advancements. Estimates show in the next ten years, the number of devices that
    will be under the connectivity of the Internet of things will be around 125 billion.
    Therefore, the challenge will continue [[27](#CR27)]. As discussed, cybersecurity
    issues are continuous and never stop evolving. What changes is how they handle
    it, which is why the techniques to deal with the attacks and the rest should also
    keep changing and updating to better and more reliable versions. Another challenge
    is at the time, and the hackers administer their attacks by attacking third-party
    vendors. That is people who are not under the wing of the company. For instance,
    within a company, they can treat a person who does delivery to that company. Prevention
    of such breaches can be hard to manage as the most secured areas are the company’s

    是全球金融部门对攻击的响应时间的一个示例。攻击成功的时间跨度包括攻击发起和成功的时间，而发现成功则是意识到系统被入侵的时间[[33](#CR33)]。最后，入侵被发现后的时间，而处理和控制它的时间则是恢复时间。从下面的数据可以看出，攻击时间非常迅速，几乎是在几秒钟内完成的。但是，发现入侵需要一些时间，尤其是在没有触发警报的情况下，确定或检测系统内的入侵是多么的缓慢。在入侵发生后清理混乱需要很长时间，公司可能已经失去了声誉和客户，以及被窃取的信息或数据[[41](#CR41)]。![../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png)

    quickly, and its use is no longer limited to digital currencies. A Blockchain
    is a distributed public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions.
    The distributed ledger records the transactions of Blockchain blocks, and every
    block is related with a hash function to preserve the chain with its previous
    block [[14](#CR14)]. The network elements/nodes will receive a pair of the public
    key and private key upon registering to the network. Public key works as a unique
    identifier for each element. Private key also helps to sign transactions in the
    network and is used for encryption and decryption. The transactions are received
    by all the nodes and are validated. They are grouped into a timestamped block
    by few nodes designated as miners [[14](#CR14)]. Blockchain is a “*No Central
    Authority*,” consensus algorithm used to select a block, among the number of blocks
    created by the miners, added to the Blockchain network. For making any changes
    to the existing block of data, all the nodes present in the network run algorithms
    to evaluate, verify, and match the transaction information with Blockchain history.
    If the majority of the nodes agree in favor of the transaction, then it is approved,
    and a new block gets added to the existing chain.

    data set. We have some objective we have something that we want the AI to do in
    this case, classify an object (say a pine tree) as a pine tree or is it not a
    pine tree, so what we do is we feed this AI a training set of images of different
    types of trees. Hence, the idea is that the AI learns the mapping the relationship
    between the input data and output data (labels). The idea is that the Human would
    have to extract all the features of what it means to be a pine tree; the shape
    of a tree, the leaves, the length of the stem …etc. This was a very tiring process,
    but this is what humans by hand, and so what happened is once we’ve extracted
    those features, we would feed it to some kind of machine learning model. There’s
    a lot out there; eventually, it would learn the mapping and then give it a new
    tree picture, and it would know this is a pine. In recent years, a neural network
    which is machine learning model, we feed it with the dataset and massive computing
    power and add a lot of layers deep layers aka deep learning that’s what we call

    said every single miner has to prove that they have solved some random mathematical
    problem; it’s called the proof of work algorithm (PoW) [[16](#CR16)], and that
    means that you have to have more computing power than the fastest supercomputers
    in the world combined with having the majority of the computing power in the Bitcoin
    network. Because no one has that much computing power, no one’s been able to hack
    Bitcoin, and that’s why it has over 350 billion market cap as of this writing

    Nakamoto 说每个矿工都必须证明他们已经解决了一些随机的数学问题；这就是所谓的工作证明算法（PoW）[[16](#CR16)]，这意味着你必须拥有比世界上最快的超级计算机还要多的计算能力，并且拥有比特币网络中大多数的计算能力。因为没有人拥有那么多的计算能力，所以没有人能够黑掉比特币，这就是为什么它在本文撰写时市值超过

    not mix. The unique structure of Blockchain, the immutable and unalterable data
    structure, and the proof of work algorithm make the blockchains deterministic.
    At any given time, we know exactly what is happening, and they are unchangeable.
    Artificial Intelligence is based on prediction and probability models. What we
    can do is to combine Blockchain and AI together. We can use this immutable ledger
    and have an AI speak to the Blockchain, and data is being pointed to some kind
    of decentralized storage source. Let us imagine that we can allow AI to live on
    the Blockchain that means it has full access to the power of immutable decentralized
    architecture and a very secure signature. If AI lives there and no human intermediary
    is available, we are giving the AI the full power to learn, adapt, and expand
    and then gain control! (scary right?) Knowing the PoW algorithm and the need for
    supercomputers to hack and attack, it is not easy to shut down such a huge monster
    trying to get control. This convergence of AI and Blockchain needs to be normalized
    and regulated so that we can keep control. Recently, a model called *SecNet,*
    which incorporates Blockchain technologies and AI to provide protections for the
    whole system, has been proposed in [[42](#CR42)]. This architecture guarantees
    that the safety and protection of data exchanged by the various system members
    are maintained. The authors also carried out a security review of the architecture,
    which resisted a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) threat.

    That is why, because the organizations have to develop techniques to prevent cyber-attacks,
    it is essential we also play our parts. The unpredictability of cyber-attacks
    as technology advances means they are always running and open for discoveries.
    Therefore, younger generations should be encouraged to engage in cyber-related
    professions to have better control over the issue. Research has shown that there
    is little understanding of the dynamics of information technology, which includes
    cybersecurity. Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain are born out of human behaviors
    that have worked in the past, prediction, responsiveness, and validation, making
    them two of the most promising security measures for the near future. Potential
    Applications in Information Security may allow Blockchains to manage digital identities,
    protect large amounts of data, and secure edge devices. A few critical elements
    make Blockchain one of the most secure suppliers of cyber defense. It is capable
    of supplying protection for financial activities such as cryptocurrency transactions.
    Some of the characteristics that make Blockchain very secure are decentralization,
    immutability, and accountability. Blockchain implements numerous cryptographic
    protocols, most of which are difficult to decipher. The integration of Blockchain
    and AI technologies can empower AI by providing a secure and trustful environment.
