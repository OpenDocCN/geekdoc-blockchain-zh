- en: The convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain is growing very fast
    in everyday applications and industry. In centralized systems and applications
    like healthcare, data access and processing in real-time among various information
    systems is a bottleneck. Blockchain’s decentralized database architecture, secure
    storage, authentication, and data sharing would offer a solution to this problem.
    Besides, Artificial Intelligence can live at the top of Blockchain and generate
    insights from the generated shared data used to make predictions. Blockchain is
    a high-level cybersecurity technology that forms chains that connect the existing
    blocks stored in nodes and the new block chronologically by mutual agreements
    between nodes. Technology convergence accelerates various industries’ growth,
    such as banking, insurance, cybersecurity, forecasting, medical services, cryptocurrency,
    etc… The more digital systems are adopted and services provided by these industries,
    the greater the risk of hacking these systems. Combining blockchain power and
    artificial intelligence can provide a strong shield against these attacks and
    security threats. In this chapter, we will study the convergence of AI and Blockchain
    in cybersecurity. We will expand on their role in securing cyber-physical systems.

    on technology to move forward. Unlike a decade ago, everything is interconnected.
    When discussing history, we talk about the industrial revolutions that changed
    the face of the industrial world. There was a time that technology was so minimal
    that there barely any planning was needed for it. For example, look at how the
    telephone started. Once it was invented, it was only available to the very elite,
    which means they could only speak amongst themselves. Fast forward to the invention
    of the computer. The machines were so big they could barely be transported. Today,
    we have very sleek computers that are desktops and even laptops, which are very
    portable.

    mobile phones. The globe has turned into a village with all the technological
    advancements that have been made, and now it is easy to communicate with anyone
    as long as they are in a place where they can access the Internet. The advancements
    have not been solely within the phone and computer sectors, neither. In the era
    we live in, our existence’s whole dynamic has changed [[1](#CR1)]. We have machines
    in place to do almost every chore the human being can take up. Companies have
    turned into a digital era in which machines can now carry out some workers’ duties,
    which means the workers are becoming very expandable. Before the emergence of
    HTML, WWW, among other things within the Internet, computers and their connectivity
    were very much limited and on a local basis.

    of Things (IoT)/Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While technology has significantly
    advanced, devices have also been on the increase. That is why most companies have
    taken up establishing their devices to be connected with other devices. We live
    in a world where all devices we own can be interconnected so they can, in a way,
    communicate among themselves. This is meant to increase the accessibility of the
    devices, as well as connectivity. With devices such as Alexa, which can even communicate
    with us, is a significant change and development in the technology world. The
    beginning was how mobile phones could be connected to laptops that we had, but
    now, most electronic devices we own at home can interconnect [[2](#CR2)]. Using
    a more comprehensive look at the developments is very welcomed and will help bring
    many advancements to how people live. Having a fridge whereby, due to interconnectivity,
    it can identify what is depleting and needs to be bought, among other things,
    is a considerable advancement. Every aspect of our lives is filled with technology
    and its advances. Think of vehicles; some, like the Tesla, is driverless, meaning
    they can interconnect with our phones, among other technologies.

    devices existing individually makes it simple for them to be accessed by outsiders
    if the right security steps are not taken. Cybersecurity comes hand in hand with
    every development that is made within technology. Cybersecurity refers to protecting
    and defending computers, electronics, and their technological devices from external
    attacks. The data and information stored within the devices are essential, making
    them vulnerable to malicious attacks if not well protected. While the technology
    gurus continue advancing their innovations, the cybersecurity threats metastasize.
    That is why cybersecurity has to move in sync with every advancement that is made.
    In technology, most advancements include updates on devices already in existence,
    which can cause the cracks that the threats are waiting to take advantage of if
    not well overwritten and covered. Therefore, as much importance that we give to
    the developments, we should give the same or more attention to the cybersecurity
    sector. We need advancements connected to existing or new technology every day,
    but they all deal with data and access some aspects that require privacy. Simultaneously,
    almost every sector starting from the companies we work for, the banking system,
    and even the health sector, uses advanced technology. They require data, and if
    it falls into the wrong hands, it can cause so much harm to people. That is why
    cybersecurity is necessary for every aspect that has any connection to using any
    technology within their running.

    as a horizontal technology that is commonly used in different areas [[3](#CR3)–[5](#CR5)].
    The need for a central authority to monitor and validate communications and transfers
    between many participants can be highly economically removed by Blockchain. Each
    transaction in Blockchain shall be secured and checked by all mining nodes comprising
    a duplicate of the entire ledger containing chains across all transactions. This
    offers stable and coordinated information that cannot be manipulated and exchanged

    enables a device to understand, conclude, and adjust cognitive capacities based
    on data it gathers. According to recent market reports (Economics of Artificial
    Intelligence), AI is projected to rise by 2030 to $13 trillion [[8](#CR8)]. Artificial
    Intelligence has evolved due to large-scale development and knowledge generation
    through sensing systems, IoT devices, social media, and web applications. Various
    machine learning techniques can use such data. The majority of AI’s machine learning
    techniques depend on a centralized training model using clusters or cloud services
    provided by companies such as Google, Amazon, Oracle …etc. [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)].
    A point to keep in mind that the sensed data is error and security prone. Blockchain
    decentralized architecture, security, and authenticity can be of great support
    to AI. Intelligent Algorithms run on shared data but are secured, trusted, and
    authentic [[11](#CR11)]. Blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence techniques use
    decentralized learning to help ensure the trust and exchange of information and
    decision-making by many agents who can participate, collaborate on making decisions

- en: Over time, there has been much advancement in technology; thus, people have
    several research on cybersecurity to understand it better and even give a breakdown
    of how the issue can be rectified. We are moving to an era where technology, and
    then the Internet, will be in every aspect of our lives if it already is not.
    For example, take a quick look at social media platforms where nowadays, everyone
    spends their time. That is why, among other sectors, it is the area that manages
    to bring people together and contains so much data, some of which is private and
    can be used to commit a crime if it falls into the wrong hands. To better understand
    cybersecurity and its application, we have to have a clear comprehension of the
    threats that exist; the only way that we can manage to control and prevent a problem
    is by first understanding how it works. We also need to understand the vulnerable
    areas whereby we can come up with the most suitable actions. Cyber threats are
    also driven by various reasons and knowing them gives us an advantage as we can
    work towards the crime’s intentions to ensure prevention via security measures.

    identify how best to respond and what security measures to apply. First, we have
    *cyber terrorism*, which is on broader coverage. It aims to cause panic and fear
    of technology in the masses. It is used by radicals who are against the idea of
    technological developments. They rely on panic and fear to disrupt the running
    of society. We have *cyber-attacks* mainly aimed at attacks on political grounds
    to share information that is not meant for the public. Lastly, we have *cyber-crime*,
    which is driven by financial gain and disruptions, which affects the various systems.
    There are already existing cyber threats, but as technology increases and advances,
    more threats appear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developments in cyber threats accompany every advancement within technology.
    Among the common cyber threats, we have phishing, malware, ransomware, and social
    engineering. *Social engineering* relies on interactions between humans, where
    the attacker befriends or uses the person to override the security measures to
    protect information [[18](#CR18)]. In such cases, the person who falls victim
    is left to bear the effects of the attack. Such attacks take planning, as most
    security measures also require physical cases to the devices or the building where
    the information is being keyed in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, *phishing* involves the use of fraud, whereby scammers send fraudulent
    emails, and they use them to gather the information they are aiming to acquire.
    The emails sent resemble emails from reliable sources used as a dangling carrot
    for the victims. *Ransomware* is given the name due to the ransom asked for once
    the attacker controls the information or system files. Ransomware involves the
    feeding of malware into the computer system. *Malware* involves introducing malicious
    software, which causes harm to the system file or grants access to the information
    within the system files. Cybercriminals use a structured language query to insert
    malicious ware or viruses to gain access to the information. SQL submits a malicious
    SQL statement, which gives criminals access to the database being targeted. There
    are others like a *man-in-the-middle* attack or the *denial of service*, among
    others. A look at past cyber-attacks will help provide a better view of how dangerous
    they can be.

- en: In December 2019, an organized cyber-crime unit leader was charged with the
    Dridex malware attack by the United States Department of Justice [[19](#CR19)].
    The government, the public, and infrastructure worldwide were affected by the
    malware. The thing about malware and the state of connectivity that we have today
    is that attackers can simultaneously affect many users. Currently, there is a
    surge in zero-days, which are threats that emerge and do not carry any detectable
    digital signatures [[20](#CR20)]. When attacks happen, the experts rely highly
    on the digital signature the hacker left to triangulate and gather information
    about them to get to the hacker. With a threat that has no detectable digital
    signature, it means it is hard to protect from. Notably, when dealing with cyber
    threats and enhancing cybersecurity, they triangulate and check the vulnerabilities
    the hacker used in cases of existing threats. The use of digital signatures sheds
    light on how the hackers got access to the network or system files. Within the
    information, they can now work on preventing such attacks by eradicating the vulnerabilities
    and upping the systems’ security. Cyber-attacks can come from hackers or even
    people looking to hurt the organization. It can be even those that we do not and
    could never suspect. That is why the issue becomes critical because, in such cases,
    they know the security protocols and applications in place. That is which security
    put in place should be very legitimate and strong to avoid such attacks. Unfortunately,
    for every safety measure, there is an override put in place for risk management.

    technology that we have to use, there is a requirement to give a certain amount
    of information. At times, the information is the basic protocol, while other times,
    it involves private information that helps identify the owner of the product.

    computer usage, phone usage, or any other device. Network security does not mean
    prevention from authorized members, but malware can corrupt the device’s information
    or cause the information to be lost entirely. With network security, we are covering
    the safeguard of the network infrastructure. Under network security, we can take
    several cybersecurity measures. We can compromise network security in various
    ways, and getting to know them gives us a way of handling them. One of the pernicious
    attacks is the denial of service, which is very popular within network security.
    Denial of service involves an attacker that is a hacker making the access of a
    network unavailable to the intended users for some time. It is very complicated
    to achieve, as in most cases, it involves compromising a network, which is a platform
    that is accessed by so many users a minute.

    up denying access to Twitter for so many users even though it was for a short
    time. A platform like Twitter is always busy flowing with people interacting,
    communicating, or using the app. It connects people globally; therefore, one cannot
    understand how many users it has per second globally. So imagine what a denial
    of service attack can do if it lasts for five minutes or more. Dyn company provides
    DNS services, and with the network attack, the intruders took control of over
    600 000 devices [[21](#CR21)]. In 2016, during a DDoS attack, it was discovered
    that they had used the Mirai IoT Botnet. Attacks were mainly on IP cameras and
    Routers. Such attacks leave the question of how we can up network security so
    that we can achieve cybersecurity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even then, the network DDoS attacks have declined since then, but that does
    not mean that they are not an issue to grapple with. Trends show that when there
    is a new vulnerability, the attacks increase for a time before they are mitigated,
    which leads them to slow down. Figure [1](#Fig1) below shows the trends of the
    DDoS attacks 2017–2018\. The Y-axis represents the attack size, while the darker
    the dots get, the more prevalent the attacks on that size. From 2017 to 2018 in
    January, there was an increase in attacks by density from 560 to 738 Mbps. That
    shows a tremendous increase in the attacks, and the move now is ensuring that
    we can give out workable security measures before the attacks. The attacks spur
    for a moment until they are discovered and then solved, but then the damage has
    already been done. Although it can be challenging, having measures in place that
    prevent attacks at all and risk management can help network security. The more
    the attacker stays within the network undetected, the more information they gather
    and the better chance of destroying the enterprise. They get to learn the company’s
    trends and can cause damages slowly because they do not arouse suspicion, and
    by the time they are done, they have done so much it is impossible to regain the
    previous state of the network. That is why cybersecurity should be applied before
    the attacks.![../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/507793_1_En_1_Chapter/507793_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png)

    there is a cybersecurity attack within the united states. Every day, several people
    are victims of the cyber threat and have to bearer the consequences. Research
    has shown that most of the attacks are made possible because of the insecure usernames
    and passwords we use. For creating a username and password, people tend to make
    the simplest so they can remember them. For anyone not within the IT department,
    they do not take time devising the most secure username of the password as long
    as they can remember them. For hackers, this is a fantastic opportunity for them,
    and they take advantage of that. One, there is the fact that the hacker is well
    versed with the workings of the technology and the networks; therefore, having
    a less complicated security measure makes things easier for them. The thing with
    cyber threats is that they do not necessarily target one sector. As long as the
    sector ash technology and networks, then they can easily fall victim to cyber-attacks.

    the manufacturers are more driven to release the products to the market. Cybersecurity
    comes as an afterthought when it comes to devices and networks out there. That
    is immediately when a product is complete. It is released into the market so that
    the consumers can have access, and the company can be on the trend of making money.
    Later on, when the devices and technology are within the market, they offer cybersecurity
    applications options. Some people have already suffered victims of cyber-attacks.
    As mentioned before, cyber-attacks and threats are evolving just as fast as cyberspace
    is developing. A modern technology is devised every day, so it is a cyber threat
    that develops [[25](#CR25)]. The same minds that come up with the updates for
    technology and the innovations are the same as those running the black and grey
    hackers. Therefore, when a new device or system is released into the world, they
    quickly identify the vulnerabilities and exploit them to their benefit before
    they are identified. That is why, with some cyber-attacks, it is always a case
    of cat and mouse. With the black hackers, they are still out before they can be
    tracked done, which is they are always a step ahead of the white hackers and other
    cyber experts who are working towards increasing and enacting cybersecurity. Most

    on the rise in cyber-attacks. The two attacks are hard to identify or even rectify
    before any damage is done. With such an attack, the hackers or exploiters identify
    the weak spots of the vulnerabilities. They then send coded messages or notifications
    to groups of people within their line of work. Therefore, the end-user has no
    idea they have a vulnerability within their system while groups out there are
    very well aware. They all can tap into the vulnerability and collect the information
    they need or want for their purposes. That is why, within their research and study,
    they suggested the use of two approaches so they can ensure that cybersecurity
    is applied. The two approaches included the use of artificial intelligence and
    the use of statistics and machine learning. With artificial intelligence, it is
    possible to identify the vulnerabilities before the black hackers. If not, the
    machine and statistics learning will immediately recognize a new entry into the
    system. Then the best ideology here is artificial intelligence, which is identifying
    the vulnerabilities. The access of new users or unauthorized users can be hard
    as the systems get new users, especially in platforms like websites and social
    media platforms. This system will detect any behavioural abnormality within the
    systems and even track the event sequences. With such systems, it becomes easier
    to maintain cybersecurity and even put it into action. In a world where technology
    is taking over, we have to be very ready to handle the distinct threat that is
    waiting to happen. The best way to do that is by enacting the use of more reliable

    past, so much has been used in restoring cybersecurity after attacks [[27](#CR27)].
    Cyber-attacks are not helping to handle, and ensuring one has cybersecurity beforehand

    They rely upon that confidentiality will be observed. Therefore, when there are
    cyber-attacks, their information and data are taken, they lose trust in the company,
    affecting their popularity within society. Companies rely heavily on how the population
    sees them. Image is essential for companies to survive, and if it is tainted,
    they are bound to lose customers. Like other sectors, even in cybersecurity, prevention
    is better than cure; thus, it is better to secure our systems than grapple to

    and especially interconnectivity. The Internet of Things is really on the rise,
    whereby everything is now getting connected via the provided networks. Different
    companies are working together so they can establish connectivity ranging from
    various sectors. A special report by Steve Morgan EIC of Cybercrime Magazine showed
    that by 2021, around $6 trillion would have been spent on cybersecurity. Such
    statistics show companies and individuals should take it upon themselves to ensure
    the security measures within their systems are strong to prevent attacks and spare
    the spending on handling a breach that has already occurred. With cyber-attacks,
    some are unpredictable and only come to light after it has happened. This is one
    weakness that cybersecurity applications face.

    importance of cybersecurity. Most only do it as it is necessary, especially with
    the accounts they have to create within their applications. Even then, they do
    not make them as strong as possible. The communication of information makes it
    possible for there to be a physical infrastructure within cyberspace. If one does
    not know the importance of cybersecurity applications, they do not put enough
    effort into securing their devices and systems. Today, we store all our information
    in the cloud, so if someone can access the cloud, they can paralyze someone technology-wise.
    Such events lead to identity theft, financial losses, among other losses. Creating
    awareness so the masses can understand how essential cybersecurity is something
    that needs to be done. The people within IT departments have the advantage of
    fully understanding the dangers of cyber threats and taking the required precautions.
    Even then, that is not enough within a company as the black hackers will look
    for the weak link and exploit that to their benefit. According to [[28](#CR28)],
    so many people ride on the idea that everything within the cyber-physical society
    will work things out by themselves. They forget the damage that can be inflicted
    can affect them too first hand. Ignorance is bliss, and we have to ensure that
    it is eradicated by creating awareness on the importance of cybersecurity and

- en: In recent years Blockchain, the core component of Bitcoin, has evolved extraordinarily
    quickly, and its use is no longer limited to digital currencies. A Blockchain
    is a distributed public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions.
    The distributed ledger records the transactions of Blockchain blocks, and every
    block is related with a hash function to preserve the chain with its previous
    block [[14](#CR14)]. The network elements/nodes will receive a pair of the public
    key and private key upon registering to the network. Public key works as a unique
    identifier for each element. Private key also helps to sign transactions in the
    network and is used for encryption and decryption. The transactions are received
    by all the nodes and are validated. They are grouped into a timestamped block
    by few nodes designated as miners [[14](#CR14)]. Blockchain is a “*No Central
    Authority*,” consensus algorithm used to select a block, among the number of blocks
    created by the miners, added to the Blockchain network. For making any changes
    to the existing block of data, all the nodes present in the network run algorithms
    to evaluate, verify, and match the transaction information with Blockchain history.
    If the majority of the nodes agree in favor of the transaction, then it is approved,
    and a new block gets added to the existing chain.

    Using its distributed ledger, we can securely store millions of data within its

    users’ modifications and changes have to be approved through its proof of work
    protocol. Likewise, this system allows for a trustless principle where all transactions
    are anonymous, but they stay recorded in the chain. All of these measures go towards
    keeping the integrity of data. This is one of the issues or limitations of Blockchain.

    is a method by which a blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus.
    The proof of work (PoW) method, on the other hand, asks users to repeatedly run
    hashing algorithms or different client puzzles to validate electronic transactions.
    Both ways are thought upon leveraging that any change made on the Blockchain is

    technology, but basically, the idea has always been the same. We have some input
    data set. We have some objective we have something that we want the AI to do in
    this case, classify an object (say a pine tree) as a pine tree or is it not a
    pine tree, so what we do is we feed this AI a training set of images of different
    types of trees. Hence, the idea is that the AI learns the mapping the relationship
    between the input data and output data (labels). The idea is that the Human would
    have to extract all the features of what it means to be a pine tree; the shape
    of a tree, the leaves, the length of the stem …etc. This was a very tiring process,
    but this is what humans by hand, and so what happened is once we’ve extracted
    those features, we would feed it to some kind of machine learning model. There’s
    a lot out there; eventually, it would learn the mapping and then give it a new
    tree picture, and it would know this is a pine. In recent years, a neural network
    which is machine learning model, we feed it with the dataset and massive computing

    bank being the third party, there are a group of people called miners, and anybody
    can become a miner; you just need a computing device right, and the idea is that
    when someone (let say it is me) transmit value to (you), these miners have to
    approve this transaction and say okay. Let me check this list of transactions,
    so every miner has a copy of every transaction that has occurred in the network,

    as if there were different miners! Because of such a scenario, Satoshi Nakamoto
    said every single miner has to prove that they have solved some random mathematical
    problem; it’s called the proof of work algorithm (PoW) [[16](#CR16)], and that
    means that you have to have more computing power than the fastest supercomputers
    in the world combined with having the majority of the computing power in the Bitcoin

    Artificial Intelligence is based on prediction and probability models. What we
    can do is to combine Blockchain and AI together. We can use this immutable ledger

    of decentralized storage source. Let us imagine that we can allow AI to live on
    the Blockchain that means it has full access to the power of immutable decentralized
    architecture and a very secure signature. If AI lives there and no human intermediary
    is available, we are giving the AI the full power to learn, adapt, and expand
    and then gain control! (scary right?) Knowing the PoW algorithm and the need for
    supercomputers to hack and attack, it is not easy to shut down such a huge monster
    trying to get control. This convergence of AI and Blockchain needs to be normalized
    and regulated so that we can keep control. Recently, a model called *SecNet,*

    has a multi-layered defense mechanism against any attempts to attack or enter
    by authorized members. That is using encryptions with over two authentication
    methods for access. Such a defense mechanism can work very well with the mobile
    technology we have taken up in our daily proceedings. In the same line, handle
    the third-party vendors here. We can ensure they adhere to the security policies
    of the company. This can be achieved by offering the service level agreement,
    so they can fully understand and concur with terms, especially as they do not
    fall under the company’s staff, but they associate with the company regularly.
    It could also be a go-ahead to include Identity and Access Management (IAM). It
    provides for who will access what within an enterprise under both the employees’
    docket and the customers. With identity and access management, it is easier to
    monitor employees’ activities in terms of how often and what information and systems
    they are accessing. It can help in identifying when they have accessed a system
    that they are not supposed to. With a breach, it is easier to determine where
    the vulnerability was and work to rectify it as soon as possible.

    in all ways possible that he or she can think of. This exercise identifies the
    vulnerabilities the system might have so they can override it. As long as they
    have real-time intelligence, a company or an individual can avoid any threats
    getting in. Imagine being in a situation where you know when you are about to
    get into danger. That would give you ample time to work on the way to avoid the
    threat coming your way. The same works with the audits; they give real-time information
    the black hackers could have otherwise used. With the information, they can rectify
    their weak links and put effective measures in place. Information and data stored
    within systems are crucial, and in the wrong hands, it can cause so much harm
    [[34](#CR34)]. On personal levels, this can be substituted by the regular updates
    on the security systems that have been input into the devices we are using. With

    to manage cybersecurity applications. One of the best ways to manage cyber-attacks
    and threats is to understand how the attacker thinks and maneuvers within the
    system. An overlook of how the defense actions and the competing attacks react
    and relate with each other is a revelation on so many levels. The cybersecurity
    issue is that there is a new emerging threat every day that was not there before
    [[35](#CR35)]. Therefore, tactics used a month ago may not apply to a recent threat
    now, which is why the cybersecurity applications team should always be alert.
    Defensive designs are created to tackle unforeseen attacks that have not happened
    before that predict and work. If they do appear, they can handle them and protect
    the data, information, or network in question. There is a need to stimulate such
    a scenario for this kind of understanding and apply multiple attackers with different
    behaviors and environmental enhancements [[36](#CR36)]. Such a setup is difficult
    to develop, but with genetic programming, it is made possible.

    light on how the attacks can happen and the best ways to subdue them, if not prevent
    them from happening at all [[37](#CR37)]. For the success of genetic programming,
    there is a need to conduct some cybersecurity research, which will help alienate
    the data needed to identify the best defense to use against attacks. In such cases,
    it is used to determine the vulnerabilities or attacks that are yet to happen
    to cultivate a defense mechanism that will help in doing so [[38](#CR38)]. Below
    are examples of applications it associates with to eliminate the areas that are
    not likely to be attacked so that by the end of the process, it can identify weak
    areas. Network defense investigation deals with the isolation defenses, distributed
    denial of service, and others, within cybersecurity. The defense of the physical
    infrastructure is also essential to determine the systems are interacting. Then
    there is vulnerability testing and the detection of anomalies, which will help
    identify areas that can be hot spots for the hackers to access.

    As mentioned before, the threats are new to the systems. Organizations have to
    take the risk by taking the security measures they believe are best suited before
    getting any black hackers’ intrusion. Before then, they have to administer robust
    identification access management, the nature of the vulnerability, and the data
    that can be accessed if they exploit the vulnerability [[39](#CR39)]. Taking risk
    management approaches is not that simple, and they have to make sure that with
    the known variable, they have the correct data on a piece of information to act
    on it. Lack of awareness is one challenge that is mainly faced by cybersecurity
    applications. That is why, within organizations, they should conduct training
    sessions for the employees. That way, they will know how to go about cybersecurity,
    and it becomes easier to identify or detect an intrusion if they know what to
    observe. With training and awareness, there can be a reduction in recovery and
    discovery times when dealing with cyber-attacks.

    as technology advances means they are always running and open for discoveries.
    Therefore, younger generations should be encouraged to engage in cyber-related
    professions to have better control over the issue. Research has shown that there
    is little understanding of the dynamics of information technology, which includes
    cybersecurity. Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain are born out of human behaviors
    that have worked in the past, prediction, responsiveness, and validation, making
    them two of the most promising security measures for the near future. Potential
    Applications in Information Security may allow Blockchains to manage digital identities,
    protect large amounts of data, and secure edge devices. A few critical elements
    make Blockchain one of the most secure suppliers of cyber defense. It is capable
    of supplying protection for financial activities such as cryptocurrency transactions.
    Some of the characteristics that make Blockchain very secure are decentralization,
    immutability, and accountability. Blockchain implements numerous cryptographic
    protocols, most of which are difficult to decipher. The integration of Blockchain
    and AI technologies can empower AI by providing a secure and trustful environment.
