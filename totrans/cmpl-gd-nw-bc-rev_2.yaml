- en: A blockchain is a decentralized ledger where everyone’s transaction history
    is stored. This ledger automatically gets updated in regular time frames, is accepted
    by the community as a fact, and gets stored on every participant’s computer. This
    way, no central party has to govern the network, as issues like double spending
    rarely exist in this ecosystem.

- en: Instead of a central party dictating what is “real,” the community does so in
    a decentralized manner. Blockchain technology thereby allows storage of any kind
    of information without needing a governing body. This can be applied to any type
    of ownership, identification, knowledge, or…currency.

    exist without a central bank. Currency is one of the many different applications
    that can run on a blockchain, using the benefits of decentralization in the digital
    world.

- en: In a cryptocurrency, any rule or regulation is programmed into the cryptographic
    algorithm that governs the decentralized community using the currency. The combination
    of cryptography and currencies gives crypto-currencies their name. This basically
    means a currency that is backed by and made rare through cryptography.

    Since this is a new concept compared to thousands of years of using precious metals,
    it will take a bit of time until more and more people start to understand the
    true benefits of the new system.

- en: There have been several cultures around the world that refused to have a centralized
    monetary system. While it is very hard to say which one was the largest or first,
    the concept of Rai stones on the island of Yap is quite fascinating and describes
    the concept of a blockchain and decentralized currency in an easy to understand
    way. The Islanders did not own much gold, so in order to have some kind of currency
    that everyone could have access to if they wanted, they carved huge round stones
    out of limestone. They would then be used as currency. In theory, every islander
    would have been able to do this, but it mostly became a specialized task done
    by few, while the others preferred to sell products or services to receive such
    stones in return. The system was decentralized, as it was completely open for
    anyone to join, and everyone had the same rights.

- en: Looking at blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you will recognize how similar this
    concept of the Rai stones actually is—with the difference that Rai stones are
    physical, and cryptocurrencies are digital. That is why cryptocurrencies need
    a blockchain as an underlying technology.

    many people becoming interested to know why this technology matters. It’s expected
    that as 2018 draws toward its end, we will be able to know just how well blockchain
    fits into the nerves of the society.
