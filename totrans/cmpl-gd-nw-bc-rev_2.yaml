- en: A blockchain is a decentralized ledger where everyone’s transaction history
    is stored. This ledger automatically gets updated in regular time frames, is accepted
    by the community as a fact, and gets stored on every participant’s computer. This
    way, no central party has to govern the network, as issues like double spending
    rarely exist in this ecosystem.

  zh: 区块链是一个分布式账本，每个人的交易历史都存储在其中。这个账本定期自动更新，被社区接受为事实，并存储在每位参与者的电脑上。这样，就不需要中央实体来管理网络，因为在这个生态系统中，双重支付等问题很少出现。
- en: Instead of a central party dictating what is “real,” the community does so in
    a decentralized manner. Blockchain technology thereby allows storage of any kind
    of information without needing a governing body. This can be applied to any type
    of ownership, identification, knowledge, or…currency.

    algorithm that governs the decentralized community using the currency. The combination
    of cryptography and currencies gives crypto-currencies their name. This basically
    means a currency that is backed by and made rare through cryptography.

  zh: WHAT WAS THE FIRST DECENTRALIZED CURRENCY?
- en: There have been several cultures around the world that refused to have a centralized
    monetary system. While it is very hard to say which one was the largest or first,
    the concept of Rai stones on the island of Yap is quite fascinating and describes
    the concept of a blockchain and decentralized currency in an easy to understand
    way. The Islanders did not own much gold, so in order to have some kind of currency
    that everyone could have access to if they wanted, they carved huge round stones
    out of limestone. They would then be used as currency. In theory, every islander
    would have been able to do this, but it mostly became a specialized task done
    by few, while the others preferred to sell products or services to receive such
    stones in return. The system was decentralized, as it was completely open for
    anyone to join, and everyone had the same rights.

  zh: 世界上有几种文化曾经拒绝采用集中货币系统。虽然很难说哪一种文化是最大的或是最早的，但雅普岛上Rai石的概念非常迷人，并以一种容易理解的方式描述了区块链和去中心化货币的概念。岛上居民并不拥有很多黄金，因此为了拥有一种每个人想要时都可以参与的货币，他们从石灰岩上雕刻出巨大的圆形石头。这些石头将被用作货币。从理论上讲，每个岛民都可能做到这一点，但实际
    mostly 成为了一个由少数人专门从事的特殊任务，而其他人则更愿意提供产品或服务以换取这些石头。该系统是去中心化的，因为它是完全开放的，任何人都可以加入，并且每个人拥有相同的权利。
- en: Looking at blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you will recognize how similar this
    concept of the Rai stones actually is—with the difference that Rai stones are
    physical, and cryptocurrencies are digital. That is why cryptocurrencies need
    a blockchain as an underlying technology.
