    tolerable when there was no alternative, are unendurable in the face of the new
    computer technologies now on the horizon—technologies in which, happily, the U.S.
    leads the world.” At the time, I called the new device a “telecomputer.” My friend
    Bruce Chapman, the founder of the Discovery Institute, suggested I change the
    word to the more elegant “teleputer” in subsequent editions, and so I did.'

    “In 1969 a sixteen-year-old boy wrote to conservative columnist William F. Buckley,
    Jr., ‘to discover just what, in God’s name, the phrase “to immanentize the eschaton”
    means.’ Buckley replied: ‘Eschaton means, roughly, the final things in the order
    of time; immanentize means, roughly, to cause to inhere in time. So that to immanentize
    the eschaton is to cause to inhere in the worldly experience and subject to human
    dominion that which is beyond time and therefore extraworldly. To attempt such
    a thing is to deny the transcendence of God; to assume that Utopia is for this
    world.’'

    basically means to bring about the end of the world (i.e., ‘the final things in
    the order of time’). It may be said, that those who deny the transcendence of
    God carry within themselves the apocalypse as they attempt to build their silly
    Utopia. For what better way is there for bringing about the ‘end times’? Those
    who would free us from racism, sexism and classism, seeking to make ‘the world
    as one,’ fail to realize that humanity isn’t perfectible; that any attempt to
    make men perfect is likely to confuse essential instincts, breaking up whatever
    workable order we’ve managed to achieve.”

    pessimistically, as indicating there are limits to human knowledge. The optimistic
    interpretation, which I prefer, is that omega shows that one cannot do mathematics
    mechanically and that intuition and creativity are essential. Indeed, in a sense
    omega is the crystalized, concentrated essence of mathematical creativity.”'

    of the emperor of China and the inventor of chess. The emperor was so grateful
    for the invention that he offered the inventor anything he asked. The inventor
    said, “Just a grain of rice on the first square of the chessboard . . . and a
    doubling of the grains on each subsequent square of the 64.” Not a mathematician,
    the emperor readily agreed to the exponential process. To produce 2^(64) (minus
    1) grains, the emperor would have to award the inventor roughly eighteen million
    trillion grains, or all the rice ever grown on earth times some factor. As Kurzweil
    would point out, the emperor’s troubles would begin when the doubling moved to
    the second half of the chessboard. Kurzweil would speculate on two possible endings:
    one, the inventor takes over the kingdom; two, the inventor is decapitated. The
    lesson for inventors is keep an eye on the emperor.'

    This book is a trove of the 1990s research in distributed systems and cryptography
    that flowered in the cryptocurrency eruption of our time. “Mojo,” one of the first
    proposed crypto tokens, and eCash, are precursor cryptocurrencies discussed by
    Michael Freedman and others throughout. Freedman worked on micropayments, “zero-knowledge
    proofs,” digital cash, mathematical hashes, and other relevant pursuits at MIT
    and Princeton. In Peer-to-Peer, he contributed to a chapter on “Free Haven” (an
    anonymous storage system wherein the publishers of documents determine the lifetime
    of the document), 159–187\. His chapter “Accountability” (271–340) addresses micropayments,
    “hash cash,” reputation systems, double-spending, proof-of-work, and other issues
    familiar on the blockchain. Co-author with Freedman on both papers were Roger
    Dingledine, student of Ron Rivest, one of the eponymous inventors of RSA security
    and an enthusiast with Adi Shamir of digital cash, and David Molnar, a prominent
    crypto-elite from Berkeley, Harvard, and Microsoft. Any of these guys was probably

    See also, The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside our Heads (New
    York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2016), where (in a footnote!), Wu acknowledges that diverging
    from a network-neutral business strategy was what caused AOL’s downfall: “For
    the walled garden ultimately was a weaker offering than the full variety offered
    on the Internet.” As he concludes, the pursuit of the advertising riches of TV
    on a non-broadcast medium controlled by customers could never work. Wu gives us
    the delicious quote from AOL CEO Steve Case: “What really bothers me,” he said,
    “is the ads are in a place where members will see them.”'

    “Smart radios suggest not a beach but the endless waves of the ocean itself . . .
    In general, the FCC should not be in the business of licensing spectrum. It should
    instead issue driver’s licenses for radios [all electromagnetic transmitters].
    A heavy burden of proof should fall on any service providers with blind or high-powered
    systems, who maintain that they cannot operate without an exclusive license, who
    want to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the surf.”'

    the most creative parts of the economy is rectified by economist Mark Skousen’s
    new concept of Gross Output (GO) or gross domestic expenditures. Adopted by the
    Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis in December 2013, GO includes intermediate
    spending on capital goods and commodities, not just final sales registered in
    GDP. Because GO includes savings and capital formation—entrepreneurial creativity
    in crypto, for example—Skousen’s index correlates much better with subsequent
    growth than does GDP, which rises anomalously with government debt and transfer
    payments. While economists disparage GO for double-counting the sale of components
    of the car and the car itself, GDP double-counts food, medicine, and other supports
    for human labor. The economy is a manifold of overlapping goods and services being
    constantly transformed. Any measurement of it incurs the double-counting problem.'
