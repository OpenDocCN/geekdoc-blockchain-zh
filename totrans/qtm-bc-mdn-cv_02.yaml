- en: This chapter further accentuates the aspect of quantum technology, built upon
    the basics of quantum information that is dealt in the previous chapter. A brief
    review is made on two primary quantum information processing tasks, being quantum
    communication and quantum sensing. Quantum communication is additionally divided
    into quantum cryptography and quantum blockchain, respectively. In quantum cryptography,
    the feature of security in quantum cryptosystems is commented upon. Quantum blockchain
    encompasses the nature and the networking of the framework to witness decentralized,
    distributed and public digital ledger in quantum domain. Finally, the emergence
    of quantum sensing from particles/systems that are described by quantum mechanics,
    like photons, is introduced.

- en: 'The era of quantum communication began in the early 1980’s when the scientists
    started to think of using quantum states as information carriers. Until then,
    the foundational aspect of quantum mechanics was the primary focus in the community.
    Though a few earlier works indicated the possibility of such a prospect, the area
    of quantum communication gained incredible attention only after Bennett and Brassard
    proposed a protocol for key distribution and coin tossing in 1984 (hence the name
    ‘BB84’). The BB84 protocol was based on the idea of conjugate coding, which was
    first observed by Wiesner a few years earlier. The present unit of the chapter
    focuses mainly on two aspects of quantum communication, namely quantum cryptography
    and quantum block-chain. The former deals with the information in the system (qubit)
    and the secrecy associated with it. Quantum cryptography still remains to be a
    large area of exploration and investigation of numerous two-or-more party schemes.
    In the present book, we shall limit the discussion to quantum key distribution
    protocols and specifically, counterfactual-based protocols. But a brief summary
    of a few other cryptogrphic tasks shall be made. The latter part of the unit will
    cover the elucidation of blockchains technology with qubits. This section primarily
    addresses the issue of networking and sharing in regard to quantum systems and
    the relevant conceptual problems. Though the classical block-chain technology
    offers various features and it’s advancement in recent past is very promising,
    the quantum counterpart is worth in pursuing for it’s own advantages. For one,
    the research on quantum block-chain technology will influence other areas where
    networking is of utmost importance (Eg: quantum internet).'

    to quantum communication, followed by quantum sensing in Sect. [2](#Sec29). In
    particular, Sect. [1](#Sec1) includes two major parts—quantum cryptography and
    quantum blockchain. With a brief introduction to quantum cryptography in Sect. [1.2.1](#Sec4),
    the subsequent subsections contain the aspects of quantum counterfactuality (Sect. [1.2.2](#Sec5)),
    recent advancement in counterfactual security (Sects.  [1.2.3](#Sec6) and [1.2.4](#Sec7)),
    ending with a brief description of an experimental version of quantum counterfactual
    QKD protocol (Sects. [1.2.5](#Sec8) and [1.2.6](#Sec9)). Section [1.3](#Sec11)
    covers the introduction to blockchain technology, accompanied by a comment on
    the difference between classical and quantum blockchains (Sects. [1.3.6](#Sec17)
    and [1.4](#Sec21)), along with an example of demonstration in IBM Q Experience
    (Sects. [1.5.1](#Sec24) and [1.6](#Sec28)). Finally, Sect. [2](#Sec29) remarks
    on the need and advantages of quantum sensing, by considering certain systems
    as source of quantumness. A brief observation is made on the limitations, challenges
    (Sect. [2.3](#Sec32)) and applications (Sect. [2.4](#Sec38)) as well.

    The merit of information is usually dependent on three factors: relevance, reproducibility
    (or accuracy) and scope of progression [[1](#CR1)]. The term ‘information’ here
    refers to the outcome of knowing about something; or simply knowledge. The importance
    of validating an information is thus as much as the information itself.'

    of the information are relevant as long as they are secret. The need for secrecy
    is not new [[2](#CR2)]. We had days of secret information transmission from pigeons,
    some standard encryption methods and even human involvement oftentimes. Almost
    three centuries ago, mathematicians found out an organized way of encryption and
    decryption—secrecy guaranteed by some mathematical theorem [[3](#CR3)]. After
    the advent of information age (almost one and a half century ago), the conventional
    encoding-decoding methods were replaced by better protocols which potentially
    used some non-linear mathematical models to guarantee the security.

    or hidden and ‘graphein’ which means to write or study. It can be defined as the
    practice and systematic study of techniques/methods for secret communication.
    The information sent from one party to another must be protected from leaking
    to adversaries, who are at least as powerful and efficient as the communicating
    parties. Thus the secrecy of information is of utmost importance and hence the
    need for seeking better techniques that is robust against more powerful adversary.

    encodes the states) and ‘Bob’ (the receiver who decodes them), who want to perform
    a cryptographic task, either in the presence of ‘Eve’ (an eavesdropper) or an
    untrusted party. The classical cryptography involves a cryptographic task whose
    security is based on computational complexity of some mathematical problem. A
    prototypical example is using hardness of factorizing a large number.

    and decoding the plain text and depending on the nature of the key used, there

    number of cryptographic task at a later point in time (as they both can use a

    but Alice and Bob are quantum enabled and so is Eve. Specifically, Alice, Bob
    and Eve have access to quantum systems, can perform quantum operations and communicate
    through quantum channels. The details of each of these was introduced in the previous
    chapter. Thus Alice and Bob (and Eve) have two channels; authenticated classical
    channel and insecure quantum channel. In particular, the message that is sent
    from Alice to Bob (or vice-versa) in former can be listened by anyone, but cannot
    be changed and anyone can attack and change the message in the latter. For an
    overview on QC, refer this—[[4](#CR4)].

    secret key, which potentially could be used to send a secret message in the future.
    This type of secret key generation between two or more parties is generally called
    a protocol of quantum key distribution (QKD). Below listed steps are of BB84 protocol

    will have to choose one of the two basis (or their combination) to do so. But
    as we see in the above table, if she chooses a wrong basis, she has to send a
    photon of random polarization. In other words, the states available to Eve are
    non-orthogonal and she cannot perfectly distinguish them. Also, she cannot simply
    ‘copy’ a state and measure it later, as no-cloning principle restricts her to
    do so. Thus she will be caught when Alice and Bob test for error in the channel.

    in 2009 [[12](#CR12)] (called ‘Noh09’). This too is based on the principle of
    IFM, but enables Alice and Bob to share an identical set of bit strings—secret
    key. In CQKD, one arm of the beam-splitter is retained at Alice’s station and
    the other extends till Bob’s station. ‘Counterfactuality’ in the relevant sense
    means that a particle was detected elsewhere from where the blocking action happened.
    The term ‘counterfactual’ was coined by Roger Penrose to explain this phenomenon

    the weak trace left by the photon when it gets detected at one of the detectors
    at Alice’s station. Thus according to this definition, only in one case the detection
    is truly counterfactual. This however is limited only to direct communication
    protocols, as QKD protocols make use of orthogonal states, rather than identical
    states as is the case in the former. Thus the encoding is not based on whether
    Bob blocked or reflected, but whether Bob applied ![$$R_\uparrow $$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq84.png)

    counterfactual and Bell-type state based. A different kind of IFM-based QKD protocol
    was introduced, which increased the efficiency, while not compromising in security.
    The benefit of employing counterfactual protocol for QKD is that: (a) Since it
    is an orthogonal-state based protocol, the setup includes simpler state preparation
    and measurement devices; (b) The potential key bits are not used for error estimation
    and this results in the origin of counterfactual security; (c) The efficiency
    of BB84 can also be attained with the proposed modification to the SC-QKD protocol.

    referring to a decentralized digital ledger. But the disadvantage of the same
    is that the system is extremely ingenious and has poor efficiency. It is a public
    ledger with no middle man to handle the exchange, where a user can anonymously
    transfer funds and information without the fear of the transaction being leaked,
    deleted, or edited from the public ledger. The idea of blockchain employs ideas
    like the hash algorithm, proof of work. These terminologies can then be correlated
    with a few quantum protocols and used in quantum analogue of blockchain, the *Quantum

    by a group of computers and not owned by a single organisation.. Transactions
    are the basic elements of a blockchain, many transactions form a block, many blocks
    form a blockchain bound using a digital data connection. The three Ds i.e. decentralized
    infrastructure, disintermediator, and distributed ledger are the main features
    of a blockchain and, because of these characteristics, efficient blockchains have
    enormous applications. The objective of a blockchain is to verify and validate
    a transaction initiated by a participant and to record the proof of these actions
    with the consent of other participants. First, we build the necessary terminologies
    and then understand the entire workflow of a quantum blockchain.

    the nodes. As mentioned before, there is no central authority to look after the
    transactions, which makes these general agreements between peers the only way
    for all the peers to be on the same page regarding the blockchain. One such consensus
    algorithm is the Proof of work algorithm (POW).POW is an application of the hash
    algorithm, which allows to prove that a certain amount of work has been carried
    out. During the process of mining, a miner needs to solve the proof of work puzzle(the
    complex problem referred to in the previous section) in order to add new blocks
    to the database. The POW puzzle is a non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard)
    problem. The concept used here is that the POW puzzle is a mathematical problem
    and hard to solve, thus solving and providing the solution for the POW puzzle
    ensures the integrity of the entire database. Also, puzzle-solving requires a
    great number of computational resources (very time-consuming) and also has some
    limitations. The limitations and disadvantages have been enhanced and a new consensus

    resolve the problem of integer factoring in polynomial time and poses a threat

    Grover’s algorithm which provides a speedup for an unstructured search problem
    quadratically can be used in the process of mining to find the hash values satisfying
    the conditions in a shorter time using a quantum computer [[34](#CR34)]. This

    photon of the block is absorbed immediately this provides us to perform a similar
    action to timestamp for each block. Thus in the blockchain whenever records are
    generated they are encoded in the temporal bell states,then these photons are
    created and absorbed at their respective times. For eg:![$$\begin{aligned} |\beta

    are still left to construct the quantum chain using GHZ states and the concept
    of entanglement in time. We need link the bit strings of the bell state in a chronological
    order forming a chain like structure for which, we use the fusion process where
    we recursively project the temporal bell states into a growing temporal GHZ state.
    Performing the process of fusion physically requires a entangled photon-pair source,
    a delay line, and a polarising beam splitter (PBS).After which we receive the
    following state:![$$\begin{aligned} |\text {GHZ}_{r_1r_2 \dots r_{2n}}\rangle

    how close the state they share is to the ideal GHZ state and verify whether or
    not it contains genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Verifying GME in multipartite
    GHZ states in this way is relevant to a wide variety of protocols in distributed
    quantum computation and quantum communication. Furthermore, each node in the quantum
    network would host a copy of the quantum blockchain hence, if a node tampers with
    its own local copy, it does not affect the copies at the other nodes analogous

    when compared to a set of hash values, there is chance that even after traversing

    we extend the nonce register to 48 bits. Therefore classically to handle a 48-bit

- en: Along with the standardization of units, efforts have been put in to make measurements
    more precise and accurate. This eventually led to the question of how small can
    we ultimately measure? Since then, scientists and engineers have been investigating
    the limits of detecting physical quantities like distance, time, mass, force,
    etc. As it was observed that these quantities change with environmental conditions,
    this resulted in redefining these physical quantities based on natural constants.
    Up until the late 19th century, it was assumed that measurements can be arbitrarily
    precise as long as a sufficiently sensitive measurement device or technique can
    be engineered. For example, the position measurement of a particle is classically
    limited by the thermal noise due to the equilibrium bath temperature which creates
    excitations in the particle motion resulting in the error of position measurement.
    Thus, it was postulated that at ground state the particle motion would completely
    freeze, thereby eliminating any fluctuation in position measurement. However,
    this supposition was falsified with the development of quantum mechanics. Based
    on the postulates of quantum mechanics, every measurement is fundamentally imprecise.
    This means, even at its ground state, every quantum system has an intrinsic fluctuation
    called as the zero-point motion of the system. This zero-point energy is the result
    of the famous Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle (Eq. [36](#Equ39)).![$$\begin{aligned}
    \varDelta x \varDelta p \ge \frac{\hbar }{4\pi } \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_Equ39.png)(36)![](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Fig13_HTML.png)

- en: According to the Uncertainty Principle, an accurate measurement of one parameter
    will introduce an inaccuracy in the measurement of another parameter. This behaviour
    is the result of a statistical error in the measurement of a variable. This error
    can be intuitively seen as a disturbance in one variable while the other variable
    is measured. Such two variables whose measurements affect each other are known
    as conjugate pairs. A well-known example of such a conjugate pair is the position
    and linear momentum. Thus, when the position of a particle is measured, the process
    of measurement itself exerts a back-action force on the particle which creates
    an uncertainty in the measurement of its linear momentum. This means, the higher
    the sampling frequency of measurement, the larger will be the back-action force
    that is exerted on the particle. On the other hand, if the measurement sampling
    frequency is lowered, then the fraction of measurement error to expected value
    becomes large. As a result, the uncertainty in the measurement begin to dominate
    and the signal-to-noise ratio again increases. Therefore, an optimum point exists
    in any given measurement where the sum total of back-action noise and measurement
    noise is at its overall minimum. This minimum additional noise is known as the
    Standard Quantum Limit of the ground-state of the system (Eq. [37](#Equ40)).![$$\begin{aligned}
    \sqrt{S_fS_x} \approx \hbar \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_Equ40.png)(37)The
    understanding of quantum mechanics and the limitations it imposed also paved the
    way for overcoming these limitations to some extent. For example, the aforementioned
    uncertainty in the measurement of position can be reduced below its ground state
    value by intentionally increasing the uncertainty in momentum of the coherent
    state. In this way, the measurement error of a quantum system can be lowered than
    the one set by the standard quantum limit. Such a non-classical quantum state
    is called as a “Squeezed Coherent State”, and is nowadays commonly used in interferometry-based
    experiments and even in atomic-clocks to improve their precision [[38](#CR38)].
    Another example of a quantum phenomenon being used to improve measurement sensitivity
    is the quantum wave interference. In this case, a superposition of two quantum
    states is created, and the physical parameter to be measured is observed as a
    change in the probability distribution of the superposition states in the form
    of a change in the phase of the Bloch vector. As such, quantum sensing can be
    defined as “the use of a controlled quantum coherent state of well-defined and
    quantized energy levels for measuring a physical quantity beyond its classical
    limit” [[39](#CR39)].

    quantities including, but not limited to, distance, force, magnetic flux, charge,
    energy, time, phase, and acceleration. The noise power spectral densities of these
    physical quantities go far below the classical limit, and in some cases orders
    of magnitude lower. For example, a SQUID based magnetometer has magnetic field
    sensitivity up to 3 ![$$fT/\sqrt{Hz}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq252.png)
    [[40](#CR40)] which is small enough to measure the magnetic fields produced by
    the brain, while the spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) atomic magnetometer
    has reached a field sensitivity of 200 ![$$aT/\sqrt{Hz}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq253.png)
    [[41](#CR41)]. Thus, such quantum sensors are highly useful in medical diagnosis
    and geospatial imaging. In comparison to this, classical magnetometers have their
    sensitivity limited to a few nm [[42](#CR42)]. Similarly, atomic clocks have considerably
    enhanced satellite-based navigation and can locate a GPS device with accuracy
    less a meter. In order to provide this positional accuracy at geosynchronous orbits,
    the atomic clocks in the satellites must have Allen deviation in the order of
    a few tens of attoseconds. This is possible because the atoms are ground-state
    cooled using magneto-optical traps in order to have lower phonon-induced noise.
    This opens opportunities in defence navigation and space missions for positioning
    and imaging. Beyond the engineering and technological applications of quantum
    sensors, they are becoming more and more crucial in high-energy particle physics,
    physical hypothesis testing and experimental astrophysics. For example, levitating
    systems have been proposed as a promising platform for testing quantum-gravity
    interaction and wavefunction collapse mechanism [[43](#CR43), [44](#CR44)]. Another
    interesting application of quantum sensors are in the investigation of dark matter
    by attempting to detect some proposed dark matter particles like Axions [[45](#CR45)]
    and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) [[46](#CR46)].

- en: Photons are natural quanta of energy with a specific energy. This makes an ensemble
    of photons of a given frequency identical to each other. Thus, high-precision
    sensing can be achieved by counting the number of photons emitted by a single-photon
    source, which indirectly transduces the signal to be measured into electromagnetic
    wave packets. Single-photon detection and photon correlation for time-resolved
    counting has been used in a wide range of technological applications like imaging
    and communication. For example, LiDAR, QKD, DNA sequencing, Fluorescence-lifetime
    Imaging, and Photon Correlation Spectroscopy are all based on single-photon detection
    and/or correlation techniques. Although this approach is widely studied and implemented,
    the detection signal is limited by shot noise or measurement noise , which reduces
    the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Shot noise originates from the statistical quantum
    fluctuations in the number of photons hitting the detector. Since this is a statistical
    error which increasing with lowering of sample size, to improve the signal-to-noise
    ratio, more averaging of the signal must be done. This in turn increases the measurement
    time, and depending on the detection technique implemented, this may increase
    the measurement noise. Thus, for a more sensitive measurement, non-classical states
    of photons must be used [[49](#CR49)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As discussed in the previous Sect. [2](#Sec29), the minimum of the combined
    measurement (shot) noise and back-action noise is given by the SQL, where the
    products of the standard deviations of position and momentum are equal to ![$$\hbar
    /2$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq258.png). Although
    this limit, given by the Heisenberg’s Principle, is a physical barrier to how
    low the total error in measurement can be, one can certainly decrease the error
    in one variable at the expense of the other while keeping the product such that
    the Heisenberg’s Principle is obeyed. Such a quantum state is called as a Squeezed
    Coherent State, where the measurement error in the position of the photon is reduced
    while making the momentum more uncertain [[50](#CR50), [51](#CR51)]. This is achieved
    by using non-linear optics like the optical parametric amplifier [[52](#CR52)].
    Squeezed light is already used in LIGO experiments for detecting cosmic gravitational
    waves using laser interferometry [[53](#CR53)].

- en: Further, Mach-Zehnder type interferometer can lead to imaging beyond the Rayleigh
    criterion, thereby outperforming the classical optical imaging [[52](#CR52), [54](#CR54)].
    Quantum interferometers that use entangled states and squeezed light can be used
    to create interference that is kilometres long, and thus can be used in quantum
    communication for encrypted information transfer. Similarly, an interferometer
    with a single-photon source can generate EPR correlation between two entangled
    single-photons. This can be used for quantum read-out of optical memories like
    CDs and DVDs, leading to error-free and faster read-out rates and allows for denser
    packing of information. The major challenge in such single photon based applications
    is the efficiency of the single-photon source and sensitivity of the detectors.
    Also, measures must be taken to prevent loss of photons to optical absorption
    or decoherence that can cause loss of information. Recently, the well-defined
    properties of a photon, like frequency and polarization, have been used to store
    quantum information. The information is encoded in the form of non-classical states,
    like coherent or entangled states. This can be used to map quantum information
    of an atom’s quantum state to that of a photon. This light-matter interaction
    is well exploited in quantum computing applications, but can be also be used for
    quantum sensing. Research also predicts development of quantum microwave spectroscopy
    and quantum radar using similar principles [[55](#CR55)] (Fig. [14](#Fig14) and

    magnetic resonance (NMR) has achieved sensitivities of 20-30 fT/![$$\sqrt{Hz}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq260.png)
    [[60](#CR60)]. Spin quantum systems gives an advantage of high sensitivity and
    low SNR compared to classical magnetic field sensors. The major challenge, however,
    remains in isolating the system from background fields and stray radiations that
    can add noise in the measurement can cause decoherence of the quantum states.
    Similarly, spin systems can also be in the form of an ensemble in a negatively
    charged NV-centre in a diamond lattice [[61](#CR61)]. NV centres are crystal defects
    in an otherwise perfect diamond lattice. These defects are created by replacing
    one carbon atom with a nitrogen atom either by ion implantation, or via neutron
    or proton bombarding, and an adjacent vacancy that is created by irradiation or
    particle collisions. The material choice of nitrogen vacancy in diamond lattice
    is made such that the defect site is a colour centre that is photoluminescent
    and responds to both magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiations. The NV centre
    is intrinsically neutral, but can be charged negatively by applying external voltage
    to shift the Fermi level of the crystal. This results in two unpaired electrons
    in the centre that forms singlet and triplet states. The electronic structure
    of these unpaired electrons form mixed states that can then be used to respond
    to external magnetic fields, with a demonstrated sensitivity of 1 pT/![$$\sqrt{Hz}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq261.png).
    Thus, nanomagnet NV-centres can be combined with an AFM tip for imaging and metrology
    applications. Spins in NV-centres have additional applications as quantum bits
    due to their longer coherence times.

    total of six Nobel Prizes. The discovery of the Josephson effect in the early
    1960 led to the development of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)
    which has been widely used as a high-sensitivity magnetometer. With a noise floor
    of 3 fT/![$$\sqrt{Hz}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq265.png),

    at 100 Hz and 50 nm loop diameter [[72](#CR72)]. Further, the seminal work of
    Nakamura and Pashkin demonstrated coherent control of macroscopic quantum states
    in superconducting circuits in 1999 [[73](#CR73)] followed by demonstration of
    Rabi oscillations in 2001 [[74](#CR74)]. Since then, superconductivity has been
    implemented to realize circuit Quantum Electrodynamics by using macroscopic quantum
    states of an ensemble of cooper pair tunnelling through a Josephson Junction.
    These superconducting circuits are fabricated on a silicon chip, usually deposited
    with aluminium or niobium, where devices like SQUID, non-linear 2D electromagnetic
    resonators, single cooper pair box (SCB), superconducting nanowire single-photon
    detectors (SNSPD), etc. can be patterned. A superconducting (SC) qubit is basically
    an anharmonic LC oscillator, demonstrating macroscopic quantum behaviour due to
    Second Quantization of Cooper pairs tunnelling through the Josephson Junctions.
    Such SC qubits can be used as microwave signal analyser in the GHz regime, thereby
    acting as a VNA [[75](#CR75)]. Another research entangled an SC qubit to a ferrimagnetic
    crystal and detected an isolated magnetic wave packet (magnon) [[76](#CR76)].
    Quite recently, a new proposal claims that SC qubits can be used for detecting
    low mass bosonic dark matter particles like axions or hidden photons, via weak
    interactions with electromagnetic fields [[77](#CR77)] (Fig. [18](#Fig18)).![](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Fig18_HTML.png)

- en: Magnetically levitated superconducting (SC) particles promise to reach ultra-low
    mechanical dissipation [[44](#CR44)] due to the absence of clamping and internal
    material losses, which are otherwise limiting factors in clamped nanomechanical
    resonators, and the absence of photon recoil heating, a limiting factor in optical
    levitation experiments. The extreme isolation of these particles from the environment
    results in long coherence times of the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which
    is a requirement for generating quantum states. Furthermore, the magnetically
    levitated particle can be coupled via flux to superconducting circuits, which
    allows for quantum manipulation of its centre-of-mass (COM) motion. Thus, magnetically
    levitated particles are a promising novel platform for developing ultra-sensitive
    force and acceleration sensors, both in the classical [[79](#CR79)] and in the
    quantum regime. This ultra-sensitive platform is enabled by levitating SC micro
    particles using magnetic field traps at low temperatures. These traps have been
    realized on-chip to better facilitate the coupling of the SC particles to superconducting
    circuits to control them in the quantum regime [[80](#CR80)]. In order to bring
    the COM motion of the particle to its ground state of motion, feedback cooling
    or sideband cooling can be implemented. Feedback cooling can be implemented by
    using an on-chip SQUID magnetometer that will detect the position of the COM motion
    of the levitated particle. The signal from the SQUID can then be amplified and
    phase-shifted in order to be fed back to the magnetic trap so that it can cause
    parametric cooling of the levitated particle. Once the particle is in the ground
    state, it can be coupled to a superconducting circuit, such as a tunable non-linear
    LC resonator or a flux-qubit via magnetic flux. Ultimately, this coupling allows
    generation of quantum states of the COM motion, such as superposition or squeezed
    states, which can be used for sensing of ultra-low forces, e.g., gravity. This
    platform can be used to prepare a macroscopic quantum state of a particle on the
    scale of ![$$10^{13}$$](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Chapter_TeX_IEq268.png)
    a.m.u., which can be used to investigate the collapse model of quantum mechanics.
    Moreover, this platform has applications in both technology and fundamental physics.
    The enhanced sensitivity of such quantum states can be used build ultra-sensitive
    force and acceleration sensors for navigation, defense, and geospatial imaging.
    Since the force sensitivity predicted for such high quality resonators is in the
    order of zN, such levitating particles can be used to investigate the effect of
    gravity on quantum systems, and potentially for detecting dark matter candidates
    [[44](#CR44), [79](#CR79), [81](#CR81)] (Fig. [19](#Fig19)).![](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Fig19_HTML.png)

- en: Due to the quantum nature of these sensors, there are many challenges that must
    be overcome for developing commercial quantum sensors. One major and obvious challenge
    is to isolate the quantum system from external environment in order to have longer
    coherence times and lower measurement noise. However, this must be done without
    hampering the detection of the test signal or physical quantity to be measured.
    This poses a limitation on the noise isolation and eventually the sensitivity
    of the quantum sensor. For example, NV-centres are encased in magnetic shields
    like cryoperm or superconducting Niobium, as they are sensitive to any weak magnetic
    noise. However, the diamond lattice, which is the host for the centre, itself
    introduces magnetic field fluctuations due to random spin switching of the carbon
    nucleus. This stray field cannot be shielded and thus limits the coherence times
    of the quantum states. Further, quantum sensing platforms are heavily dependent
    on quantum material research. Philip Hemmer from Texas A &M University explains
    how dwindling of research funding in quantum materials affected the progress of
    NV-centre based quantum sensors in the United States [[82](#CR82)].

- en: Another major challenge in developing practical quantum sensors is scalability.
    Many quantum sensor implementation can be made more sensitive by increasing the
    number of quantum systems involved in the detection. For example, NV-centres and
    trapped ions are known to have excellent sensitivity when used in an ensemble
    of multiple spin systems. However, the scaling can pose a challenge due to various
    reasons, including but not limited to, the nature of trapping, material defects
    that scale with size, weakening of signal strength with distance (considerable
    in electromagnetic signal that scale inverse square with distance), entanglement
    of multiple quantum states, measurement noise that scales with number of detectors,
    size of cryogenics involved, etc. The last one is a major concern, not only for
    quantum sensors, but also for quantum computers, as most of them rely on some
    form of cryogenics for effective operation. Even systems like NV centre and trapped
    ions that works well at room temperature are demonstrated to have better performance
    at cryogenic temperatures (usually near 4 K) where the linewidth is fine enough
    to resolve the zero-phonon line (ZPL) [[83](#CR83), [84](#CR84)].

    sensors. For example, the need for a dilution refrigerator in case of Josephson
    Junction based devices poses a hurdle in implementing superconducting quantum
    sensors in space applications for dark matter detection. Another similar limitation
    is experienced in gravimetry sensors. Despite being extremely sensitive, these
    devices are relative gravimeters and thus needs to be periodically calibrated
    by an absolute gravimeter. In space applications, this implies a to-and-fro journey
    from space to earth, which costs both time and money. Similarly, for acceleration
    sensors involved in defence and navigation applications, miniaturization and portability
    is a commonly encountered limitation.

    exploring the frontiers of physics. SQUIDs and NV-centres are commonly used for
    magnetic field detection, Rydberg atoms are used for electric field detections,
    neutral atoms are used for measuring time, and atom interferometers and levitating
    systems are used for detecting gravitational force, inertial accelerations and
    rotations. However, recently, more diverse applications for quantum sensors are
    emerging, for example, renewable energy, dark matter detection, navigation and
    ranging, geophysics and astrophysics, biomedical and healthcare, chemistry and
    spectroscopy, to name a few. In order to realize these applications, different
    implementation techniques have been proposed. For example, sensing in the Zero
    Phonon Line (ZPL) results in a single narrow emission band for certain materials,
    which can then be used in NV-centres and 2D materials like hexa-Boron Nitride
    for high precision sensing of temperatures and electric fields. With optically
    detected magnetic resonance, similar to NV-centres, materials like Silicon Carbide
    and various rare earth metals can be used for temperature, pressure, strain, and
    electric and magnetic field sensing [[48](#CR48)]. Spin relaxometry in diamond
    centres can be used to detect magnetic ions and pH values in chemical industries

    begun gaining traction only in the past couple decades. It has shown to have a
    wide range of applications from fundamental physics to advanced engineering and
    metrology. Each implementation of quantum sensing has a unique advantage compared
    to their classical counterpart. Photon based systems have high sensitivity and
    low noise, and maximally squeezed light gives precision beyond the standard quantum
    limit. A major advantage of quantum sensors is flexibility in its implementation:
    a researcher can design their sensors for a detecting particular physical quantity,
    as well as devise them from a large range of materials and physical platforms
    like natural atoms, quantum dots, semiconducting and superconducting circuits
    and even macroscopic systems. This design flexibility can be used for developing
    quantum sensors that are immune to a specific type of force or energy scale that
    can act as a noise or disturbance in measuring the desired physical quantity.
    For example, using superconductivity can shield the system from weak stray magnetic
    fields. Similarly, levitating systems can isolate the quantum sensors from clamping
    losses and inter-atomic forces. Superconducting circuits can be used to develop
    atom-like two level systems that are of macroscopic size and thus more resilient

    in other quantum technologies like quantum computing, quantum communication and
    quantum materials. There are already a lot of efforts put and success achieved
    in quantum computing and communication, and this research can also be benefitted
    to develop better and diverse quantum sensors. For example, technologies of quantum
    dots and superconducting circuits are being used for sensing applications which
    were proposed quite recently. Similarly, advances in quantum sensing can also
    be used to solve problems in other areas of quantum technology. For example, trapped
    ions and NV-centres in diamond lattice were previously known only for their spectroscopy
    application and ultra-high sensitivities in measuring magnetic fields. However,
    being a good two-level system with long coherence times, both, trapped ions and
    NV-centres also found their way into quantum computing. Recently, NV-centres are
    proposed to be used to not be qubits for computing applications, but also for
    storage of quantum information. Similarly, levitating macroscopic particles can
    also be used for storing quantum information, although their use in quantum computing
    is yet to be explored. Additionally, research funding in one field can benefit
    multiple fields. For example, investment in better fabrication processes, cryogenics,
    and material development gives a huge boost to all areas of quantum technology
    and thus can prove to a powerful drive for collaborative projects or seeking research
    grants (Fig. [20](#Fig20)).![](../images/516210_1_En_2_Chapter/516210_1_En_2_Fig20_HTML.png)

    This will, in parallel, result in increase in supply chain and enabler industries

    a 2019 market report by Inside Quantum Technology, the global market for quantum
    sensors is expected to grow up to a billion USD in the coming decade [[86](#CR86)].
    Thus, it can be said that quantum sensors are still an emerging area posed with
    equal opportunities as well as challenges, but appearing to grow rapidly in its
    research and applications. As a result, the progress of quantum sensors in the
    coming years is posed to establish it as a major and crucial pillar of quantum
    technology.
