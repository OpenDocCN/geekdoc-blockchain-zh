- en: Blockchain technologies have received extensive attention recently due to its
    provision of a secure and decentralized resource-sharing manner. The blockchain
    has also driven a diversity of applications, such as digital currencies, sharing
    economy, e-payment, digital government, and data provenance. Moreover, smart contracts
    based on blockchains can automate business activities so as to reduce service
    costs and improve the efficiency of business process.

- en: Despite the merits of decentralization, immutability, non-repudiation, and traceability
    of the blockchain, the development of blockchain technology has undergone a number
    of challenges such as the difficulty of data analytics on encrypted blockchain
    data, poor scalability, software vulnerabilities of the blockchain, and scarcity
    of appropriate incentive mechanisms. The integration of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) with blockchain has the potentials to overcome the limitations of the blockchain.
    In particular, machine learning-based approaches may help to analyze the blockchain
    data and to identify the misbehaviors in blockchain. In addition, deep reinforcement
    learning methods can be used to improve the reliability of blockchain systems.

- en: The goal of this book concentrates on using AI to improve blockchain ecosystem.
    We name the intelligence bestowed by AI to blockchain as *blockchain intelligence*.
    The blockchain intelligence is essentially the integration of AI, big data analytics,
    and blockchain technologies. Gathering latest advances brought by AI in data analytics
    of blockchain data, this book also fosters the big data research on blockchain
    systems.

- en: This book describes data extraction, exploration, and analytics on representative
    blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also includes data analytics
    on smart contracts, misbehavior detection on blockchain data, and market analysis
    of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, this book also outlines future
    directions in blockchain intelligence. This book provides both researchers and
    practitioners with valuable insights into big data analytics of blockchain data,
    AI-enabled blockchain systems, and applications driven by blockchain intelligence.
