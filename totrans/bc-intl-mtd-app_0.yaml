- en: Blockchain technologies have received extensive attention recently due to its
    provision of a secure and decentralized resource-sharing manner. The blockchain
    has also driven a diversity of applications, such as digital currencies, sharing
    economy, e-payment, digital government, and data provenance. Moreover, smart contracts
    based on blockchains can automate business activities so as to reduce service
    costs and improve the efficiency of business process.

  zh: 近年来，由于其提供的安全和去中心化的资源共享方式，区块链技术受到了广泛的关注。区块链还推动了各种应用，如数字货币、共享经济、电子支付、数字政府和数据来源。此外，基于区块链的智能合约可以自动化商业活动，以降低服务成本并提高业务流程的效率。
- en: Despite the merits of decentralization, immutability, non-repudiation, and traceability
    of the blockchain, the development of blockchain technology has undergone a number
    of challenges such as the difficulty of data analytics on encrypted blockchain
    data, poor scalability, software vulnerabilities of the blockchain, and scarcity
    of appropriate incentive mechanisms. The integration of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) with blockchain has the potentials to overcome the limitations of the blockchain.
    In particular, machine learning-based approaches may help to analyze the blockchain
    data and to identify the misbehaviors in blockchain. In addition, deep reinforcement
    learning methods can be used to improve the reliability of blockchain systems.

  zh: 尽管区块链的分散性、不可篡改性、不可否认性和可追溯性有其优点，但区块链技术的发展经历了一系列挑战，如加密区块链数据的分析困难、可扩展性差、区块链的软件漏洞以及缺乏适当的激励机制。将人工智能（AI）与区块链集成有可能克服区块链的局限性。特别是，基于机器学习的方法可能有助于分析区块链数据并识别区块链中的异常行为。此外，深度强化学习方法可用于提高区块链系统的可靠性。
- en: The goal of this book concentrates on using AI to improve blockchain ecosystem.
    We name the intelligence bestowed by AI to blockchain as *blockchain intelligence*.
    The blockchain intelligence is essentially the integration of AI, big data analytics,
    and blockchain technologies. Gathering latest advances brought by AI in data analytics
    of blockchain data, this book also fosters the big data research on blockchain
    systems.

  zh: 本书的目标集中在利用AI改善区块链生态。我们将AI赋予区块链的智慧称为*区块链智能*。区块链智能本质上是AI、大数据分析和区块链技术的集成。收集AI在区块链数据分析方面带来的最新进展，本书还促进了区块链系统的大数据分析研究。
- en: This book describes data extraction, exploration, and analytics on representative
    blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also includes data analytics
    on smart contracts, misbehavior detection on blockchain data, and market analysis
    of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, this book also outlines future
    directions in blockchain intelligence. This book provides both researchers and
    practitioners with valuable insights into big data analytics of blockchain data,
    AI-enabled blockchain systems, and applications driven by blockchain intelligence.
