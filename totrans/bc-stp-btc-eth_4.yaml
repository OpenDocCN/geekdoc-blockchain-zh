- en: 'CHAPTER 4Ideal MoneyPeople adopt crypto-assets that have a specific function
    in their economic life, such as transacting, saving, speculating, or investing.
    In the previous chapter, we saw that crypto-assets that fulfill those financial
    and commercial functions catalyze a network effect, giving birth to a self-reinforcing
    cycle. In essence, the more people use the asset, the more liquid it becomes,
    which in turn boosts its usefulness and value, which leads to the price rising.
    This high price allows the network to absorb more transactions of higher value.
    Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new users, which makes
    the asset more liquid. The benefit of this feedback loop makes the cryptocurrency
    or asset a growing success.The features of a crypto-asset that catalyze a network
    effect fall into two broad categories:A) Financial choice —We can judge these
    as value propositions with features and benefits to a specific buyer persona.
    The users of the product or service get choices or options that are black and
    white; they make the transaction possible or not. The entrepreneurs who can invent
    these features apply the traditional insights into startups to the domain of finance.
    Most startup entrepreneurs are familiar with the finance industry as it was before
    Bitcoin, and therefore overlook money, financial assets, and transactions as areas
    where they can win. But now, entrepreneurs merely have to turn their heads to
    see the opportunities. Strict regulation of international banking makes many transfers
    slow or impossible. Any substantial sum becomes precarious. Regulators force international
    bankers to act as third-rate cops that ask annoying questions. From the perspective
    of the client, it looks like petty abuse of power. They can use cryptocurrency
    to evade such customer experiences.Another example of giving people financial
    choices: Crypto-assets that relieve a person’s tax burden would be in high demand.
    Perhaps you can make people’s income streams passive, moving them from income-taxed
    to capital gains tax. There are likely many opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
    of tax law. Wealthy people already do this, with the help of costly attorneys,
    who are middlemen of traditional law. In the future, entrepreneurs can use smart
    contract platforms to provide those services to anyone who feels that they pay
    too much tax.B) Low friction —One factor in the growth of the network effect is
    friction in the user experience of a crypto-asset. The resistance depends on,
    for example:•    How quickly can a user get on board?•    Does the user need technical
    knowledge?•    What is the learning curve for the typical user?•    Does the software
    evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model of the user?To apply an
    idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets that fulfill the
    benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the right thing, while
    crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are efficient : they
    do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first proves its effectiveness,
    and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin, users first needed to
    understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency. A critical mass
    of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could profit from
    building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy. Altcoins
    showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets got support
    from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency depends on
    the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software
    Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of
    “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because
    monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no
    one knew how to make all three of those properties digital, so money could not
    yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the
    surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking,
    and financial institutions have been using information technology since the IBM
    mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate one of the properties
    of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money
    around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally
    transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other two properties,
    trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and corporate nature
    of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your deposit; you had
    to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had to trust the central
    bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set interest rates. We had
    to trust the government to impose the exact right kind of regulation on these
    banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being replaced by the software
    was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender and cab driver.Since
    Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the money is being freed
    up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash, although the belief
    in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development. Cash payments
    can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees should be
    much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning
    Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his talks,
    crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this book,
    I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money? On the
    one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers corrupted
    the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,
    developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities that appear
    to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept the national
    fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under which circumstances
    would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency? Only when crypto-assets
    become as light as information and free of any medium. When your money is invisible
    to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money that moves like information but
    is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not be stopped or confiscated.When
    paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable and faster than anything else,
    and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere, anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs
    and developers to make new types of payments available. It is like predicting
    video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can see ‘the internet of money’ coming,
    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.Ideal MoneyPeople adopt crypto-assets that
    have a specific function in their economic life, such as transacting, saving,
    speculating, or investing. In the previous chapter, we saw that crypto-assets
    that fulfill those financial and commercial functions catalyze a network effect,
    giving birth to a self-reinforcing cycle. In essence, the more people use the

    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.People adopt crypto-assets that have a
    specific function in their economic life, such as transacting, saving, speculating,
    or investing. In the previous chapter, we saw that crypto-assets that fulfill
    those financial and commercial functions catalyze a network effect, giving birth
    to a self-reinforcing cycle. In essence, the more people use the asset, the more
    liquid it becomes, which in turn boosts its usefulness and value, which leads
    to the price rising. This high price allows the network to absorb more transactions
    of higher value. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, which makes the asset more liquid. The benefit of this feedback loop makes
    the cryptocurrency or asset a growing success.The features of a crypto-asset that
    catalyze a network effect fall into two broad categories:A) Financial choice —We
    can judge these as value propositions with features and benefits to a specific
    buyer persona. The users of the product or service get choices or options that
    are black and white; they make the transaction possible or not. The entrepreneurs
    who can invent these features apply the traditional insights into startups to
    the domain of finance. Most startup entrepreneurs are familiar with the finance
    industry as it was before Bitcoin, and therefore overlook money, financial assets,
    and transactions as areas where they can win. But now, entrepreneurs merely have
    to turn their heads to see the opportunities. Strict regulation of international
    banking makes many transfers slow or impossible. Any substantial sum becomes precarious.
    Regulators force international bankers to act as third-rate cops that ask annoying
    questions. From the perspective of the client, it looks like petty abuse of power.
    They can use cryptocurrency to evade such customer experiences.Another example
    of giving people financial choices: Crypto-assets that relieve a person’s tax
    burden would be in high demand. Perhaps you can make people’s income streams passive,
    moving them from income-taxed to capital gains tax. There are likely many opportunities
    for regulatory arbitrage of tax law. Wealthy people already do this, with the
    help of costly attorneys, who are middlemen of traditional law. In the future,
    entrepreneurs can use smart contract platforms to provide those services to anyone
    who feels that they pay too much tax.B) Low friction —One factor in the growth
    of the network effect is friction in the user experience of a crypto-asset. The
    resistance depends on, for example:•    How quickly can a user get on board?•    Does
    the user need technical knowledge?•    What is the learning curve for the typical
    user?•    Does the software evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model
    of the user?To apply an idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets
    that fulfill the benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the
    right thing, while crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are
    efficient : they do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first
    proves its effectiveness, and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin,
    users first needed to understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency.
    A critical mass of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could
    profit from building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy.
    Altcoins showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets
    got support from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency
    depends on the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software
    Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of
    “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because
    monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no
    one knew how to make all three of those properties digital, so money could not
    yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the
    surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking,
    and financial institutions have been using information technology since the IBM
    mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate one of the properties
    of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money
    around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally
    transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other two properties,
    trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and corporate nature
    of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your deposit; you had
    to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had to trust the central
    bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set interest rates. We had
    to trust the government to impose the exact right kind of regulation on these
    banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being replaced by the software
    was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender and cab driver.Since
    Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the money is being freed
    up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash, although the belief
    in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development. Cash payments
    can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees should be
    much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning
    Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his talks,
    crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this book,
    I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money? On the
    one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers corrupted
    the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,
    developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities that appear
    to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept the national
    fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under which circumstances
    would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency? Only when crypto-assets
    become as light as information and free of any medium. When your money is invisible
    to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money that moves like information but
    is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not be stopped or confiscated.When
    paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable and faster than anything else,
    and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere, anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs
    and developers to make new types of payments available. It is like predicting
    video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can see ‘the internet of money’ coming,
    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can

    finally entered the age of information.The features of a crypto-asset that catalyze
    a network effect fall into two broad categories:A) Financial choice —We can judge
    these as value propositions with features and benefits to a specific buyer persona.
    The users of the product or service get choices or options that are black and
    white; they make the transaction possible or not. The entrepreneurs who can invent
    these features apply the traditional insights into startups to the domain of finance.
    Most startup entrepreneurs are familiar with the finance industry as it was before
    Bitcoin, and therefore overlook money, financial assets, and transactions as areas
    where they can win. But now, entrepreneurs merely have to turn their heads to
    see the opportunities. Strict regulation of international banking makes many transfers
    slow or impossible. Any substantial sum becomes precarious. Regulators force international
    bankers to act as third-rate cops that ask annoying questions. From the perspective
    of the client, it looks like petty abuse of power. They can use cryptocurrency
    to evade such customer experiences.Another example of giving people financial
    choices: Crypto-assets that relieve a person’s tax burden would be in high demand.
    Perhaps you can make people’s income streams passive, moving them from income-taxed
    to capital gains tax. There are likely many opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
    of tax law. Wealthy people already do this, with the help of costly attorneys,
    who are middlemen of traditional law. In the future, entrepreneurs can use smart
    contract platforms to provide those services to anyone who feels that they pay
    too much tax.B) Low friction —One factor in the growth of the network effect is
    friction in the user experience of a crypto-asset. The resistance depends on,
    for example:•    How quickly can a user get on board?•    Does the user need technical
    knowledge?•    What is the learning curve for the typical user?•    Does the software
    evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model of the user?To apply an
    idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets that fulfill the
    benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the right thing, while
    crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are efficient : they
    do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first proves its effectiveness,
    and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin, users first needed to
    understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency. A critical mass
    of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could profit from
    building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy. Altcoins
    showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets got support
    from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency depends on
    the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software
    Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of
    “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because
    monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no
    one knew how to make all three of those properties digital, so money could not
    yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the
    surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking,
    and financial institutions have been using information technology since the IBM
    mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate one of the properties
    of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money
    around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally
    transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other two properties,
    trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and corporate nature
    of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your deposit; you had
    to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had to trust the central
    bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set interest rates. We had
    to trust the government to impose the exact right kind of regulation on these
    banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being replaced by the software
    was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender and cab driver.Since
    Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the money is being freed
    up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash, although the belief
    in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development. Cash payments
    can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees should be
    much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning
    Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his talks,
    crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this book,
    I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money? On the
    one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers corrupted
    the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,
    developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities that appear
    to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept the national
    fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under which circumstances
    would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency? Only when crypto-assets
    become as light as information and free of any medium. When your money is invisible
    to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money that moves like information but
    is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not be stopped or confiscated.When
    paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable and faster than anything else,
    and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere, anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs
    and developers to make new types of payments available. It is like predicting
    video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can see ‘the internet of money’ coming,
    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.A) Financial choice —We can judge these
    as value propositions with features and benefits to a specific buyer persona.
    The users of the product or service get choices or options that are black and
    white; they make the transaction possible or not. The entrepreneurs who can invent
    these features apply the traditional insights into startups to the domain of finance.
    Most startup entrepreneurs are familiar with the finance industry as it was before
    Bitcoin, and therefore overlook money, financial assets, and transactions as areas
    where they can win. But now, entrepreneurs merely have to turn their heads to
    see the opportunities. Strict regulation of international banking makes many transfers
    slow or impossible. Any substantial sum becomes precarious. Regulators force international
    bankers to act as third-rate cops that ask annoying questions. From the perspective
    of the client, it looks like petty abuse of power. They can use cryptocurrency
    to evade such customer experiences.Another example of giving people financial
    choices: Crypto-assets that relieve a person’s tax burden would be in high demand.
    Perhaps you can make people’s income streams passive, moving them from income-taxed
    to capital gains tax. There are likely many opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
    of tax law. Wealthy people already do this, with the help of costly attorneys,
    who are middlemen of traditional law. In the future, entrepreneurs can use smart
    contract platforms to provide those services to anyone who feels that they pay
    too much tax.B) Low friction —One factor in the growth of the network effect is
    friction in the user experience of a crypto-asset. The resistance depends on,
    for example:•    How quickly can a user get on board?•    Does the user need technical
    knowledge?•    What is the learning curve for the typical user?•    Does the software
    evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model of the user?To apply an
    idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets that fulfill the
    benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the right thing, while
    crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are efficient : they
    do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first proves its effectiveness,
    and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin, users first needed to
    understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency. A critical mass
    of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could profit from
    building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy. Altcoins
    showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets got support
    from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency depends on
    the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software

    “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because

    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they

    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as

    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.Another example of giving people financial
    choices: Crypto-assets that relieve a person’s tax burden would be in high demand.
    Perhaps you can make people’s income streams passive, moving them from income-taxed
    to capital gains tax. There are likely many opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
    of tax law. Wealthy people already do this, with the help of costly attorneys,
    who are middlemen of traditional law. In the future, entrepreneurs can use smart
    contract platforms to provide those services to anyone who feels that they pay
    too much tax.B) Low friction —One factor in the growth of the network effect is
    friction in the user experience of a crypto-asset. The resistance depends on,
    for example:•    How quickly can a user get on board?•    Does the user need technical
    knowledge?•    What is the learning curve for the typical user?•    Does the software
    evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model of the user?To apply an
    idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets that fulfill the
    benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the right thing, while
    crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are efficient : they
    do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first proves its effectiveness,
    and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin, users first needed to
    understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency. A critical mass
    of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could profit from
    building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy. Altcoins
    showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets got support
    from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency depends on
    the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software
    Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of
    “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because
    monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no
    one knew how to make all three of those properties digital, so money could not
    yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the
    surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking,
    and financial institutions have been using information technology since the IBM
    mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate one of the properties
    of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money
    around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally
    transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other two properties,
    trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and corporate nature
    of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your deposit; you had
    to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had to trust the central
    bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set interest rates. We had
    to trust the government to impose the exact right kind of regulation on these
    banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being replaced by the software
    was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender and cab driver.Since
    Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the money is being freed
    up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash, although the belief
    in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development. Cash payments
    can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees should be
    much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning
    Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his talks,
    crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this book,
    I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money? On the
    one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers corrupted
    the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,
    developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities that appear
    to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept the national
    fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under which circumstances
    would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency? Only when crypto-assets
    become as light as information and free of any medium. When your money is invisible
    to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money that moves like information but
    is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not be stopped or confiscated.When
    paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable and faster than anything else,
    and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere, anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs
    and developers to make new types of payments available. It is like predicting
    video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can see ‘the internet of money’ coming,
    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion

    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible

    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.•    How quickly can a user get on board?•    Does
    the user need technical knowledge?•    What is the learning curve for the typical
    user?•    Does the software evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model
    of the user?To apply an idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets
    that fulfill the benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the
    right thing, while crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are
    efficient : they do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first
    proves its effectiveness, and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin,
    users first needed to understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency.
    A critical mass of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could
    profit from building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy.
    Altcoins showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets
    got support from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency
    depends on the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software
    Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of
    “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because
    monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no
    one knew how to make all three of those properties digital, so money could not
    yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the
    surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking,
    and financial institutions have been using information technology since the IBM
    mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate one of the properties
    of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money
    around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally
    transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other two properties,
    trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and corporate nature
    of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your deposit; you had
    to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had to trust the central
    bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set interest rates. We had
    to trust the government to impose the exact right kind of regulation on these
    banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being replaced by the software
    was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender and cab driver.Since
    Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the money is being freed
    up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash, although the belief
    in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development. Cash payments
    can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees should be
    much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning
    Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his talks,
    crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this book,
    I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money? On the
    one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers corrupted
    the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,
    developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities that appear
    to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept the national
    fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under which circumstances
    would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency? Only when crypto-assets
    become as light as information and free of any medium. When your money is invisible
    to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money that moves like information but
    is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not be stopped or confiscated.When
    paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable and faster than anything else,
    and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere, anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs
    and developers to make new types of payments available. It is like predicting
    video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can see ‘the internet of money’ coming,
    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per

    into the medium’s limited economics.Some examples:•    You took pictures in sets
    of 36 and could see them, after “development,” a week later.•    TV and radio
    are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for one-to-one, and talking to people
    further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper informs the opinions within
    a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three good songs, but you pay for
    all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication
    became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud
    computing finished the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs
    discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that
    was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because monetary media
    have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to
    make all three of those properties digital, so money could not yet become as light
    as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online
    with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking, and financial institutions
    have been using information technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization
    only had software liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike
    cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money around like information, like
    the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the
    first step. However, the other two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still
    depended on the physical and corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee
    the accuracy of your deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly.
    Furthermore, we had to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount
    of money and to set interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the
    exact right kind of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most
    resistant to being replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for
    paying the bartender and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and
    desirability of the money is being freed up by software too. That includes the
    function of fiat cash, although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash
    is still in development. Cash payments can become digital when transactions are
    practically free. The fees should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going
    to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital
    money wins. In one of his talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it
    “streaming money.” In this book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want
    to use fully digital money? On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations,
    people whose rulers corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies.
    On the other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.•    What is the learning curve for the typical user?•    Does
    the software evoke the right metaphors to support the mental model of the user?To
    apply an idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets that fulfill
    the benefit of transacting and holding are effective : they do the right thing,
    while crypto-assets that make these transactions quick and easy are efficient
    : they do ‘the thing’ right. We see that a specific crypto-asset first proves
    its effectiveness, and then becomes more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin, users
    first needed to understand the notion of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency.
    A critical mass of enthusiasts had to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could
    profit from building exchanges and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy.
    Altcoins showed a similar development, where the more successful crypto-assets
    got support from exchanges and wallets. The network effect of a cryptocurrency
    depends on the usefulness first: it has to empower a new type of transaction effectively.
    The currency or asset needs a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started.
    Once the users can fulfill their transaction needs in this new way, they can care
    about its efficiency. The transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are
    nice-to- haves.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness
    with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and
    Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments or mobile
    applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes
    in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the new type of
    transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has no reason for
    existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling convenient
    payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is a necessary
    condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology for making
    transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on
    top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels between them
    that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then only the final
    balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining
    a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning
    Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not
    need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase
    such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do
    not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription
    services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is
    more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol is like the difference
    between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is
    slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court case. The transacting
    parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract.
    Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer will usually work fine, and only
    if a dispute does occur, does either party need the forced on-chain transaction
    to settle the balance.The second layer will free the media of money in the same
    way that internet protocols free information and communication from their traditional
    carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data,
    and publishers had to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some
    examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,”
    a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for
    one-to-one, and talking to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper
    informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three
    good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With
    tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones,
    tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away from specific media. Information
    flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software

    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes

    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health

    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad

    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.•    Does the software evoke the right
    metaphors to support the mental model of the user?To apply an idea by consultant
    and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets that fulfill the benefit of transacting
    and holding are effective : they do the right thing, while crypto-assets that
    make these transactions quick and easy are efficient : they do ‘the thing’ right.
    We see that a specific crypto-asset first proves its effectiveness, and then becomes
    more efficient. In the case of Bitcoin, users first needed to understand the notion
    of a digital, scare, unstoppable currency. A critical mass of enthusiasts had
    to want it badly, and then entrepreneurs could profit from building exchanges
    and wallets that made using Bitcoin fast and easy. Altcoins showed a similar development,
    where the more successful crypto-assets got support from exchanges and wallets.
    The network effect of a cryptocurrency depends on the usefulness first: it has
    to empower a new type of transaction effectively. The currency or asset needs
    a reason to exist to get the feedback loop started. Once the users can fulfill
    their transaction needs in this new way, they can care about its efficiency. The
    transaction is a must-have; its speed and comfort are nice-to- haves.Many of the
    founders of altcoins confuse monetary effectiveness with payment efficiency. They
    compare the speed and ease-of-use of Bitcoin and Ethereum to centralized networks
    such as regular credit card payments or mobile applications of banks. These projects
    try to launch a cryptocurrency that competes in efficiency with fiat payment networks,
    without introducing the new type of transaction. However, there is no point in
    printing money that has no reason for existing. For now, digital fiat is doing
    an excellent job handling convenient payments. The novel use case, which unlocks
    new economic value, is a necessary condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne
    promising technology for making transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper
    is a second protocol layer, on top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes
    to open channels between them that keep the transactions open until they close
    the channel. Then only the final balance is settled on the base layer. That will
    remove the need for maintaining a public and distributed record for small transactions.
    Protocols such as Lightning Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin.
    For example, the users do not need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small
    payment. A retail purchase such as coffee is not significant enough to record
    on the base layer of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on
    a higher tier. Also, you do not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies,
    such as retailers and subscription services, have customers who come back regularly,
    so an open payment channel is more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer
    protocol is like the difference between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap,
    and a court case, which is slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the
    court case. The transacting parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely
    event not covered by the contract. Likewise, the smart contract on the second
    layer will usually work fine, and only if a dispute does occur, does either party
    need the forced on-chain transaction to settle the balance.The second layer will
    free the media of money in the same way that internet protocols free information
    and communication from their traditional carriers. In the old days, we had channels
    and “media” to hold and transmit data, and publishers had to squeeze the message
    into the medium’s limited economics.Some examples:•    You took pictures in sets
    of 36 and could see them, after “development,” a week later.•    TV and radio
    are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for one-to-one, and talking to people
    further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper informs the opinions within
    a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three good songs, but you pay for
    all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication
    became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud
    computing finished the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs
    discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that
    was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because monetary media
    have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to
    make all three of those properties digital, so money could not yet become as light
    as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online
    with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking, and financial institutions
    have been using information technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization
    only had software liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike
    cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money around like information, like
    the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the
    first step. However, the other two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still
    depended on the physical and corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee
    the accuracy of your deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly.
    Furthermore, we had to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount
    of money and to set interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the
    exact right kind of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most
    resistant to being replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for
    paying the bartender and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and
    desirability of the money is being freed up by software too. That includes the
    function of fiat cash, although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash
    is still in development. Cash payments can become digital when transactions are
    practically free. The fees should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going
    to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital
    money wins. In one of his talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it
    “streaming money.” In this book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want
    to use fully digital money? On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations,
    people whose rulers corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies.
    On the other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.To apply an idea by consultant and educator Peter Drucker, crypto-assets

    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription

    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of

    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the

    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make

    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.Many of the founders of altcoins confuse
    monetary effectiveness with payment efficiency. They compare the speed and ease-of-use
    of Bitcoin and Ethereum to centralized networks such as regular credit card payments
    or mobile applications of banks. These projects try to launch a cryptocurrency
    that competes in efficiency with fiat payment networks, without introducing the
    new type of transaction. However, there is no point in printing money that has
    no reason for existing. For now, digital fiat is doing an excellent job handling
    convenient payments. The novel use case, which unlocks new economic value, is
    a necessary condition for success.Building the Higher LayersOne promising technology
    for making transactions on a blockchain faster and cheaper is a second protocol
    layer, on top of the base network. The protocol allows nodes to open channels
    between them that keep the transactions open until they close the channel. Then
    only the final balance is settled on the base layer. That will remove the need
    for maintaining a public and distributed record for small transactions. Protocols
    such as Lightning Network can ‘modulate’ the features of a bitcoin. For example,
    the users do not need to pay for hard guarantees if they make a small payment.
    A retail purchase such as coffee is not significant enough to record on the base
    layer of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The system should aggregate these on a higher tier.
    Also, you do not have to settle the balance daily. Many companies, such as retailers
    and subscription services, have customers who come back regularly, so an open
    payment channel is more efficient.The efficiency of the second layer protocol
    is like the difference between a paper contract, which is fast and cheap, and
    a court case, which is slow and expensive. A well-defined deal prevents the court
    case. The transacting parties only need judges for the rare and unlikely event
    not covered by the contract. Likewise, the smart contract on the second layer
    will usually work fine, and only if a dispute does occur, does either party need
    the forced on-chain transaction to settle the balance.The second layer will free
    the media of money in the same way that internet protocols free information and
    communication from their traditional carriers. In the old days, we had channels
    and “media” to hold and transmit data, and publishers had to squeeze the message
    into the medium’s limited economics.Some examples:•    You took pictures in sets
    of 36 and could see them, after “development,” a week later.•    TV and radio
    are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for one-to-one, and talking to people
    further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper informs the opinions within
    a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three good songs, but you pay for
    all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication
    became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud
    computing finished the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs
    discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that
    was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because monetary media
    have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to
    make all three of those properties digital, so money could not yet become as light
    as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online
    with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking, and financial institutions
    have been using information technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization
    only had software liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike
    cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money around like information, like
    the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the
    first step. However, the other two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still
    depended on the physical and corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee
    the accuracy of your deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly.
    Furthermore, we had to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount
    of money and to set interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the
    exact right kind of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most
    resistant to being replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for
    paying the bartender and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and
    desirability of the money is being freed up by software too. That includes the
    function of fiat cash, although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash
    is still in development. Cash payments can become digital when transactions are
    practically free. The fees should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going
    to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital
    money wins. In one of his talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it
    “streaming money.” In this book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want
    to use fully digital money? On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations,
    people whose rulers corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies.
    On the other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.

    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.One promising technology for making transactions on a blockchain
    faster and cheaper is a second protocol layer, on top of the base network. The
    protocol allows nodes to open channels between them that keep the transactions
    open until they close the channel. Then only the final balance is settled on the
    base layer. That will remove the need for maintaining a public and distributed
    record for small transactions. Protocols such as Lightning Network can ‘modulate’
    the features of a bitcoin. For example, the users do not need to pay for hard
    guarantees if they make a small payment. A retail purchase such as coffee is not
    significant enough to record on the base layer of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The system
    should aggregate these on a higher tier. Also, you do not have to settle the balance
    daily. Many companies, such as retailers and subscription services, have customers
    who come back regularly, so an open payment channel is more efficient.The efficiency
    of the second layer protocol is like the difference between a paper contract,
    which is fast and cheap, and a court case, which is slow and expensive. A well-defined
    deal prevents the court case. The transacting parties only need judges for the
    rare and unlikely event not covered by the contract. Likewise, the smart contract
    on the second layer will usually work fine, and only if a dispute does occur,
    does either party need the forced on-chain transaction to settle the balance.The
    second layer will free the media of money in the same way that internet protocols
    free information and communication from their traditional carriers. In the old
    days, we had channels and “media” to hold and transmit data, and publishers had
    to squeeze the message into the medium’s limited economics.Some examples:•    You
    took pictures in sets of 36 and could see them, after “development,” a week later.•    TV
    and radio are uniform and passive.•    A telephone is for one-to-one, and talking
    to people further away was more expensive.•    The newspaper informs the opinions
    within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three good songs, but you
    pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication
    became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud
    computing finished the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs
    discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that
    was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because monetary media
    have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to
    make all three of those properties digital, so money could not yet become as light
    as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online
    with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking, and financial institutions
    have been using information technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization
    only had software liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike
    cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money around like information, like
    the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the
    first step. However, the other two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still
    depended on the physical and corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee
    the accuracy of your deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly.
    Furthermore, we had to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount
    of money and to set interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the
    exact right kind of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most
    resistant to being replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for
    paying the bartender and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and
    desirability of the money is being freed up by software too. That includes the
    function of fiat cash, although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash
    is still in development. Cash payments can become digital when transactions are
    practically free. The fees should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going
    to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital
    money wins. In one of his talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it
    “streaming money.” In this book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want
    to use fully digital money? On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations,
    people whose rulers corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies.
    On the other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three

    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart

    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.The second layer will free the media of
    money in the same way that internet protocols free information and communication
    from their traditional carriers. In the old days, we had channels and “media”
    to hold and transmit data, and publishers had to squeeze the message into the
    medium’s limited economics.Some examples:•    You took pictures in sets of 36
    and could see them, after “development,” a week later.•    TV and radio are uniform
    and passive.•    A telephone is for one-to-one, and talking to people further
    away was more expensive.•    The newspaper informs the opinions within a nation.•    Compact
    discs (CDs) had two or three good songs, but you pay for all of them.•    Private
    video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication became easy, cheap, and
    frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud computing finished
    the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many,
    many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters
    1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that was a lot harder to free
    from its media: money. That is because monetary media have to be scarce, portable,
    and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to make all three of those properties
    digital, so money could not yet become as light as information. Money had been
    digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal,
    you do online banking, and financial institutions have been using information
    technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization only had software
    liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds,
    a bank can move fiat money around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century
    media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other
    two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and
    corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your
    deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had
    to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set
    interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the exact right kind
    of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being
    replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender
    and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the
    money is being freed up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash,
    although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development.
    Cash payments can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees
    should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever
    Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his
    talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this
    book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money?
    On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers
    corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the
    other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the

    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money

    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,

    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age

    The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud computing finished the move away
    from specific media. Information flows lightly one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many,
    and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there
    was one particular kind of “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media:
    money. That is because monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy.
    Up until 2008, no one knew how to make all three of those properties digital,
    so money could not yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized,
    but only at the surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you
    do online banking, and financial institutions have been using information technology
    since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate
    one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a
    bank can move fiat money around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century
    media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other
    two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and
    corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your
    deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had
    to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set
    interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the exact right kind
    of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being
    replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender
    and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the
    money is being freed up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash,
    although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development.
    Cash payments can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees
    should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever
    Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his
    talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this
    book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money?
    On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers
    corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the
    other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money

    one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers corrupted
    the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the other hand,
    developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities that appear
    to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept the national
    fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under which circumstances
    would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency? Only when crypto-assets
    become as light as information and free of any medium. When your money is invisible
    to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money that moves like information but
    is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not be stopped or confiscated.When
    paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable and faster than anything else,
    and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere, anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs
    and developers to make new types of payments available. It is like predicting
    video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can see ‘the internet of money’ coming,
    but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google of contracts’ are probably not imaginable
    from where we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.•    The newspaper informs the opinions
    within a nation.•    Compact discs (CDs) had two or three good songs, but you
    pay for all of them.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication
    became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud
    computing finished the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs
    discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that
    was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because monetary media
    have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to
    make all three of those properties digital, so money could not yet become as light
    as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online
    with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking, and financial institutions
    have been using information technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization
    only had software liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike
    cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money around like information, like
    the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the
    first step. However, the other two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still
    depended on the physical and corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee
    the accuracy of your deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly.
    Furthermore, we had to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount
    of money and to set interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the
    exact right kind of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most
    resistant to being replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for
    paying the bartender and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and
    desirability of the money is being freed up by software too. That includes the
    function of fiat cash, although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash
    is still in development. Cash payments can become digital when transactions are
    practically free. The fees should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going
    to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital
    money wins. In one of his talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it
    “streaming money.” In this book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want
    to use fully digital money? On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations,
    people whose rulers corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies.
    On the other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities

    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.•    Private video recordings were scarce.With tablets, communication
    became easy, cheap, and frictionless. The trend of smartphones, tablets, and cloud
    computing finished the move away from specific media. Information flows lightly
    one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one.How Software Frees MoneyAs
    discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there was one particular kind of “message” that
    was a lot harder to free from its media: money. That is because monetary media
    have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy. Up until 2008, no one knew how to
    make all three of those properties digital, so money could not yet become as light
    as information. Money had been digitized, but only at the surface. You pay online
    with your credit card and PayPal, you do online banking, and financial institutions
    have been using information technology since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization
    only had software liberate one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike
    cash, gold, or diamonds, a bank can move fiat money around like information, like
    the “messages” of 20th-century media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the
    first step. However, the other two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still
    depended on the physical and corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee
    the accuracy of your deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly.
    Furthermore, we had to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount
    of money and to set interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the
    exact right kind of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most
    resistant to being replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for
    paying the bartender and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and
    desirability of the money is being freed up by software too. That includes the
    function of fiat cash, although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash
    is still in development. Cash payments can become digital when transactions are
    practically free. The fees should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going
    to an ATM or ADM. Wherever Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital
    money wins. In one of his talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it
    “streaming money.” In this book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want
    to use fully digital money? On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations,
    people whose rulers corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies.
    On the other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including

    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.How Software Frees MoneyAs discussed in chapters 1 and 2, there
    was one particular kind of “message” that was a lot harder to free from its media:
    money. That is because monetary media have to be scarce, portable, and trustworthy.
    Up until 2008, no one knew how to make all three of those properties digital,
    so money could not yet become as light as information. Money had been digitized,
    but only at the surface. You pay online with your credit card and PayPal, you
    do online banking, and financial institutions have been using information technology
    since the IBM mainframe. This step of digitization only had software liberate
    one of the properties of money: portability. Unlike cash, gold, or diamonds, a
    bank can move fiat money around like information, like the “messages” of 20th-century
    media. Digitally transporting fiat money was the first step. However, the other
    two properties, trustworthiness and scarcity, still depended on the physical and
    corporate nature of authority. The bank had to guarantee the accuracy of your
    deposit; you had to trust them to keep the books correctly. Furthermore, we had
    to trust the central bank to create the exact right amount of money and to set
    interest rates. We had to trust the government to impose the exact right kind
    of regulation on these banks. Finally, the money medium most resistant to being
    replaced by the software was cash—the banknotes and coins for paying the bartender
    and cab driver.Since Bitcoin, the trust in the rarity and desirability of the
    money is being freed up by software too. That includes the function of fiat cash,
    although the belief in and value of cryptocurrency as cash is still in development.
    Cash payments can become digital when transactions are practically free. The fees
    should be much lower than the opportunity cost of going to an ATM or ADM. Wherever
    Lightning Network technology is adopted, fully digital money wins. In one of his
    talks, crypto-educator Andreas Antonopoulos calls it “streaming money.” In this
    book, I refer to it as ideal money .Who would want to use fully digital money?
    On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers
    corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the
    other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our
    current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly
    or yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target

    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace

    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource

    we are now. We can only intuit the possible and prepare for the opportunities.
    Here are some examples from our current vantage point.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per
    SecondPresent situation: A monthly or yearly subscription, like the newspaper,
    gym membership, salary, club membership, and tuition is paid this way because
    the bank transfers the money in chunks. We calculate the cost relative to our
    income, budget, or credit card balance. The seller also benefits from the subscription
    model: newspapers or gyms recover the onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month
    minimum.Future situation: Your gym membership is one smart contract that defines
    a stream of money from your wallet to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That
    means you only have to make two decisions: sign up, use the gym, and close the
    stream when you no longer want to use the gym. You do have to think a bit before
    you start because the flow of money is not constant: it begins at a high rate
    per minute, let’s say the equivalent of a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means
    about 0.014 cents per minute. Over, say, ten days, the stream slows down to the
    “1-month membership”, $90 per month, or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute.
    The rate per minute continues to drop to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership
    lasts for six months. It will settle there forever until you end the contract.This
    type of contract also changes the power dynamic with clients who keep service
    providers on a retainer. The convention of transferring the money each month makes
    this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either the client has not yet gotten what they
    paid for, or the service provider is taking on debtors risk. These business relationships
    require trust. However, now you can trust the contract that controls the money
    stream, so a broader range of client-provider relationships opens up.Note that
    the mental effort is little. People already understand memberships; they know
    that the service company wants to reward their loyalty. Instead of a table of
    options, you see the graph of money per second going down with the length of the
    contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become a selling point. I can
    imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have gotten used to smartphone
    specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a sense of how a smart contract
    for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we will have a new vocabulary for
    money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation: Water, electricity, gas, and
    taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables: there is the ‘starting
    fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and time of use. Taking
    a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree on a fixed price,
    sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications such as
    Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that agreement.Future
    situation: The contract can become even smarter by including GPS data of the route—that
    protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who take a detour. As always,
    incentives are everything.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription
    plan can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more
    for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their
    own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives explain the challenges
    of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from
    patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell
    their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three stakeholders in
    their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their premium in real-time
    and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart contracts based on
    paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients, easy-going doctors
    and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy hospital owners.5\.
    Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed price of a ticket for
    public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants analyzing the cost structure
    and setting a price for some time. That is smart enough for the standard ride.
    However, some trips are not standard. The weather causes flight delays. The railroad
    track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted because of road construction.
    In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune and will regret their
    purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another means of transportation
    next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get their money back in proportion
    to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the brand name Fizzy, is already
    using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance for late flights. The contract
    is still crude: if the plane was two hours late, you get a refund. However, we
    can expect a rising level of granularity of the data for right-pricing tickets.All
    prices per unit can become ideal money so that the figure in your wallet application
    will move at various speeds in either direction.6\. Paying for AttentionThe proven
    way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online advertising has become
    granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions become possible
    between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges can start
    flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to review an
    offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do not have
    to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this model.
    As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing attention.
    For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription plan. That
    saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product purchase
    into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as these can
    turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with ideal money
    become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial decisions to
    computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent as a result.
    These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think about money
    that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer needs a specific
    medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that is, the cost of reproducing
    the story or information has nothing to do with the number of people viewing it.
    That means you can no longer charge for delivering your content to your audience;
    the free reproduction makes the material so abundant that any charging for content
    becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to charge for convenience and curation.
    With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller
    charges so little that most people do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction
    information, online companies sell the content as part of a journey with a new
    identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com.
    Paying for the content is pitched as a logical step in the journey. When sold
    at the right price, enough people will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future
    situation: Content creators can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble
    on their audience. For example, when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners
    to get business success, you get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon
    or Shopify. Ideal money will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and
    gurus that it can replace traditional education and credentials.The progress of
    the Lightning Network implies that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency
    to become available gradually, as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can
    now assume a future where most payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck
    is the size and growth of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These
    examples show that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables
    new value propositions by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has
    finally entered the age of information.Who would want to use fully digital money?
    On the one hand, we know that in many developing nations, people whose rulers
    corrupted the financial system are ready to switch to cryptocurrencies. On the
    other hand, developed countries have the luxury of trusting monetary authorities
    that appear to be good stewards of the fiat currency. Most people will accept
    the national fiat cash as payment and trust their bank to keep it safe. Under
    which circumstances would stable liberal democracies also adopt cryptocurrency?
    Only when crypto-assets become as light as information and free of any medium.
    When your money is invisible to anyone but you and whom you are paying. Money
    that moves like information but is as hard to create as gold. Money that can not
    be stopped or confiscated.When paying with cryptocurrency is more comfortable
    and faster than anything else, and it is sound money that we can stream anywhere,
    anytime, it is up to entrepreneurs and developers to make new types of payments
    available. It is like predicting video conferencing and e-books in 1994: We can
    see ‘the internet of money’ coming, but the ‘Facebook of finance’ or the ‘Google
    of contracts’ are probably not imaginable from where we are now. We can only intuit
    the possible and prepare for the opportunities. Here are some examples from our

    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.1\. Pay Subscriptions Per SecondPresent situation: A monthly or
    yearly subscription, like the newspaper, gym membership, salary, club membership,
    and tuition is paid this way because the bank transfers the money in chunks. We
    calculate the cost relative to our income, budget, or credit card balance. The
    seller also benefits from the subscription model: newspapers or gyms recover the
    onboarding cost when you commit to a 3-month minimum.Future situation: Your gym
    membership is one smart contract that defines a stream of money from your wallet
    to the gym. You can cancel at any time. That means you only have to make two decisions:
    sign up, use the gym, and close the stream when you no longer want to use the
    gym. You do have to think a bit before you start because the flow of money is
    not constant: it begins at a high rate per minute, let’s say the equivalent of
    a $20-day pass. To your wallet, that means about 0.014 cents per minute. Over,
    say, ten days, the stream slows down to the “1-month membership”, $90 per month,
    or $3 per day, or 0.002 cents per minute. The rate per minute continues to drop
    to about 0.001 cents by the time your membership lasts for six months. It will
    settle there forever until you end the contract.This type of contract also changes
    the power dynamic with clients who keep service providers on a retainer. The convention
    of transferring the money each month makes this deal ‘unfair’ by default. Either
    the client has not yet gotten what they paid for, or the service provider is taking
    on debtors risk. These business relationships require trust. However, now you
    can trust the contract that controls the money stream, so a broader range of client-provider
    relationships opens up.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users
    can tweak their preferences. By setting an upper limit for prices, the user can
    overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\. Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf
    an appointment is considered a strict agreement between the participants, then
    the wallet can talk to a shared calendar application and GPS locations. The people
    in the meeting can no longer make excuses about lateness and cancelations. Jobs
    that are not easy to define in terms of time and deliverables can have contracts
    that start the meter whenever the client and consultant are together at a designated
    GPS location. Any day this happens, the money stream includes a minimum amount
    for travel time and cost. Alternatively, a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps
    the client caring about moving their part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart
    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show

    Healthcare ContractsPeople that have a high-grade healthcare plan already know
    what this is like: you see the doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out
    the door. That is because health insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract.
    Insurance companies make deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart
    contracts of ideal money are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation:
    Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of
    healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it
    just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they
    manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums
    but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying
    treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative
    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.Note that the mental effort is little. People already understand
    memberships; they know that the service company wants to reward their loyalty.
    Instead of a table of options, you see the graph of money per second going down
    with the length of the contract. That way, a steep descending graph might become
    a selling point. I can imagine that we will get used to those graphs, as we have
    gotten used to smartphone specifications and road signs. Soon, we could have a
    sense of how a smart contract for a money stream is supposed to look. Then we
    will have a new vocabulary for money.2\. New Metered CommoditiesPresent situation:
    Water, electricity, gas, and taxi rides are charged per unit. There are two variables:
    there is the ‘starting fee’ and then a constant rate for a resource consumed and
    time of use. Taking a cab is different from place to place: sometimes you agree
    on a fixed price, sometimes you rely on the meter to be fair about it. With applications
    such as Uber and Lyft, you can send your money to the driver according to that
    agreement.Future situation: The contract can become even smarter by including
    GPS data of the route—that protects the customer from ‘confused’ cab drivers who
    take a detour. As always, incentives are everything.Products and services that
    we now pay for with a subscription plan can become metered commodities. Internet
    service providers can charge more for fast bits and less for slow ones. Users

    overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want
    to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders
    also have their own set of costs and benefits. All these conflicting incentives
    explain the challenges of the healthcare system in many countries.Future situation:
    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.Products and services that we now pay for with a subscription plan
    can become metered commodities. Internet service providers can charge more for
    fast bits and less for slow ones. Users can tweak their preferences. By setting
    an upper limit for prices, the user can overcome the hurdle of mental effort.3\.
    Rates Charged by Consultants and CoachesIf an appointment is considered a strict
    agreement between the participants, then the wallet can talk to a shared calendar
    application and GPS locations. The people in the meeting can no longer make excuses
    about lateness and cancelations. Jobs that are not easy to define in terms of
    time and deliverables can have contracts that start the meter whenever the client
    and consultant are together at a designated GPS location. Any day this happens,
    the money stream includes a minimum amount for travel time and cost. Alternatively,
    a fixed amount per minute retainer keeps the client caring about moving their
    part of the work to the finish line.4\. Smart Healthcare ContractsPeople that
    have a high-grade healthcare plan already know what this is like: you see the
    doctor, they treat your illness, and you walk out the door. That is because health
    insurance is already a kind of proto-smart contract. Insurance companies make
    deals with hospitals, and payments are regulated. Smart contracts of ideal money
    are likely to take over those arrangements.Present situation: Healthcare has many
    perverse incentives. Insurance companies and a portion of healthcare professionals
    view their patient’s illnesses like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t
    spend too long looking for root causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and
    apply the known cure. The patients care about their premiums but not the medical
    bills. The insurance companies push for discounts for buying treatments in bulk,
    but do not worry about the hospital staff’s administrative overhead. The medical
    staff doesn’t mind high prices for treatment; they want to treat patients quickly
    with minimal hassle. The hospital management and shareholders also have their

    Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives for each of the stakeholders.
    Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by piece, to any of the other three
    stakeholders in their health. Big data from masses of patients can lower their
    premium in real-time and raises the collective intelligence of the system. Smart
    contracts based on paid data take us into a future of fewer, happier patients,
    easy-going doctors and nurses, provably fair insurance contracts, and wealthy
    hospital owners.5\. Right-Priced Flights and RidesPresent situation: The fixed
    price of a ticket for public transport is the outcome of in-house accountants
    analyzing the cost structure and setting a price for some time. That is smart
    enough for the standard ride. However, some trips are not standard. The weather
    causes flight delays. The railroad track is blocked for a while. The bus is rerouted
    because of road construction. In such cases travelers have to accept their misfortune
    and will regret their purchase. The only thing they can do is to choose another
    means of transportation next time.Future situation: What if the traveler can get
    their money back in proportion to the delay? Insurance company AXA, through the
    brand name Fizzy, is already using the Ethereum blockchain to automate insurance
    for late flights. The contract is still crude: if the plane was two hours late,
    you get a refund. However, we can expect a rising level of granularity of the
    data for right-pricing tickets.All prices per unit can become ideal money so that
    the figure in your wallet application will move at various speeds in either direction.6\.
    Paying for AttentionThe proven way to monetize attention is through advertising.
    Online advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money,
    new transactions become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers.
    The exchanges can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target
    audience to review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so
    that they do not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have
    applied this model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other
    ways of pricing attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors
    on a subscription plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace
    it by moving the product purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money,
    innovations such as these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart
    contracts with ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource
    more financial decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more
    intelligent as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not
    having to think about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation:
    Content no longer needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal
    cost; that is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to
    do with the number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for
    delivering your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material
    so abundant that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution
    is to charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels
    on Amazon and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people
    do not bother with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell
    the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.Present situation: Healthcare has many perverse incentives. Insurance
    companies and a portion of healthcare professionals view their patient’s illnesses
    like lousy weather: it just happens. They don’t spend too long looking for root
    causes. Instead, they manage the symptoms and apply the known cure. The patients
    care about their premiums but not the medical bills. The insurance companies push
    for discounts for buying treatments in bulk, but do not worry about the hospital
    staff’s administrative overhead. The medical staff doesn’t mind high prices for
    treatment; they want to treat patients quickly with minimal hassle. The hospital
    management and shareholders also have their own set of costs and benefits. All
    these conflicting incentives explain the challenges of the healthcare system in
    many countries.Future situation: Behavioral data from patients can fix the incentives
    for each of the stakeholders. Patients can sell their behavior data, piece by

    sell the content as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples
    of this are Mindvalley.com and Masterclass.com. Paying for the content is pitched
    as a logical step in the journey. When sold at the right price, enough people
    will pay for that journey instead of pirating.Future situation: Content creators
    can make a smart contract that allows them to gamble on their audience. For example,
    when you empower your readers/watchers/listeners to get business success, you
    get a portion of their revenue. You become a mini-Amazon or Shopify. Ideal money
    will make it so easy to pay tribute to your teachers and gurus that it can replace
    traditional education and credentials.The progress of the Lightning Network implies
    that we can expect use cases for cryptocurrency to become available gradually,
    as fees fall. For all small transactions, we can now assume a future where most
    payments are almost free. The only remaining bottleneck is the size and growth
    of the network of users, which depends directly on usability.These examples show
    that payments will become granular, so that ideal money enables new value propositions
    by right-sizing and right-timing any amount. Money has finally entered the age
    of information.The proven way to monetize attention is through advertising. Online
    advertising has become granular and efficient already. With ideal money, new transactions
    become possible between content creators, audiences, and advertisers. The exchanges
    can start flowing the other way: advertisers can pay their target audience to
    review an offer. Moreover, viewers can pay for content directly so that they do
    not have to look at ads. The companies Brave, Steemit, and Earn have applied this
    model. As ideal money becomes the norm, we are likely to find other ways of pricing
    attention. For example, some companies let you pay for razors on a subscription
    plan. That saves you the effort to remember when to replace it by moving the product
    purchase into a subscription ‘contract.’ With ideal money, innovations such as
    these can turn up elsewhere, at larger and smaller scales.Smart contracts with
    ideal money become a part of our lives so that we can outsource more financial
    decisions to computer programs. These algorithms will become more intelligent
    as a result. These data-fueled AIs will give us the luxury of not having to think
    about money that much.7\. Paying for ContentPresent situation: Content no longer
    needs a specific medium. Digital publishing has near-zero marginal cost; that
    is, the cost of reproducing the story or information has nothing to do with the
    number of people viewing it. That means you can no longer charge for delivering
    your content to your audience; the free reproduction makes the material so abundant
    that any charging for content becomes a race to the bottom. One solution is to
    charge for convenience and curation. With entertainment, such as novels on Amazon
    and shows on Netflix, the seller charges so little that most people do not bother
    with pirating. With non-fiction information, online companies sell the content
    as part of a journey with a new identity and a lifestyle. Examples of this are
