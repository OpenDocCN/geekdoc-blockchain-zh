    and devices [[1](#CR1)] that gather and transmit data [[2](#CR2)–[9](#CR9)]. IoT
    is becoming more increasingly used to track the supplychain worldwide as it can
    improve companies ability to service their consumers while saving cost and increasing
    overall effectiveness. With data from IoT gadgets, movers, airlines, port establishments,
    weather, bulletin feeds, and satellite monitoring exchanging information through
    cellular systems, businesses may get a precise image of every step in the supply
    chain at any time. For instance, they may accurately estimate the arrival time,
    enhancing their capability to prepare for and accomplish on-time complete distributions.

    when dealing with few entities in supply chain such as the truck drivers. Businesses
    may automate time-consuming managerial and admin actions such as confirming a
    trucker’s cargo agent bond or dispensation a flier of lading or sharing the shipping
    manifests digitally by using smart logistics technologies. All of this is made
    feasible by integrating IoT with electronic data exchange (EDI) technologies.
    Electronic data interchange (EDI) structures automate information sharing with
    trade partners via defined data formats. When used with an appropriately designed
    IoT, EDI structures may be an efficient instrument for not simplifying the data
    transfers between the carrier/shipper/customers but also providing insights to
    the real and actual logistics information without having to rely on the need to

    of warehouse and supply chain supervision, and IoT may also help to this extent.
    Supply chain experts can build a precise and up-to-date inventory monitoring structure
    using sophisticated IoT sensors that mechanically perceive and evaluate inventory
    locations and stock levels. Most IoT inventory management solutions mechanically
    reunite inventory amounts with archives, eliminating the need for tedious manual
    counts and enhancing consistency and dependability. Additionally, the sensors
    on the devices collect information that can be evaluated through IoT-enabled warehouse
    supervision software to detect blockage spots and track inventory movements on
    a minute-by-minute basis, which define a warehouse’s operating efficiency. Smart
    shelves and RFID scanners are previously widely used as IoT inventory management
    solutions. RFID has grown in popularity as a means of monitoring high-value goods,
    and it also has the potential to be more efficient than conventional barcodes.
    Perhaps most excitingly, even more, sophisticated technology, such as inventory
    scanning drones, *Etheclobox* *(a special type of container)* is equipped with
    sensors that measure and store the temperature of goods at regular intervals [[1](#CR1)]
    are on the horizon.'

    machines, depending on their health. When one of these devices fails, it may cause
    significant delays in the supply chain, if not stop it entirely. An incident of
    this magnitude may be very expensive for the companies that depend on this supply
    chain. It is typical for warehouses to operate and handle various carriage vehicles
    along the supply chain, from cranes to trucks, forklifts, and SUVs. Because these
    vehicles are equipped with linked sensors, warning messages may be sent when maintenance
    is needed. Additionally, the IoT sensors may monitor the driver’s behaviour, location,
    and movements in real-time. Apart from this, within retail stores and business
    establishments where customers interact, connected devices and sensors ranging
    from security cameras to closed-circuit monitoring systems to RFID scanners to
    billing and point-of-sale systems all process critical information about customers
    and further process it for decision-making purposes. IoT devices are much more
    efficient at inventory management than people are. Amazon, for example, utilizes
    Wi-Fi-enabled robots to monitor inventory and orders through QR codes that the
    robot reads and transmits to a database [[12](#CR12)]. This method of inventory
    monitoring is more efficient than manual inventory management; it also results
    in fewer mistakes.'

    be integrated into the remainder of the supply chain, including warehouses, distribution
    centres, and manufacturing facilities. When certain products in the shop are on
    the verge of being sold out, the sensors detect this and alert the closest warehouse
    through the IoT network. This may result in the product being sent in extra quantities.
    Numerous advantages accrue, ranging from improved warehouse efficiency to improved
    inventory management and staff safety [[13](#CR13)]. For example, real-time position
    tracking enables on-site workers to readily identify products and quickly go to
    the aisle containing a certain product. Numerous Internet of Things applications

    their authority over artificiality to better business at a low price rate. Many
    chief administrations have endeavoured to enhance their info sources and share
    real-time data with the Supply chain (SC) administration. As you can refer in

    is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate human behaviour.
    In the 1950s, AI pioneer Arthur Samuel says, “the field of study gives computers
    the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed [[24](#CR24)]”. Machine
    learning is useful for perceiving critical information and necessary documents
    to make the SC partners more trustworthy. Expert system is another subfield of
    AI technology related to the attribute of acting like a human. This particular
    field is one of the most prominent research domains in AI. The areas of basic
    research of expert systems are decision-making, problem-solving, understanding
    of language and visual understanding. The four parts of the expert system are
    knowledge base, inference engine, justifier and user interface [[19](#CR19)].
    All the components work together to reach the appropriate solution and a statement
    and interface between the structure and its operator. This is very applicable
    in the SC management system as particularly, the capable system is recognized
    to increase output in handling logistics. It was reported that after using the
    capable system, IBM’s production output was increased by 35% and protected around
    $10 million of wealth outflow. Its successful application is evident in certain
    grounds like air traffic [[19](#CR19)] regulation, spatial mapping [[19](#CR19)],
    airline [[19](#CR19)] production supervision, and vehicle [[19](#CR19)] restoration

    is used in AI to figure out the possible solutions best suited for the surrounding
    situations. Therefore it is also a part of decision-making and problem-solving.
    GAs provide potential genetic solutions in a series at the initial moment. A variety

    is the primary [[28](#CR28)] part of the industrial process specially with the
    automation of the flow of goods between the location and the businesses [[2](#CR2)].
    To do so, the need for Blockchain comes into place. Blockchain digitizes and segregates
    the data into the transactional blocks/small units of information and keeps them
    encrypted and dependable to other blocks of data which ensures the integrity of
    the information and data and reduces the security-related risks with mitigation
    to cyber-attacks [[3](#CR3)]. The fundamental task of this subsequent sections
    is to present a supply chain [[29](#CR29)] system that is based on Blockchain
    [[29](#CR29)] mechanisms to guarantee the integrity of data in IIoT for Industrial
    applications. The system will provide real-time data authentication, transparency,
    Data security, and Data integrity. The system will comprise three sections, the
    data generated for the system, the transformation of data in the blockchain-enabled
    dataset [[30](#CR30)–[32](#CR32)], and accessing/fetching the blockchain-based
    data from the system. Hence, step-wise; we have chosen naïve chain (SHA-256) to
    build the dataset and performed the coding operations to achieve the blockchain-enabled
    data using React Js–Javascript. In this work, discuss Software requirements, like
    for JADE/PYTHON—React.JS for frontend and Backend model building. The entire System
    design is explained in the architecture. System Detailed description and then,
    System Testing is explained with the help of use-cases and test cases that will
    arise when the system gets implemented and go live [[33](#CR33), [34](#CR34)].
    The dataset will be generated via the web and the web will have four pages in
    total which will show the development and creation of distributed system under
    the Blockchain umbrella by encapsulating the blocks together to form a single
    bundled distributed system of sensors and smart devices [[4](#CR4)]. Today in
    the new generation where data plays the most persistent role in every aspect of
    life and its phases, we are experiencing vast growth in density of data, its complexity,
    chances of vulnerability, and change of state. Today, each device whether it’s
    a computer device or a mechanical device produces data at a large quota which
    is hard to maintain for most organizations and data originators. Big data is not
    only produced in all areas of development such as medical, information technology
    [[5](#CR5)], health care, business, and automation analysis, etc. The integrity
    of this data is the backbone of all these areas and organizations which is very
    hard to maintain and sustain throughout its life-cycle. In case if the integrity
    of the data is compromised in any manner, it will result in economic loss, system
    redundancy, high maintenance cost, and errors in the system. To mitigate all these
    aspects, blockchain enters into these areas to ensure the Buyya and Dasjerdi [[23](#CR23)]
    security and integrity of the Buyya and Dasjerdi [[23](#CR23)] big data [[23](#CR23)]

    System to guarantee Data Integrity and Security for IIoT Devices with regards
    to supply chain industry which has been depicted in Fig. [5](#Fig5). As per the
    architecture showin in Fig. [5](#Fig5), an IoT-based monitoring system which is
    getting raw signals and data from various sources, like the order placing information/label
    printers/assembly operations etc.. pushes the information via the gateway and
    network layer to the data processing layer where the data will be verified using
    blockchain distributed ledger technology and validates the data integrity and
    thereby ensuring the security of those supply chain applications/IOT devices.
    The unique need at each and every phase of this architecture has to be handled
    due diligently. Once we get the data from these IoT sensors/devices, it should
    automatically go to the Blockchain system and gets registered there to be fully
    aware of the chain of custody and if any problems arise during the above process.
    Once IoT-based systems generate the data, it should be filled in the Web page
    as an Enrollment process. The webpage consists of Hash page, Block Page and Blockchain
    Page, and Database Distributed Page. Once the data distribution is carried out
    along with the blockchain process, based on the primary requirement, Unique ID,
    then the data goes to different blocks and saved as on Date and time-based in
    individual blocks. Hence it enables the integrity of the information.![](../images/516210_1_En_10_Chapter/516210_1_En_10_Fig5_HTML.png)

    proposed system and the phased approach to implement the design. The proposed
    system implementation is categorized into four major modules which in turn has
    sub modules. The major functionalities are segmented to perform more than 10 different
    purposes. The whole idea of the design includes four important modules as Login
    module, Processing module, Secured Blockchain module and finally the evaluation
    module [[40](#CR40)]. The main idea of the login module [[40](#CR40)] is that,
    through it, the input is fetched into the system. The details like the requirement,
    sales order, purchase order, work order and the order’s primary information etc.
    were noted up. Care should be noted that, the details entered at the login user
    interface module is highly sensitive and unique which differs from user to user
    and from order to orders. So the primary focus towards the creation of a trustable
    user interface module is carried out. The proper validation and session management
    is also done. The function of the login module is

    integrating Blockchain technology into other enterprise applications creates a
    nightmare to standup an highly secured and heavily collaborative platform within

    trusted parties. Imagine the volume of data ingestion happening across the value

    such as managing the huge blocksizes for bitcoins (roughly 3–4 tps), ever evolving
    Riaden network to accommodate the etherum extensions to allow efficient transactions
    (roughly 20 tps atleast). As there is ever growing need to improve the agility
    and speed of transactions in a trusted environment, the data integrity and complexity

    advancements and its adoption and corresponding challenges and future trends,
    the above book chapters were written to provide key insgihts across the value
    chain stakeholders like suppliers, manufaturers, customers, system integrators,
    government agencies to build more context on these technologies and to advise
    building few proof of concepts for their respective needs and use cases. It’s
    worthwhile to re-iterate some of the key observations such as, Machine learning
    algorithms which is currently being deployed and used extensively to relieve supply
    chain pressure caused by supply chain disruptions. From providing the KPI insights
    to identifying the problems with the real streams from the market, artificial
    intelligence and machine learning is rapidly transforming supplychain landscape
    in each industry. Supply chain industry has been investing heavily in IoT (Internet
    of Things) to improve the operations resilience by bringing more automation in
    product monitoring and control, fleet tracking etc. Several IOT technologies such
    as RFID, EPC, Wi-Fi, GPS, QR codes [[41](#CR41)] allow companies to focus on the
    core tasks of running the business such as (i) Tracking physical asset movement
    and delivery across the supply chain. (ii) Transforming Logistics Industry and
    (iii) Field Service operations. As briefly explained in one of the book chapter,
    when it comes to realizing the value of trust between the supply chain partners,
    the existing protocol like EDI (Electronic Data Interface) and other technologies
    may not be preferred solution going forward because when some of companies evolve
    through Industry 4.0 landscape and not all partners have established the relationship
    between each of them across the supply chain and this where use of Blockchain
    technology has a unique opportunity to establish the statement of trust via Smart
    Contract. Future research will focus on establishing a more clearer picture of
    how the supply chain industry will shape up further to solidify the reference
    architecture, compliance, integration platforms for these technologies and improve
    the wider adoption across the spectrum.
