- en: Poloniex is one of the largest American exchanges for Bitcoin trading. According
    to the [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) aggregator service, it
    ranks second in transactions turnover among all world cryptocurrency exchanges
    trading Bitcoin. Despite this fact, Poloniex is among the exchanges that often
    malfunction (from what I’ve seen). Some people suspect it may soon go bankrupt.

- en: It is impossible to deposit conventional money onto the Poloniex exchange, i.e.
    dollars, euros, and so on. You can buy tokens to exchange on [tether.to](https://tether.to/).
    These tokens are practically not subject to change. Such stability makes me think
    that people will prefer holding their cryptocurrency assets precisely in these
    tokens in case of trouble. It would be a kind of safe haven.

    After you have registered on the exchange, you will have a very limited functionality
    available consisting of the amount of money you can deposit and withdraw from
    the exchange.

    to limit the possibility of drug traffickers, arms dealers, or money launderers
    using the exchange. Therefore, the people, who want to trade in = great volume
    are invited to undergo verification. It looks like this.

- en: Verification takes place in several stages, depending on the degree of desired
    anonymity. For example, four levels of verification will allow you to withdraw
    about $400,000 per month. But there is one setback. It may take a few weeks for
    your application to be reviewed considering the huge volume of users on the exchange
    It will take another couple of weeks to undergo verification and deposit money.
    Moreover, there is no guarantee your application will be approved.

- en: This exchange is a bit authoritarian for my taste. If its owners see problems
    with cryptocurrency on their exchange, they simply prohibit withdrawing it. People
    who own this currency have to bend over backwards to sell and withdraw it in another
    cryptocurrency.

    altcoin exchange. Virtually every new coin or token is available here. You can
    even trade small-cap coins. Their prices are usually "pumped up," which means
    they skyrocket and then plummet. It is good for you if you are a trader. I regard
    this exchange as one of the safest.'

    to find the one that best suits their needs. With that in mind, I want to clarify
    some issues regarding registration on cryptocurrency exchanges.

- en: When getting registered on an exchange, I definitely recommend turning on two-factor
    authentication (identification). Even if you are already registered, I recommend
    that you use this.

- en: I advise you to create an account on at least two exchanges; if something happens
    to one, you will be able to close the orders on another one. Be sure to use Bittrex
    if you decide to trade altcoins. Select another one by yourself.

    letters, and numbers. Do not count on being able to remember it even if your password
    is the simplest combination of letters in the world. Therefore, be sure to write
    it down on paper and hide it somewhere safe. You can even make yourself a password
    tattoo, but you must write it down somewhere, either on your body or on paper!
    The second rule is not to use this password anywhere else except for the exchange.
    You must have a separate email for each account on the exchange. If one of your
    email accounts is hacked and wrongdoers try to get into your account on the exchange,
    your other account will remain safe.'

    the exchange. These transactions must be confirmed via e-mail.

    you need to gear up for the fact that a hacker (or even an exchange owner) may
    steal your money at any time. Any exchange may also crash. Therefore, it is very
    dangerous to hold money on the exchange. I advise you to only keep money you trade
    with on the exchange and to store the rest in cold wallets.'
