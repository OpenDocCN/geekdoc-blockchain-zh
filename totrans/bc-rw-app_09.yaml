    intervention. The credentials are issued by an issuer, which is typically an educational
    institution authorized to provide an educational certificate to a candidate who
    fulfills the criteria to be awarded the relevant diploma or degree. The issuer
    ultimately acts as a certification-cum-verification authority, which, at the time
    of issuance of a certificate, affixes the validity of the details contained therein.
    The blockchain stores certificates with the signature (hash) of the issuer and
    the name of the receiver on thousands of nodes around the world, making it possible
    to verify the authority that originally issued the certificate. Credential owners
    (candidates) can store these credentials in their Pi Wallet and share to prove
    their eligibility to third parties on demand (see [Figure 9.2](#c09-fig-0002)).

    it is issued. Such degrees or certificates can be traded as a hash of the digital
    certificate or may be transferred from one entity to another as a token. The hash
    is simply a way of adding a link to the original document, which the user holds.
    This means that the mechanism permits the signature of the document to be published,
    without the need to publish the document itself, thus keeping the confidentiality

    This also applies to the manner in which professors document their research activities,
    course evaluation, and accreditation, and apply for funding and reimbursement
    through the appropriate hierarchy. This is the reason why bureaucracy is stealing
    precious time and attention from core activities in higher education institutions
    (HEI). The time and money that could be spent on student learning and research
    activities is spent on ineffective top-down hierarchies that undermine academic
    independence and autonomy. In HEIs, time and attention are limited cognitive resources
    that must be used for educating students and conducting research for the betterment

    Each record connected to the blockchain, whether a physician’s prescription, a

    fees, such as broker fees, attorney fees, exchange charges, transfer charges,
    investment fees, taxes, etc. Due to such a large number of third-party interventions,
    investing in foreign real estate becomes a costly affair. Also, even if an investor
    has an excellent credit score in the country of origin, it may not be valued so
    in the country where he wants to invest.

    six months to a year to find an ideal investment property. In addition, real estate
    is not as liquid as cryptocurrency, nor can it be listed on a public exchange
    and sold quickly during open hours. Hence, buying a property or converting it
    into cash is a daunting task.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Title management is one area in the real estate business that is highly prone
    to forgery and extortion. Every property owner, in order to protect his property,
    spends a lot on getting the title registered, freed from encumbrances, and transferring
    the ownership in his name in the municipality. As a global immutable ledger, blockchain
    offers all participants a single version of truth about the title of land ownership.
    As a result, processes, such as double-selling, forged registries, and encroachments
    that are often associated with real estate can be eliminated.

    of real estate titles in a risk-free and reliable manner. It makes land purchase,
    sale, and transfer cost-effective by reducing the complexity of the process. Regulating
    property trading with the help of smart contracts can eliminate the cost of the
    documentation process, the involvement of middlemen, and property appraisal agents.

    transaction to be executed when a set of certain pre-defined conditions are met.
    These contracts can be automated on the blockchain in the same way that, with
    a standing instruction, a bank pays interest amounts to its customers’ accounts
    over a period of time or recovers a loan. Smart contracts can introduce the concept
    of Smart Assets – a notion of transacting all assets on a blockchain-based model.
    A blockchain-based identity can be created for any hard asset in the physical
    world, which has been underscored several times in this book. Using these identities,
    ownership can be controlled through smart contracts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokenization has many benefits. It is a ledger maintained on a blockchain in
    which the possibility of third-party interference is almost zero, and which does
    not allow any kind of red tape to enter. It provides unmatched liquidity and secure
    cross-border exchange across the globe. Tokens allow only fragmented ownership,
    which often results in a lower cost of trading a real estate asset. With no room
    for devaluation of tokens, it provides an impeccable protection to speculators
    and buyers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flip side of tokenization is that the blockchain is still in its nascent
    stage. Malicious programs from hackers pose a tremendous threat to tokens that
    can create havoc for both buyers and speculators. Until regulations are framed
    for the purchase and exchange of tokens, a general mindset will not be able to
    widely accept it as an alternative to real estate.

    and transparent manner, for which the bureaucracy often spends billions of dollars
    and deploys government officials recklessly. The process involves election training,
    election material, temporary constructions to ensure voter’s access to the polling
    stations, vehicles for polling parties, digital voting machines, voter verifiable
    paper audit trails and printing of nomination papers, ballot papers, ballot accounts,
    declarations, three to four dozen documents, their envelopes, training material,

    voters to cast their votes from anywhere in the world, without compromising on
    security. It facilitates the electorate to vote comfortably on the day of polling,
    sitting at home, without standing in queue or completing redundant formalities.

    of the citizen’s data, such as place of usual residence (constituency, where he
    is eligible to vote), date of birth (when he attains the minimum age prescribed

    of the votes cast through the individual nodes, by cryptographic hash algorithms.
