- en: 'Blockchain and artificial intelligence are the two most rising computer technologies
    in this value-based medical healthcare and digital innovation. Both technologies
    deal with data but in different ways. Blockchain handles secure storage and sharing
    of data. On the other hand, artificial intelligence analyzes the data and generate
    insights from data to generate value. Blockchain and artificial intelligence can
    be combined to fuel the clinical healthcare system. A clinical decision support
    system (CDSS) is a healthcare IT tool that is designed to help the clinicians
    and caregivers by providing specific medical information of patient and clinical
    knowledge so that it can help in deciding to enhance patient care. Clinical decision
    support can be called as an active knowledge system  . CDSS uses various items
    from patient medical health data to generate specific advice. CDSS consists of
    knowledge base, inference engine, and communication mechanism. Clinical assistance
    tools  can be classified into two categories: knowledge and non-knowledge-based.
    Knowledge-based CDSS contains rules like the if-then statement and association
    of compiled data. Non-knowledge-based clinical decision-making system uses a type
    of artificial intelligence in place of knowledge base, and this allows the system
    to learn from experience to figure out the pattern in patient clinical data. The
    adoption of AI in healthcare transformed the way for the treatment process. Clinical
    decision support is a region where artificial intelligence can augment the clinical
    capacity, to collect and to understand the patient data for deciding for diseased
    diagnosis. Artificial intelligence transformed the clinical decision-making process.
    The AI application in the clinical field is significant and includes cases like
    AI bots for skin lesion detection for skin cancer, digital pathology, electronic
    health record, classification, and clinical assist support tool. In a clinical
    decision support system, a large amount of health data  is generated on a regular
    basis. Handling and storing a huge amount of data are very crucial because of
    the highly sensitive nature of medical inputs. In clinical system 3s (safe, secure,
    scalable), information sharing is imperative for diagnosis and decision-making.
    Medical information sharing is very crucial for every medical practitioner to
    share the medical health information of the patient to the hospital management
    for decision-making. The two major fields are telehealth and e-health, where data
    is transmitted at a distant location (to professional) for an expert opinion.
    We can call this process a real-time clinical monitoring process. But in all these
    arrangements, security, sensitivity, and privacy are major challenges. But the
    solution to this problem is blockchain. Blockchain can be used for the reliable
    distribution of information, e-health data sharing. Blockchain use a P2P network
    merged with a multi-field n/w framework composed of cryptography, mathematical
    including algorithms. Some important key features of blockchain are decentralized
    technology, unchangeable, open-source, incognito, and autonomy, and healthcare
    data gateway, Ethereum, BlocHIE (blockchain-based platform for healthcare information
    exchange), FHIRChain (fast healthcare interoperability resources), and DermoNET
    are some blockchain-based methods which are used in clinical decision support
    system to facilitate safe and secure use of medical tools, to keep an up-to-date
    record of the patient, and to secure data storage. In this chapter we discussed
    clinical decision support tools with needs and challenges, the role of blockchain
    and artificial intelligence in healthcare, and different CDS tools and also discussed
    blockchain-based CDS systems.'

    system is known as blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a very secure
    platform where patient health data can be stored as well as shared without the
    loss and fear of misuse of information. Before implementing blockchain technology
    in medical healthcare organizations, it is important to understand the working
    principle of a secured blockchain (Chen et al., [2019](#CR6); Yoon, [2019](#CR44);
    Krawiec et al., [2016](#CR24)). Blockchain technology is “temper evident and tamper-resistant
    digital ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion and usually without a central
    authority. At primary level, blockchain permits a set of authorized users to record
    the transaction in a shared ledger within that community, such that under normal
    operation of the blockchain network no transaction can be changed once published”
    (Yaga et al., [2018](#CR42)). This distributed ledger secured system support transparency,
    data integrity, and decentralization. Here block and chain both are different.
    The digital information  is represented by blocks, and the information storage
    process is represented by a chain. Generally, digital information forms a block
    in the ledger. The other three main important points are as follows: (I) it stores
    the blockchain transaction information like amount, time, date, etc. But now it
    can also store other types of data like images and documents. (II) In the block,
    the information about participants is stored. But in the real name of the participant
    is not used, for this, a unique digital private key is given to the user to use
    it at the place of the real name. (III) Every block is different, so block uses
    a “hash” to uniquely identify the user’s blocks (Gwyneth Iredale, [2020a](#CR10),
    [b](#CR11); Musleh et al., [2019](#CR30)). Figure [10.1](#Fig1) shows the timelines
    of blockchain which tell us when this tamper-proof and insanely secure technology
    starts and who introduced this technology.![../images/504166_1_En_10_Chapter/504166_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_10_Chapter/504166_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.png)'

    the real problems in healthcare organizations where applying this technology proved
    valuable. A blockchain-enabled healthcare information system can break the true

    of current intermediaries. Blockchain technology works as an enabler of nationwide
    interoperability (Molero, [2016](#CR28)). The office of the national coordinator
    (ONC)  for health information technology is a principal federal entity, and it
    is handled by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ([https://​www.​healthit.​gov/​topic/​about-onc](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/about-onc)).

    feature of blockchain that makes sure that this technology will always remain
    the same: it is permanent and inevitable. Blockchain technology is different from
    traditional banking. It does not rely on a centralized system process; here a
    set of nodes ensures the blockchain features. In blockchain-based transaction
    system, a transaction block is added to the ledger with the majority of nodes.
    Backup and modification are also not possible after adding the transaction blocks
    to the blockchain ledger. Identification verification and property deeds are two
    applications where immutable is very useful. Previously, dictators or political
    leaders have nullified the prior approved property acts for their benefits. But
    in the presence of blockchain technology, these takeovers are not possible because
    stored block on ledger ensures the owner’s rights. Identity stored on the blockchain
    in encrypted form ensures that only authorized person can access the sensitive
    information, and this process also reduces the risk of identity theft  (Yue et

    major reason for immutability, deceitful, and censorship resistance. Decentralization  means
    it is the process by which the activity of the organization is controlled by local
    authorities rather than a centralized governing body or a single person. We can
    store everything like personal documents, cryptocurrencies, and valuable assets.
    This information can be accessed by the owner directly by using the private key
    and without taking permission from any governing body. Government and another
    attacker cannot use the central database for their benefits due to the decentralized
    nature of this technology. Proof of work is one of the consensus mechanisms of
    blockchain technology that require an extensive amount of effort to identify frivolous
    use of computing power like spam mail  and DoS attacks.

    into the system network for their network. Here encryption is another way of security
    into this system. Blockchain is extremely secure because of its special feature
    “cryptography.” Decentralization and cryptography both are the perfect way of
    protecting the information for different users. Cryptography is known as a secured
    method in which sensitive information is protected and also works as a firewall.
    Different types of information in blockchain architecture are stored in a way
    that hides its true nature. In this process, input information passes through
    an algorithm that changes its original form into something different. We can give
    the name of this whole process “unique identification.” Blocks in the ledger have
    unique hash and also contain the information about the previous hash. Hashing
    is complex and the ant is reversed. So that any type of modification is impossible.
    The private key is required to access the information, and the public key is required
    to make the transaction. That’s why cryptography is known as the best key component  of
    the blockchain technique (Gwyneth Iredale, [2020a](#CR10), [b](#CR11)).

    technology more useful to simulate human intelligence a machine that can behave
    like human beings. The first-time AI was described by John McCarthy in 1956\.
    AI in healthcare can solve the problematic healthcare challenges and early disease
    detection, reduce the severity of the disease, and can also interpret healthcare
    data which is obtained by diagnosis processes of disease like dementia, diabetes,
    various types of cancer, and cardiovascular disease. A study of computer science
    algorithms which improve automatically through various experiences is recognized
    as a machine learning technology. Machine learning  , a type of AI technology,
    has changed the way of living from human language and handwritten recognition,
    image retrieval, and weather forecasting. Every day lots of healthcare data are
    generated, and it is also very complex to understand. More complex data means
    the use of artificial intelligence to extract meaningful information from this
    data. The nonchronic disease  is those types of disease that are not spread from
    person-to-person but have a long duration and slow progression. We can include
    heart disease, various types of cancer, asthma, and diabetes in chronic disease.
    The compilation of chronic disease can be minimized by early disease detection
    which helps in making treatment plans. Here the use of artificial intelligence
    may prove to be correct. Currently, healthcare is ready for major changes. In
    the healthcare sector, various areas are available like cardiovascular disease,
    cancer treatment, risk assessment, decision-making, and many more where we can
    take advantages of technology. Artificial intelligence can be more accurate and
    precise because they communicate with training data set, patient care, treatment,
    etc. Diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using a multilevel set of segmentation
    algorithm with feature extraction using svm with selective features (Kandhasamy
    et al., [2019](#CR22)). In 2018, medical experts and researchers presented an
    artificial intelligence world medical innovation forum in which more than ten
    areas of the healthcare sector have a major impact on artificial intelligence.
    With the help of medical experts, Harvard Medical School faculty chief data science
    officers and director of research at Massachusetts present the best way artificial
    intelligence will change the science and delivery system of healthcare (Siyal

    tools for detecting cancer at an early stage. Artificial intelligence is one of
    the growing research areas in medical healthcare and is used to extract important
    information from medical health data. The AI-based system is used to interpret
    medical data generated by mammograms and also translate patient health records
    into diagnosis which can be used to accurately predict breast cancer. Mammography
    uses low-energy-based x-rays to find out the breast disease at the initial stage
    for diagnosis. iTBra is one of the wearable devices developed by tachycardia health
    for breast scanning. Various artificial intelligence-based techniques are the
    neural network, computer-aided design, decision tree, linear programming, and
    nearest neighbor. Now some artificial intelligence-based cancer detection techniques

    researcher trained an AI algorithm to identify the early sign and reduction of
    glucose consumption into the brain from imaging modality positron emission tomography
    (PET). In PET imaging radioactive amount is injected into the patient body, and
    it generates a 3D image of metabolism and other circulation activities. According
    to radiologist Jae Ho Sohn (UCSF), PET scan is best for an AI-based tool because
    AD can cause subtle changes in metabolism to begin before tissue degrades. After
    all, capturing these tissues is very hard to pick up. First, for this AI-based
    algorithm, more than 12 years of study was done to track AD, mild AD, and healthy
    people. In this, more than 2000 PET images of 1000 people who are around 55 and
    more in the age were trained and tested. This algorithm is tested into two phases.
    In the first phase, 90% of the data set was trained by the algorithm, and 10%
    of the data set was tested. In the second phase, the algorithm was retested on
    the data set  which was prepared by the study of 10 years on 40 patients. The
    result of the algorithm shows that it can diagnose AD in more than 80% of the
    data set in the first phase and 100% in the second phase. It is a deep learning-based
    algorithm that uses an AI network. Physicist Christian Salvatore says that this
    is the first promising and preliminary algorithm of deep learning used to diagnose
    AD. According to him this model identifies mild or late AD in patients very well,
    but catching  at a very early stage is still a very challenging task (Amisha et
    al., [2019](#CR3); Cruz & Wishart, [2006](#CR7); Mishra et al., [2017](#CR27)).

    diseases are included in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular medicine doctors
    combine AI with an electrocardiogram to improve patient care. The four main applications
    of AI in cardiovascular disease include precision medicine, prediction, image
    analysis, and smart robots. Initially, AI is applied for medication reminder,
    counseling, symptoms warning, and remote follow-up. It can also be used to connect
    the e-health records system and reduce the workloads of healthcare workers. AI
    in the future can help the healthcare experts in decision-making and also predict
    the treatment result of the patient. Researcher Timothy J. W. Dawes suggests in

    more than 30,000 points with every heartbeat, and this information is combined
    with the recorded 8 years of patient health records so that AI can predict the

- en: A clinical decision-making system is one of the applications of information
    technology that is used to improve healthcare services by improving the medical
    decisions with the targeted patient record, medical knowledge, and other related
    healthcare information. It mainly focuses on knowledge management to make a decision
    based on two or more factors of patient health-related data. The idea behind the
    clinical decision support program is to support medical experts and their decisions
    in the same way as the enterprise decision support program helps business administrative
    make better decisions about corporations and enterprises (Johnson et al., [2018](#CR21)).
    The concept of decision support system (DSS)  was introduced in 1950–1960 for
    theoretical study, but in the middle of 1970, computer-based DSS grew and became
    an area of research and development. At that time, CDSS had a lack of integration
    and was limited to academics only. In 1970, the use of CDSS in medical and in
    physician autonomy was not acceptable due to ethical and legal issues. But now
    CDSS in medical system uses web application with electronic health records to
    analyze data to make clinical decision to enhance patient care.

    medical records, patient’s health records, different disease reports, and other
    clinical records. Digitization and quantity of data do not improve health services
    and patient care. In the study, it was found that electronic medical records and
    CPOE have reduced medical errors. So CDS support system is necessary for the hospitals
    to take full advantage of electronic health medical reports. In the current healthcare
    system, most of the healthcare experts have issues like no knowledge about how
    to access the patient data and how to search for particular data. Additionally,
    health experts decide by doing physical meeting with the patient instead of the
    online meeting which means some decisions by experts are taken into minutes and
    also depend on patient physical parameters. According to the research, today also
    the decision-making process  depends on the knowledge and experience of professionals.
    The patient condition before admission to the hospital is always ignored by hospital
    staff; they looked into only the present condition. But the clinical supportive
    system has all the information about patient’s health and can also analyze minute
    changes in patient health (Sutton et al. [2020a](#CR37), [b](#CR38)).

    Disease’s sign and symptoms are independent variable, and identified disease comes
    under the dependent variable. All arranged information like hospital general information
    and patient health information is contained in the knowledge-based system, and
    then rule statement (if-then) is applied to this information to make clinical
    decisions. These expert’s CDS system is applicable in medical applications. It
    sends an alert message to the patient at the time of taking the wrong drug which
    may harm the patient’s health. Rule-based CDS tools for the medical system can
    be created by an expert only who can handle and train the system. To train the
    knowledge-based system is very critical and time-consuming. Literature, practice,
    and patient health records are used to create rules  (if-then) (Arnott et al.,

    different kinds of medical conditions and also provide better care to the patient
    at a global level. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)  is a very innovative 3D
    mammography that provides very fine detail of tissues and also enhances lesion
    visibility. When DBT is combined with magnetic resonance imaging, it improves
    the accuracy of treatment by reducing errors. It can quickly identify abnormalities
    and cancer at a very early stage ([https://​www.​predictiveanalyt​icstoday.​com/​what-is-ai-based-medical-imaging/​](https://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/what-is-ai-based-medical-imaging/)).

    understanding mammograms and 3D breast tomosynthesis reports. To understand the
    mammograph report of the patient, it integrates machine learning with a large
    mammography data set. A new concept “Transpara decision support system” is developed
    by the ScreenPoint founder. First, it found all the reasons due to which a radiologist
    needs a decision support system and helps find out the irregularity in soft tissues
    as well as in calcification. Medical experts examine suspicious regions in an
    image for making a judgment. Transpara™ uses a 10-point scale to categorize mammograms
    by using analysis and deep learning approach. If abnormalities are less than the
    point score, then the point score is less; if abnormalities are high, then the
    point score is also high. Transpara™ CAD also provides calcified coronary artery
    disease marks which can be viewed on the Transpara™ tablet viewer mammography
    display. They also show soft tissue growth with a false-positive rate. Transpara™
    digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) readers can jump on relevant 3D digital breast
    slice in both mediolateral oblique view and craniocaudal view by clicking suspicious
    region in the mammogram. It marks the abnormal area in the slice and then provides
    decision support for abnormal lesions  for the relevant slices.

    designed a BlocHIE  architecture. BlocHIE is a blockchain-based system designed
    for healthcare information exchange of healthcare institutions like a hospital,
    small clinic, and any other medical services providers and individual patient.
    BlocHIE contains some important components: BlocHIE network, medical service providers
    and institutions, and the individual patient. Here BlocHIE n/w, the task of sharing
    and storing healthcare data is performed. In a medical service provider, when
    new patients visit into the clinic, then their health data is submitted on the
    network and can also be shared with other caregiver experts for supporting collaborative
    service. An individual patient comes as a third component of BlocHIE platform.
    Patient health data generated with wearable smart medical devices like smart Fitbit
    band, thermometer, wearable ECG monitors, and sphygmomanometer can be submitted
    directly to the BlocHIE platform. Here medical healthcare providers (hospital
    and clinics) and individual patients are taken as separated because both follow
    the different rules and regulations for storing and sharing the information on
    BlocHIE network. Data shared by healthcare institutions are very highly sensible
    and private, and authentications service is also very necessary. For example,
    if a patient takes some treatment from the hospital, then these data reports are
    signatures from both parties: hospital and patient; then both parties cannot deny
    this treatment report. And when it comes to the individual patient record, the
    main focus will be on data quantity. This generated healthcare patient data is
    remarkable. For each patient, it is compulsory to complete the healthcare data
    before sharing it to take more advantages of treatment in the future. In this
    case, throughput and fairness are two important keys for sharing and storing personal
    healthcare data on BlocHIE network. In the entire BlocHIE platform, a loosely
    coupled blockchain design for both (EMR chain and PHD chain) is used. For privacy
    and identification purpose, BlocHIE network used two different services: off-chain
    is the first variation which is used for storage, and the second variation of
    blockchain services is on-chain which is used for verification. These services
    remove the cloud service dependency. BlocHIE architecture network framework  is

    (CDSS), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology in a healthcare
    organization. Advanced healthcare technology developments improved the ability
    of medical caregivers, experts, and clinical staff to predict the power of AI
    on medicine practice, patient care, and treatment results. The CDS system has
    enhanced medical services by helping medical experts in the decision-making process.
    It reduces treatment cost and time and improves treatment care result. If CDS
    is integrated with artificial intelligence, then the performance of the system
    also increases. In this chapter, we discussed some AI-based imaging systems (breast
    cancer and some general imaging). These advanced AI-based imaging techniques significantly
    enhanced the understanding level of medical experts for the disease detection
    process. On the other side, the CDSS system relies on electronic health records
    (EHR) in which hospital management records all information about the patient’s
    health. Electronic medical records are shared among different medical experts
    for better treatment. But the sharing of EHR is very risky because it contains
    the patient’s personal information. So blockchain is applied in an AI-based system
    to make the sharing process secured and reliable.
