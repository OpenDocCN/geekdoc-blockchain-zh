  zh: 1 引言
- en: Today is the era of Internet of things (IoT) in which all the devices are required
    to be connected through the Internet. Therefore, the connectivity is the requirement
    of this system [[1](#CR1)]. The mobile communication is one of the important communication
    media for this application. Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we live
    and work. Their success and real value come from the establishment of services
    on top of the connected IoT devices. According to the Ericsson Mobility Report,
    there will be over 30 billion connected devices worldwide by 2023, of which around
    20 billion will be IoT related devices. Between 2017 and 2023, IoT devices are
    expected to increase at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 19%, driven by
    promising IoT use cases, like smart wearables, smart display, smart metering,
    robotic control/production automation, robotic surgery, autonomous driving car,
    and drone surveillance. These applications are usually integrated with wireless
    mobile communications [[2](#CR2)]. Currently, a number of smart IoT devices exploit
    cellular networks like 3G and 4G LTE to maintain their connectivity and their
    connection with the cloud data centers. As the skyrocketing of data produced by
    increasingly large number of IoT devices, there are several burning issues to
    be solved in the application environments. For example, the transmission latency
    and reliability of current cellular networks cannot be guaranteed, which in turn
    limits the effectiveness and feasibility of many emerging IoT applications, such
    as the autonomous driving car and robotic surgery, which ask for ultra-low latency
    and ultra-high reliability. 5G has been introduced with the capability of high
    throughput, low latency, high reliability, and increased scalability to enable
    massive number of devices with best QoS and QoE provision of ubiquitous connectivity
    solution to fulfill diversified IoT application requirements. This brings potentials
    to deploy more connected devices without worrying about an overcrowded network
    exacerbating existing issues. The high speed and reliable connectivity underpinned
    by 5G will create new possibilities for IoT services far beyond those available
    today. In addition, the enabling technologies of 5G, including functions virtualization
    and softwarization, software defined networking, massive MIMO (Multiple Input
    and Multiple Output), mobile/edge computing, and ultra-dense networks, have great
    potentials to usher in a new era of IoT, aiming to smoothly and flexibly support
    heterogeneous IoT services with distinct business characteristics under massive
    smart devices [[3](#CR3)]. Furthermore, IoT will bring a rich source of big data.
    The powerful role of big data analytics in 5G can undoubtedly benefit IoT advancement.
    This chapter is important to understand the concept of the Cloud Computing and
    Edge Standards, Security Fundamentals for 5G network, and other security measures.
    Then, we discussed Architecture of 5G-enabled IoT, Security Threats in 5G-Enabled
    IoT, Security Analysis, Privacy Threats in 5G-Enabled IoT, Security and Privacy
    Threats in Specific Domain, and Challenges and Opportunities [[4](#CR4)].

  zh: 如今是物联网（IoT）时代，在这个时代，所有设备都需要通过互联网连接。因此，连接性是这个系统的要求[[1](#CR1)]。移动通信是这种应用的重要通信媒介之一。物联网（IoT）正在改变我们的生活和工作方式。它们的成功和真正价值来自于在连接的物联网设备之上建立服务。根据爱立信移动报告，到2023年，全球将有超过300亿个连接设备，其中约200亿个将是物联网相关设备。在2017年至2023年期间，预计物联网设备以每年19%的复合年增长率增长，受到前景光明的物联网用例的推动，如智能可穿戴设备、智能显示器、智能计量、机器人控制/生产自动化、机器人手术、自动驾驶汽车和无人机监视。这些应用通常与无线移动通信集成[[2](#CR2)]。目前，许多智能物联网设备利用像3G和4G
    LTE这样的蜂窝网络来维持它们的连接和与云数据中心的连接。随着物联网设备产生的数据数量急剧增加，在应用环境中有几个迫切解决的问题。例如，当前蜂窝网络的传输延迟和可靠性无法保证，这反过来限制了许多新兴物联网应用的有效性和可行性，如自动驾驶汽车和机器人手术，这些应用要求超低延迟和超高可靠性。5G具有高吞吐量、低延迟、高可靠性和增强可伸缩性的能力，以实现大规模设备的最佳QoS和QoE，并提供普遍连接解决方案，以满足多样化的物联网应用需求。这为部署更多的连接设备带来了潜力，而不必担心过度拥挤的网络加剧现有问题。5G支持的高速可靠连接将为远远超出今天可用的物联网服务带来新的可能性。此外，5G的使能技术，包括功能虚拟化和软件化、软件定义网络、大规模MIMO（多输入多输出）、移动/边缘计算和超密集网络，具有极大的潜力，可以引领物联网的新时代，旨在平稳灵活地支持具有不同业务特性的异构物联网服务，在大规模智能设备下[[3](#CR3)]。此外，物联网将带来丰富的大数据资源。大数据分析在5G中的强大作用无疑将有利于物联网的进步。本章对理解云计算和边缘标准、5G网络的安全基础知识以及其他安全措施至关重要。然后，我们讨论了5G启用的物联网架构、5G启用的物联网中的安全威胁、安全分析、5G启用的物联网中的隐私威胁、特定领域的安全和隐私威胁以及挑战和机遇[[4](#CR4)]。

    It uses some standard mechanisms to access multiple configurable resources such
    as application, storage, networks, servers, and services. The first time cloud
    computing mentioned to the world is in a Compaq internal document as early as
    1996\. Several years later, cloud computing has come into actuality. In 2006,
    Amazon introduced the created Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [[6](#CR6)], which can
    support Amazon Web Services [[7](#CR7)]. Two years later, Google delivered the
    Google App Engine. In the 2010s, there are various Smarter Computing foundations
    appeared after IBM released IBM SmartCloud. In these smarter computing frameworks,
    cloud computing is a critical component. There are many service models for cloud
    computing; three models are accessible that are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    [[8](#CR8)], Platform as a Service (PaaS) [[9](#CR9)], and Software as a Service
    (SaaS) [[10](#CR10)]. Cloud computing has many advantages such as it enables to
    reduce the cost, it can be minimal effort to manage the infrastructure, and the
    users only need to pay when they need process and store data in a private or public
    cloud. It can adapt to fluctuations.

    cost of security and privacy threats is prohibitive. It is not only considered
    as potentially damaging to the monetary penalty, but also causing other more pressing
    issues such as consumer confidence, social trust, and personal safety. In this
    part, we mainly describe the difference between security and privacy. Security
    indicates against the unauthorized access of data. Privacy refers to protect the
    personal identification information. For example, a credit report agency enables
    to protect the customers’ personal information with security strategy, but the
    data scientist may still access this private information. Table [11.1](#Tab1)

    typically resource constrained. To adapt to unapproved access to, stealing of
    information, gadgets ought to be furnished with authentication, authorization
    process, and information protection abilities that guaranteed newness, legitimacy,
    classification, and uprightness of data. Protection (for example, unlink ability,
    information mystery, and obscurity) must be precisely saved since individual and
    delicate data could be taken and manhandled by an attacker. Encryption is central
    to give sensitive information a fundamental degree of security. Without a doubt,
    it forestalls that communicated information can be captured and perused by aloof
    foes. Encoding the data may utilize computationally costly cryptographic techniques
    (for example, pairing based cryptography), which could not be executed by IoT
    gadget. So as to distinguish appropriate cryptographic ways to deal with the IoT,
    Malina et al. [[47](#CR47)] estimated the exhibition of the most utilized approach,
    (for example, RSA, secure hashing calculations, and AES) on probably the most
    widely recognized micro-controller preparing IoT gadgets. They found that while
    hashing and symmetric encoding activities take barely milliseconds and can run
    on extremely restricted micro-controllers, more grounded approaches, for example,
    RSA (by a 2048-bit private key), can cause delays into several milliseconds, which
    are unfortunate progressively to IoT applications. Handling of complex activities
    could be left to the cloud or to communication passages, bringing the decrease
    of the gadgets’ vitality utilization and calculation delays. Be that as it may,
    this technique requires trustful doors and secure correspondence among parties.
    A reasonable method to ensure identities (the two gadgets and clients) from being
    followed is concealing their genuine character by methods for pseudonyms. Anyway,
    as additionally recommended, when assailants listen to information bundle inside
    an adequately wide time window of perception, they may unveil genuine casualties
    identifier. As portrayed later in this paper, at the point when associated with
    a LTE network, IoT gadgets can translate messages communicated by the network
    to find a particular endorser. Such messages contain just impermanent identifiers,
    yet a latent foe might misuse decoded data to recover relationship among brief
    extraordinary identifiers. Here we contend that despite the fact that the use
    of security approaches in structure and execution stages, security goals in the
    IoT could not be accomplished in light of its multifaceted nature. At that point,
    a far reaching comprehension of inspirations driving protection shortcomings and
    coming about recognizable proof of suitable relief activities in light of them
    requires a natural procedure fit for investigating the wide and various IoTs from
    particular viewpoints.

    likewise give vitality and spectrum effectiveness. Made out of heterogeneous hubs
    with various radio access advances (for example, LTE, WiMax, IEEE 02.15.x), impart
    power, and inclusion zone, UDNs are described by a multi-level architecture. In
    detail, high-power hubs and low-power hubs, with enormous and little radio inclusion,
    are set individually in large scale cell tiers and in small cell tiers. Cellular
    correspondence infrastructure, if from one hand, makes it conceivable to offer
    pervasive network to the most gadgets and, from the other hand, is wasteful for
    sending little, small information as required by M2M. In addition, cellular correspondence
    infrastructure could make it conceivable to follow substances engaged with data
    trade forms, in this manner influencing their location protection. Spatial dissemination
    of low-power hubs may impact the entire system security. Explicitly, the likelihood
    of positive mystery rate, that is the limit deviation of the working channel from
    the spy channel, increments as the thickness of low-power hubs develops (until
    a basic point, after which is not watched any upgrade in terms of mystery execution).
    Also, the higher the density of gadgets engaged with correspondence, the higher
    is the danger of data listening. Evidently, while moving inside a UDN, elements
    are probably going to be dependent upon more handover forms than in the current
    systems, making it workable for untrusted subjects to partake in the just referenced

    AMI is distributed globally to bridge the gap between end consumers and utilities,

    wide area network (WAN), and home area networks (HAN). The smart grid lays the
    foundation for a reasonable electricity marketplace. Hence, value integrity attacks
    can severely damage the product demand and supply balance, causing grid uncertainty,

    Partnership Project (3GPP) to standardize 3G, 4G, and 5G technologies in order
    to establish a secure network with serving networks (SN). AKA works on symmetric
    cryptography and sequence number (SQN). AKA is used in all 3G and 4G USIM (universal
    subscriber identity module) which is used in almost all the IoT devices. A few
    instances of security breach have occurred due to the fake base station attacks
    like the non-protected identity request mechanism to eavesdrop and inject messages.
    In 5G AKA protocol, asymmetric encryption is introduced to help in the authentication
    of identifiers [[26](#CR26)].

    improving the privacy requirements. Instead of sending the messages directly,
    the protocol encrypts it using randomized asymmetric encryption. Although this
    prevents the IMSI attacks, it still is not enough to prevent the attacks applicable
    to 3G and 4G networks. In IMSI, a commonly observed flaw of AKA protocol in 3G
    and 4G was that it’s very easy to track subscribers in a geographical region by
    just broadcasting an identity request in that region to the UEs. Hence, to protect
    messages carrying identity requests, developer uses stronger cryptographic mechanisms
    in 5G [[28](#CR28)] has proposed a new model to analyze the AKA model called Tamarin

  zh: 5 结论
- en: In this chapter, the author has discussed how 5G technology would be used for
    the development of smart grids and understanding the role of IDS in providing
    a secure grid for the customers. The author illustrated various methods to make
    the D2D connections more secure using AEAD ciphers and an ECC-based public-key
    cryptosystem. They enumerate about the UAV IoT framework and the different methods
    which could be implemented to secure data. Next, they discussed about how communication
    between vehicles can be done in a secure way to avoid traffic and accidents using
    pseudonym- and group/ring signature-based privacy schemes. Network slicing is
    one of the key requirements in 5G technology to meet its standards, and this is
    possible by incorporating end-to-end encryption. Although this is prone to security
    and privacy issues, a few solutions were mentioned like the PKI and certificateless
    encryption. Later, the author has discussed how 5G has helped the hearing-impaired
    individuals by lip reading methods, which send the information in the form of
    audiovisuals that are encrypted by advanced encryption and use algorithms like
    PWLCM for a secure network. Finally, the chapter focuses on the various improvements
    in 5G AKA protocols to solve the privacy constraints which were absent in 4G protocols,
    as it is challenging to maintain data security and privacy in the field of connectivity,
    computation, science, and 5G-enabled IoT. This chapter has discussed the overall
    security and privacy issues in 5G-enabled IoT. Each of these issues has been debated
    with presently available and possible solutions. At the end of this chapter, the
    authors have discussed the various case studies which cover the different security
    and privacy domains of 5G IoT applications and thus helped the reader to gain
    an insight of the current fields of research on security and privacy of 5G IoT.

    and easier lifestyle to human beings by physically connecting sensors and other
    embedded devices. Moreover, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
    (AI) add intelligence and self-learning capabilities in machines which significantly
    attract many users and devices to get connected with the Internet which significantly
    affects the automation of industry [[1](#CR1)]. The globally connected IoT devices
    generate billions of data on a daily basis which can be used for training the
    models through machine learning techniques to incorporate intelligence with devices.
    By applying various AI techniques to the large amount of data generated by various
    IoT sensors, more automated IoT devices can be designed [[1](#CR1)]. The expansion
    of big data and, recently, the applications of AI technologies in different fields
    have expanded rapidly. In object detection, image recognition, computer translation,
    speech control, and more advanced areas such as drug structure analysis, due to
    high intelligence, high availability, and high performance, artificial intelligence
    technologies have been applied. Moreover, deep learning (DL) is attracting many
    industries in the field of computer vision to add momentum to AI-based applications.
    However, AI and ML with IoT are the most revolutionary technologies today; security
    concerns become the center of attraction for the major researchers.

    trying to offer some tests to show they’ve learned something right. Similarly,
    the machine learning techniques’ pre-learning phase is performed along with training
    data, and few other databases have been used to check whether the model has been
    properly trained [[19](#CR19)]. Because machine learning’s logical and mathematical
    architecture will cause regularization, it means to remember the data pattern.
    In that case, the method is not effective because it has merely been memorized.
    It’s similar again for the learning cycle of humans as if we remember something,
    it can be successful in the short term but it doesn’t mean we’re going to pass
    the main exam. When a machine learning approach works in the testing process as
    well, then it can be approved to be implemented in actual applications. Basically,
    it can be said for all machine learning techniques the process involves the “reading,”
    “testing,” and “download” phases (Fig. [13.10a](#Fig10)) [[20](#CR20)].![../images/501059_1_En_13_Chapter/501059_1_En_13_Fig10_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_13_Chapter/501059_1_En_13_Fig10_HTML.png)

    因为机器学习的逻辑和数学结构会导致正则化，这意味着记住数据模式。 在这种情况下，该方法不是有效的，因为它仅仅是被记住了。 对于人类的学习周期而言，这又是相似的，如果我们记住了某些东西，它在短期内可能会成功，但这并不意味着我们会通过主要考试。

    of the people. The application of smartphones provides comfort to the user and
    also provides security by single access from phone. The architecture of smart
    homes consists of the network connectivity, sensor, and application. A smart door
    system plays an important role in the smart home automation. The data is stored
    in the centralized server so there are chances of the unauthorized person to access
    the data. To solve this problem, the idea of the blockchain is proposed. Blockchain
    provides the integrity and authentication to smart door applications. The sensors
    are used to detect the motion of the person entering into the house through a
    smart door. Due to blockchain implemented in the smart door, any intruder cannot
    access the data. Oftentimes IoT devices cannot address the issue; therefore, 5G
    technology overcomes the limitations.

    AI and machine learning work on the set of parameters which must be secured from

    work on some sensitive information like patient’s health data, biometric data
    for authentication, etc. which must be secured from the intruders as well as to
    train and deploy the model built on these data using some statistical parameters
    that need to be secured to prevent adversarial effects. The intruder may manipulate

    Storing data at the central server decreases the chances of external attacks on
    data and statistical parameters but has the risk of a single point of failure
    which redirects to adopt a distributed environment. Distributed environment offers
    many benefits in terms of efficiency, data sharing, and fault tolerance, but due
    to the involvement of multiple unknown parties, it leads to trust and security

    flexible and easy lifestyle to the customers nowadays in the field of healthcare,
    grids, cities, agriculture, etc. Increasing demand of IoT also increases the requirement
    of automatic decision-making and intelligent machine to make accurate and efficient
    decision-making by processing the data collected through various sensors that
    can be achieved by ML algorithms. IoT network uses resource-constrained devices
    with smaller memory and smaller computation power that leads to the usage of cloud-based
    infrastructure for processing of data on cloud-based environment. Various machine
    learning techniques can be used to train the data collected by various sensors
    to offer intelligence to machines for automatic decision-making. In the area of
    healthcare, supply chain management, cities, agriculture, etc., many latency-sensitive
    applications ask for higher bandwidth which can be achieved by 5G network. As
    seen in the above sections, machine leaning models which use the same set of parameters
    for training and testing are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can be attempted
    by changing the parameter values. Moreover, privacy and lack of control are the
    major issues in the cloud-based environment. Blockchain is the promising solution
    which offers security in terms of integrity and transparency. Figure [13.19](#Fig19)

    raw data set which in turn affects the decision-making process [[10](#CR10)].
    It is employed for the discovery of new information and patterns hidden inside
    that large data set by including the use of the intersection of artificial intelligence
    (AI), ML, and statistical analysis as shown in Fig. [14.2](#Fig2). It is considered
    as a field which is a combined form of computer science and statistics with the

    some features require improvement, they are recognized and incorporated for a
    better design for the future. Machine learning utilizes computational algorithms
    to do core work for making decisions [[1](#CR1)]. Also, the variables, features,

    control them. Machine learning is accommodated to serve in 5G networks as it needs
    large volumes of data batches to foretell the accuracy of the activity. Machine
    learning seems to be a necessary component of any networking system as it is more
    complex than the few initial network generation. It works at higher frequencies,
    offers more elaborate configurations, and operates more advanced connectivity
    devices. The MIMO antennas which stand for multiple inputs multiple outputs used
    by 5G networks can manage multiplied data “communications” simultaneously across
    the same data signal [[6](#CR6)].

    the ideology of virtualization or network slicing. Network slicing refers to the
    usage of a single shared network with parallel running multiple virtualized networks.
    For example, firms can run a single network slice to lower the delay in the system
    that requires higher reliability; on this particular device, the employee traffic
    is handled by another slice. A 5G network-stimulated car has one network slice
    for the scenarios like autonomous driving facility and other slices for other
    functions and a different slice for the car features like radio, navigation system,
    and AC. Installing network slices is confined on a 5G network as there is a requirement
    of manual configuration. ML and AI will aid this service and find a way to reduce
    the complexity of the systems. This will assure that all information exchange
    is routed based on the need of the device and ensures the configuration settings
    to be appropriate.

    of data from different resources which in result has led to the growth of big
    data. Big data refers to a large and complex set of data that can be present in
    any format, and the analysis of such data is called big data analytics [[17](#CR17),
    [18](#CR18)]. Big data and DM are two unique things; while the two of them identify

    in Excel sheets which are too huge to possibly be dealt with without any problem).

    can be referred to as the quantity of data that is generated every day by various
    sources around us, while velocity means the amount of development and in what
    speed the data is accumulated for analysis. Variety is responsible for the flow
    of information or data which is structured, unstructured, semi-structured, etc.
    The not so popular V, that is, veracity, which comes fourth is actually the possibility
    and liability. The major aim is to successfully achieve and follow these 4Vs as
    shown in Fig. [14.4](#Fig4). Big data analytics has become such an important aspect
    because all the IT and computer industries are producing a huge amount of data
    that can only be taken in use after its analysis as that all information present
    in the form of big data is not necessarily required for analysis or decision-making

    accuracy were the main concerns that were faced [[19](#CR19), [20](#CR20)]. The
    major issue in the analysis of big data is the deficiency of coordinated communication
    between database systems and analytic tools. The first challenge for big data
    analysis is the unavailability of storage methods which can be due to the increased
    speed of input/output. In such scenarios, the data approachability should be the
    main concern for better representation. In earlier times, hard drives were used
    to store the data, but it became steady and became less reliable due to the random
    input/output production. To avoid this problem, the idea of solid-state drive
    (SSD) was introduced.

    insufficient time whenever dealing with high-dimensional data. The only solution
    possible in such situation is to shift the attention to designing storage systems
    and to use appropriate big data analysis tools which can guarantee the result
    when the data comes from multiple sources.

    IoT to increase the potential of the decision-making process. The most important
    feature of IoT that should be taken care of is the examination of information
    related to “connected things.” Big data analytics with the integration of IoT
    aims at filtering a large set of data on the fly and storing it using diverse
    storage methods/technologies. It is well known that most of the data collected
    are unstructured as it is collected directly from web-enabled “things”; thus,
    big data usage becomes necessary to perform rapid analytics with large data to
    permit organizations to obtain fast intuitions; they can build speedy decisions
    that can interrelate with both humans and virtual devices. The incorporation of
    IoT and big data analysis allows sensing and triggering devices that in turn provide

    way of opportunity for each other. For example, the deployment of IoT has displayed
    an increase in the amount of raw data generated and, thus, offers chance of development.
    The advantages of this interaction don’t end here; the application of big data
    technologies in IoT also facilitates speed to the research and business-related

    interlink age of devices such as CCTV cameras, traffic lights, and smart home
    devices which produces the data in different formats. The second step involves
    the generation of “big data” that are based on their characteristics (3Vs) velocity,

    relationships among different IoT levels, such as traffic, smart home, transportation,
    and smart health. On the other hand, the architecture for big data provides an
    idea of data abstraction. There are various kinds of architectures depending upon
    its application. For example, there is an IoT architecture of IoT associated with
    cloud computing at the center, and it represents a model of end-to-end interconnection
    among shareholders in a special kind of framework also known as cloud-centric
    IoT framework which leads to proper comparison with the suggested or default IoT
    architecture [[25](#CR25)]. The architecture can be only accomplished by logical
    pervasive recognition, data analytics, and proper representation of information

    (MEC). The big data at rest and the data in motion can come into reality due to
    the ability of 5G to aid gigantic connectivity over multiple devices which is
    further supported by the distributed computer architectures. It also produces
    the potential to convert big data into real-time insights and allows interaction
    with intelligence. Big data analytics plays a dual role in 5G. While, on the one
    hand, analytics resume to help diverse business applications of 5G webs, on the
    other hand, it also plays an important role in the roll-out of 5G network operations.
    Data analytics is compatible with 5G technology systems.

    mechanism by anticipating the approval distribution of the data in 5G networks.
    It is believed that this method can enable the structured usage of network resources
    and return a better experience for users. The first task is accumulating the raw
    data, i.e., the user traffic, and then the big data program plays a role in predicting
    the customer requests by pulling out the useful data, like Location Area Code,
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Tunnel Endpoint Identifier TEID and (TEID)-DATA to
    control the data levels. The content popularity can be achieved by the information
    collected from the collected raw data. This task has been experimentally tested
    on 16 base stations, as part of an operation of network, and it successfully resulted
    in complete request results and 98% backhaul offloading [[30](#CR30)].

    of the healthcare industry. Patient monitoring and sensors with the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have opened up new opportunities and chances in the healthcare
    industry. Wireless body area network (WBAN) is one of the subsets in the IoT healthcare
    trend. WBAN offers many assuring new applications in the IoT healthcare industry,
    including home/healthcare and remote health monitoring, and offers the increase
    of freedom of movement healthcare. Upon freedom, WBAN can take real-time measurements
    of vital indicators such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, respiration,
    blood pressure, temperature, and many more. All the collected data from the WBAN
    will be transmitted using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to a master device (it can be a personal
    computer, laptop, or mobile phone) directly toward the healthcare providers. Time-consuming
    doctor’s appointments can be reduced by this remote patient monitoring (RPM).
    Thus, it permits patients to go about their regular lives more freely.

    their health management tracker. By 2021, this number is estimated to grow up
    to 50.2 million patients. Various smart healthcare devices with the RPM monitoring
    have been produced nowadays such as monitoring chronic diseases [[1](#CR1)], high
    ventricular rates [[2](#CR2)], automatic pacemaker [[3](#CR3)], glycemic control
    for diabetes patient [[4](#CR4)], vital signs monitoring on general surgery wards
    [[5](#CR5)], implanted cardioverter defibrillators [[6](#CR6)], knee arthroplasty
    [[7](#CR7)], deteriorating patients [[8](#CR8)], chronic disease [[9](#CR9)],
    etc. This chapter focuses on autism with RPM for personalized home intervention.
    These smart secure telerehabilitation apps offer online rehabilitation (known
    as telerehabilitation) for self-autism intervention. Besides, patients and medical
    professionals (including therapists, doctors, and psychologists) will receive
    notifications regarding medical interventions and real-time patient monitoring.
    All collected data from the RPM must be accumulated, systematized, and managed
    together in order to instruct combined health management. However, these apps
    still suffer with the issues of security of the medical transmission data.

    reason in government law to ensure Protected Health Information (PHI) transmission
    [[10](#CR10)]. Therefore, there is a need to a new way to protect and preserve
    patient data privacy and their electronic health records (EHRs). This includes
    protecting the integrity among the patients and therapist and securing all the
    electronic treatment and services, besides maintaining all the manageable and
    transferable data timely. Therefore, this chapter highlights these concerns by
    integrating WBAN systems with Autism Telerehabilitation Apps (ATA) using a blockchain.
    Blockchain generates an immutable log for every connection between the WBAN devices
    and the autism therapist for a distributed data processing service. With this
    proposed system, all the patient monitoring, therapist notification, and immutable
    ledger are all secured and precise. The smart contract from blockchain reacts
    an innovator approach that consents healthcare contributors while simply automating
    the autism notifications from multiple devices using ATA.

    and limited attentions and dissimilarity in societal communication and social
    interaction. Roughly 1 in 59 children is detected with autism spectrum disorder
    (ASD) since 2018\. Based on the previous research, almost 50% of children with
    autism can catch up to their colleagues if they can obtain intensive behavioral
    treatment at an early age. ATA is built for Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA)’s
    Psychology and Rehabilitation Centre in line with the UniSZA’s aspiration to help
    the autism kids. This proposed system offers parents with a set of questionnaires
    detecting early ASD among kids using fuzzy rule-based techniques, besides offering
    automated and computerized managements based on the capacity taken by the devices.
    Thus, it would support health interventions and concurrent autistic children (patient)
    observing by sending notifications to patients and therapists (medical professionals).
    All the data transactions and notifications are secured with blockchain security.

    by chains [[11](#CR11)]. Satoshi Nakamoto first developed blockchain in 2008,
    where he used a hashcash-like process to add blocks to the chain without a consigned
    third party [[12](#CR12)]. Since 2008, blockchain technology has gone through
    three cohorts of development, which are Blocks 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\. Block 1.0 focuses
    on a currency where its successful project is Bitcoin. Block 2.0 covers loans,
    futures, bonds, smart contracts, mortgages, and cash transactions. Block 3.0 offers
    in wide application such as technology [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)], smart applications
    [[15](#CR15)], financial [[16](#CR16)], vehicles [[17](#CR17)], tourism [[18](#CR18)],
    and many more. Thus, it leads to three main layers in blockchain: peer-to-peer
    (P2P) network, databases, and applications. Besides, there are three categories
    of blockchain: public block, private block, and consortium block. Public block
    offers broad permissionless blockchain to initiate the transaction. Private block
    offers more strict permissioned blockchain and only involves members. Consortium
    block, quite similar to a public block, offers only for federated blockchain.'

    triggers using smart contracts. Smart contracts in ATA are used to collect all
    the autism data based on custom threshold amounts for each patient via WBAN devices.
    All the patient data are transferred based on set-up measurement and scale. This
    smart contract can identify if these data are higher or lower than the set-up
    measurement. Besides, it can give alert for appointments and therapy schedules,
    battery charging, etc. Moreover, it helps to secure activities among participating
    autistic over the public network. Any autism transaction (in nodes) among the
    participating autistics is added to the block only if they are agreed upon by
    the smart contracts. The smart contract also helps in maintaining privacy through
    permissioned anonymized accounts and consortium management. Only certified individuals
    can admittance the blockchain for block verification and inspection. To allow
    the patients to improve and manage their autism data and promote data transparency,
    each certified user will also have their personal account that can only be trailed
    by their discretion.

    and authenticity. It helps to maintain privacy through permissioned consortium
    management and anonymized accounts. Besides, blockchain provides high security
    and utilizes the consensus or agreement of nodes to authorize the additions of
    blocks to the chain. It operates as an all-purpose ledger for all transactions.
    Blockchain technology has facilitated in the improvement and efficacy of many
    industries. It can be used to document the procedures for each experience from
    its origin to the recent condition in an unalterable log. Blockchains can also
    implement smart contracts, which are pieces of code that can automatically execute
    based on predefined conditional triggers.

    One of the angles is on the diagnosis and treatment of autism health problems.
    Still, most of the researchers handle face-to-face therapy and intervention sessions.
    The new IR4.0 era has seen a dramatical change in therapy and intervention sessions
    toward technology-supported provision. For example, Williams et al. [[19](#CR19)]
    surveyed and produced new research directions on education, neurology, psychology,
    and critical disability studies using wearable technologies. Pérez-fuster et al.
    [[20](#CR20)] enhanced washing saucers skills and doing laundry skills for adults
    with ASD using digital technology (DT)-mediated intervention and compared them
    to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) intervention. So et al. [[21](#CR21)] examined whether
    the robot-based drama intermediation had better narrative capabilities and gestured
    for children with ASD than the other ASD who did not receive the intervention.
    Maskey et al. [[22](#CR22)] used computer-delivered virtual reality and flat-screen
    graded exposure with cognitive behavioral therapy in young people with ASD for
    the intervention of phobias and fears. Law et al. [[23](#CR23)] investigated whether
    intervention fidelity can be increased or not among special preschool educators
    using the developed initially mobile app for parent training. Koumpouros et al.
    [[24](#CR24)] reviewed the use of mobile and wearable technologies for ASD-related
    interventions and provided guidelines and insights to researchers to create more
    closer and useful to market products. Torrado et al. [[25](#CR25)] targeted to
    ease behavioral issues on mental health of individuals with ASD using a smartwatch
    system that infers outburst patterns from physiological signals, movement, and
    self-regulation strategies. Amiri et al. [[26](#CR26)] designed a modern smartwatch

    children using an open-source Web application named ABA programs with a discovering
    analytics tool for rehabilitation therapy for children with autism. This technology
    combined the ABA programs with a discovering analytics tool, an open-source Web
    application, and was executed for monitoring and teaching-learning for autistic
    children. Alzrayer et al. [[30](#CR30)] used an iPad loaded with Proloquo2Go to
    children with ASD and other evolving disabilities to determine the effectiveness
    of orderly instruction on teaching multistep requesting skills. Ahmed et al. [[31](#CR31)]
    notified the emergency alerts using temperature and pulse rate and detected coordinates
    of the autistic child using a wearable device. Gomez et al. [[32](#CR32)] addressed
    the self-regulation process of individuals with ASD using the potential of interventor
    smartwatches. Pain et al. [[33](#CR33)] designed, pilot tested, and reported multiple
    technologies on how educational technologies and therapeutics for ASD populations
    contributed to the dissemination of high standards of an iPad app design for very
    young children with ASD. The International Society for the Study of Trauma [[34](#CR34)]
    developed a useful robot-based approach to assess autism risk factors for diagnosing
    children with ASD.

    Revolution, starting from Healthcare 1.0, where, during this time, people were
    focusing more on public health solutions. Vaccines were created to solve primary
    endemic diseases. The appearance of broad production perceptions and technology
    brought healthcare to 2.0 [[35](#CR35)]. During this time, better hospitals and
    medical education were built, and more qualified doctors were produced for better
    treatment quality with better facilities. Next, Healthcare 3.0 came after the
    size of the computer shrunk. During this time, healthcare became faster and more
    efficient due to the fast development in information technology and computer.
    Now, we are facing a new era of Healthcare 4.0 where innovations lead to smart
    medicine. The emergence of artificial intelligence and IoT leads to smart healthcare.

- en: Due to the complexity and urgency in the Healthcare 4.0 environment, the necessity
    to propose an accurate method of answering healthcare security is vigorous and
    has expected important courtesy from scholars worldwide. Thus, much research has
    projected a variety of ways with different methodologies to solve uncertainty
    that arises during the evaluation process and model development. Zhang et al.
    [[36](#CR36)] increased robust and powerful blockchain technologies using AI-mediated
    data exchange on blockchains with artificial intelligence in real-world healthcare
    problems. Abujamra et al. [[37](#CR37)] improved the healthcare systems’ cost
    efficiencies that are associated with the information technology using blockchain
    system. Tanwar et al. [[38](#CR38)] developed an access control policy algorithm
    for enlightening data availability among healthcare providers. Farouk et al. [[39](#CR39)]
    discussed the future and vision opportunities of the blockchain platform for industrial
    healthcare. These blockchain technologies help increase the information security
    and manage and analyze the healthcare data while preserving the data’s security
    and privacy. Islam et al. [[40](#CR40)] collected health data from users using
    an uncrewed aerial vehicle and stored on the nearest server-based blockchain technology.
    Comput et al. [[41](#CR41)] proposed a smart healthcare system framework using
    blockchain technology to provide the system’s integrity and security, besides
    discovering the social and technology barriers by examining the user’s view and
    expert perception of the smart healthcare system. Hasselgren et al. [[42](#CR42)]
    enhanced data availability on healthcare providers using an access control policy
    algorithm and implemented the Hyperledger-based EHR sharing system using the concept
    of a chain code. Pandey et al. [[43](#CR43)] improved services and health education
    processes, health sciences, and healthcare using an assessed, synthesized, peer-reviewed,
    and systematically reviewed proposed blockchain technology. Mcghin et al. [[44](#CR44)]
    exploited a graph neural network (GNN) to manage users’ trust in malicious node
    detection. It prevents anonymous data sharing and storage without permission using
    smart contracts and blockchain technology. This smart contract and blockchain
    security are suitable for the smart healthcare system. Onik et al. [[45](#CR45)]
    provided a comprehensive explanation of blockchain challenges and opportunities
    in healthcare problems and solutions. Besides, it discussed the availability of
    its regulations and identified any major principles, plan, and prerequisites needed
    when developing the blockchain system. Tripathi et al. [[46](#CR46)] discovered
    the social and technological barriers of SHS in proving integrity in security
    and system. Brunese et al. [[47](#CR47)] proposed a magnetic resonance image to
    protect data and information exchanged within the hospital networks and then developed
    the blockchain technology to authenticate the transmitting data network, check
    the perform validation, and model the magnetic resonance images for automata radiometric
    validation. Islam et al. [[48](#CR48)] improved the accuracy in videos supporting
    the cloud computing and fog-based blockchain to recognize and monitor framework
    in e-healthcare services. Alam et al. [[49](#CR49)] highlighted many of the potential
    research opportunities in healthcare applications that used the blockchain experiments.
    Gordon and Catalini [[50](#CR50)] explored five mechanisms on how blockchain technology
    facilitated the transition which are (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation,
    (3) data liquidity, (4) patient, and (5) data immutability and next explored the
    barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability as an exciting
    trend in healthcare. Koshechkin et al. [[51](#CR51)] reviewed public healthcare
    among the Russian Federation community using the blockchain method. Zhang et al.
    [[52](#CR52)] focused on recognizing suitable blockchain method to be used in
    healthcare, offering a real case that accomplishes the blockchain method, assessing
    appropriate design architecture when operating this blockchain technology in healthcare
    cases.

    of the combination of videos, graphics, text, and games that are suitable for
    them to play and learn at the same time as their therapy session. These technology-supported
    interactive therapy modules can foster the skills of these autistic children.
    Based on the study by Stanford University School of Medicine, most autistic children
    excel in mathematical skills compared with non-autistic children in the same level
    of IQ range. Recovery in autistic disorder is rare but possible after a few years
    of regular therapeutic intervention. It is proved by Albert Einstein and Bill
    Gates, who were once diagnosed with autism disorder problem. Therefore, there
    is a need to secure an app that covers therapy strategies that can have positive
    impacts on an autistic’s socio-emotional well-being such as self-efficacy, social
    relationships, and identity.

    is equipped with several medical devices, such as thermometers, blood pressure
    monitors, and heartbeat rate sensors. This autistic child follows personalized
    autism home telerehabilitation using ATA guided by his/her parent and online therapist.
    The raw data is taken from both medical devices and ATA and sent to a UniSZA’s
    cloud data bank for aggregation and formatting. Once complete, the formatted information
    and customized threshold values are sent to the relevant smart contract for full
    analysis. The source of information fed in the Ethereum protocol to the smart
    contracts using ATA is stored in UniSZA’s cloud server. The smart contract will
    process and calculate the collected data and subject notifies to both the patient
    and therapist provider, and automated treatment instructions for the actuator
    nodes if desired.

    trace and trail the device transactions performed during the managing of the therapy
    session. Blockchain security not only provides privacy and security features but
    also provides accessibility of the features and seamless connectivity of the proposed
    smart apps. The blockchain security may secure the concept of central storage
    between medical devices and ATA. Figure [15.1](#Fig1) highlights the proposed
    personalized autism home intervention between sensors, smart devices, actuators,
    users, networks, and UniSZA’s cloud storage. A copy of blockchain secures all
    data from the medical devices and ATA act as nodes and each node. If the patients
    are first timers in ATA, they need to register; each node must verify the transaction.
    Each transaction is validated and each node is recorded and permitted to occur
    with a hash code in blockchain. Then, each of these nodes is copied and sent to
    the blockchain for further use and security. Blockchain-based IoT model helps
    secure all the storage with the data from medical sensors and ATA devices and
    deliver them to users upon requests with secure transactions.![../images/501059_1_En_15_Chapter/501059_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_15_Chapter/501059_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png)

    in the appilcation layer.

    of the proposed apps. It contains all the medical sensors, hardware devices, ATA,
    and the overall personalized autism home intervention system in two different
    parts: Part A and Part B. There are blood pressure monitors, thermometers, and
    heartbeat rate sensors connected to a raspberry pi microcontroller, a centralized
    device from Part A. Part B refers to an android application (ATA). All the sensor’s
    data are collected from Part A and transmitted to ATA (Part B) via Bluetooth or
    Wi-Fi connection. Then both data sensors and therapy data are transformed via
    Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to UniSZA’s cloud database. Next, Sect. [4](#Sec10) elaborates
    more details on how medical sensors and ATA are linked with blockchain and UniSZA’s
    storage database.![../images/501059_1_En_15_Chapter/501059_1_En_15_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_15_Chapter/501059_1_En_15_Fig3_HTML.png)'

    to monitor their blood pressure, temperature, and heartbeat rate which are connected
    to a raspberry pi microcontroller. The raw data from sensors are combined with
    the raw data taken from the ATA once all the therapy sessions complete. The raw
    data from ATA are taken from smart devices, either smartphones or tablets. Both
    data from sensors and smart devices are aligned and combined, for aggregation
    and formatting. For full investigation along with customized threshold values,
    the constructed information is sent to the relevant smart contract once it is
    completed.

- en: This chapter created a smart representation of all medical records taken from
    medical sensors and ATA and kept on the network within individual nodes using
    smart contracts from Ethereum. Contracts are built based on data integrity, record
    ownership, permissions, and metadata. Each contract carries out policies for state-transitioning
    functions and the legitimate transaction compelling data alternation. Smart contracts
    for ATA have been created by using autism medical workflows and then organizing
    data access authorization between the different individuals in the ATA ecosystem.
    All the important data need to grant a third party (in this case, an ATA admin)
    for viewing permission. All data authorization rules are embedded in smart contracts.
    These smart contracts also help in tracking all the autistic activities (including
    diagnosis and therapy) and the history of all patients. Besides, we need different
    permissions to retrieve all of the data. Smart contracts evaluated the retrieved
    data from the medical sensors and medical devices with Oracle’s help. Oracle is
    the smart device that interconnects straightly to the smart contracts in the Ethereum
    protocol. Patients’ identification card number is used as a unique id for the
    tracking activities. All the autism record data is securely stored in UniSZA’s
    database storage to preserve performance and security. If there are new therapy
    sessions or new news, the admin will add a new record and update in the ATA. All
    the information receives an automated notification and needs verification of the
    projected record before the data is rejected or accepted. This will help in creating
    high trust and better interaction between patients and therapists.

    technology as a ledger. Next, they are forwarded to an authorized EHR UniSZA’s
    storage database. EHR offers patient-centric privacy based on the readiness of
    patients. EHR enhances a vital role in minimizing patient operating costs and
    offers accurate and better healthcare intelligence and patient care quality. Once
    each patient finishes their therapy session, it automatically transmits therapist’s
    results through the smart contract system. All treatment records and commands
    are automatically recorded in a blockchain transaction. All the patient’s medical
    data and history are recorded with care using blockchain transactions connected
    to the EHR to supply data authentication. This authentication helped to detect
    any amendments to a patient’s EHR. The therapist must view and respond to the
    patient’s therapy results and refer the patients to the specialist when appropriate
    for further care. All the patient’s therapy data and information should be reported
    to the EHR. These data are collected and kept in an UniSZA’s local database with
    the specific rules where only authorized people can access to this record. The
    smart contract on Ethereum blockchain governs all the authorization. Here, blockchain
    helps to store, analyze, and gain health data without disturbing the privacy feature
    on online medical data. Otherwise, the therapist will be suggested directly to
    the hospital if any emergency occurs.

- en: Traditional intervention therapy sessions usually took place for 1 to 3 hours
    per week over 12 consecutive weeks or till the patients show any improvement.
    All sessions need to be seriously monitored by both patients and therapists and
    cannot be skipped. Otherwise it will interrupt the consequent sessions. Parents
    and autistic children usually take half an hour before and after to prepare for
    the therapy center. Using this ATA, parents and their autistic children will get
    ready anytime and anywhere for the therapy session without waiting for the therapist
    to respond. They can choose a suitable time to do this therapy, while the automated
    smart ATA system will monitor the therapy session. Besides, this ATA can reduce
    the error made by the human with the help from smart medical sensors and smart
    medical devices. Again, it can reduce the inaccurate interpretation of manually
    written prior authorization forms upon requests.

    patients, which presently consumes extensive amounts on manually sending and waiting
    process to the therapy center. Meanwhile, the traditional therapy sessions usually
    offered high fees compared to the online therapy session fees due to many side
    charges. This side charges for therapist salary, and rental spaces including center
    fixtures, equipment, inventory and data system, operating expenses and many more.
    For time issues, patients will be able to schedule their exact time to do the
    therapy session. Besides, therapists will be able to continue speedily with therapy
    remedy instead of having to stop their patient’s care while waiting in line for
    another patients’ therapy session.

- en: With this ATA, all patients’ data, identity, and therapy records are well kept
    and secured in UniSZA’s cloud database. Each patient has the authority to access
    their data. Nevertheless at the same time, the smart contacts help in the sharing
    of data by using secure data-sharing features. All the patients’ data collected
    from the sensors and medical devices has been protected against integrity and
    confidentiality attacks using a scalable and secure storage layer. Each patient
    has the authority to view their latest and previous data. In contrast, the healthcare
    professionals (including therapists and doctors) have the authority to edit the
    thresholds of their patients for the smart contracts. Moreover, each individual
    patient’s data are interlinked and independent with each other and well kept in
    the management layer. This management layer also processed and evaluated all the
    incoming and outgoing data using the data access gateway. This data access gateway
    is also able to manage all the heterogeneous patients’ data in the database engine.
    Although each patient can preview and access their own data, these smart contracts
    are still required to achieve a majority signatures (to make a block valid) from
    consortium members to prevent one partaker from controlling the ledger. The full
    observing privileges of the blockchain itself are inhibited to only permitted
    parties involved in HDG such as the government, the Ministry of Health, recognized
    medical officers, researchers, and others.

    between patients and medical officers. Our ATA system offers immutable and authenticated
    records of a patient’s observing to settle disputes or investigate. Anonymous
    addresses will protect the identity of patients; hence, no involvements can be
    made between patients and their data. Moreover, patients can associate remote
    monitoring actions straight to their medical records while preserving control
    and privacy.

- en: Using blockchain technology, our smart contract for ATA system has been developed
    to manage large-scale autism data (including patient data, diagnosis data, therapy,
    etc.) and streamline complex autism procedures. We proposed an advanced approach
    from autism record handling, affording interoperability, offering auditability,
    and easy accessibility via these smart contracts. Besides, this ATA system allows
    data sharing in safe mode sharing among permitted parties. Using blockchain technology,
    availability, security, privacy, and fine-grained control of EHR data access can
    be certified. The blockchain in this chapter helps to increase the healthcare
    practices and the patient managements. Our proposed ATA system uses blockchain-based
    smart contract technology to produce a secure, private, trustworthy, accessible
    environment for patients and healthcare providers. Patients will feel secure and
    safe especially in terms of data sharing with the therapist, doctors, researchers,
    and so on. This ATA system helps to solve concerns on data management, data security,
    and privacy, high administrative costs, and network security issues.

- en: Although blockchain helps increase privacy and security, there are some limitations
    on this ATA system. First is the size of blockchain. The size of blockchain is
    a very critical part, and data continues to grow for every transaction. The addition
    of new blocks data into old data records increased day by day upon the transaction,
    and this size will be accumulated each year. Once the addition of data is occurring
    based on the increase in the number of nodes, and this data is broadcasting to
    all nodes, then the cost for a bigger size database will also be increased, besides
    the increasing number of patients. New data space will be created once the new
    patients registered. The number of nodes is also growing once these patients continue
    the therapy transactions. Each of the nodes will be increased once they updated
    their therapy record. Besides, another challenge is to maintain security at every
    individual node. This security includes the data transaction and transmission
    between a patient’s medical sensors and patient’s smart devices as if used local
    or public Wi-Fi and relies on standard channel encryption. Moreover, other challenges
    are the management issues on verification of the next block due to multiple nodes
    from the smart devices’ broadcasting transactions. This could be resolved by producing
    large numbers of keys using a key management system. However, these limitations
    can still be overcome with future development and research.

- en: In this chapter, we described an ATA along with medical sensors in a WBAN for
    personalized autism home intervention using blockchain system-based smart contracts
    to perform log transaction metadata and real-time analysis. Blockchain-based smart
    contracts have highlighted security concerns about the logging and transfer of
    telerehabilitation of autistic data transactions. Once the patient is registered
    via the ATA system, this blockchain managed and executes smart contracts to evaluate
    all the information retrieved by each patient based on customized threshold values.
    Each transaction of recording details on the blockchain is verified, and the smart
    contract would spark signals for the patient and therapist for verification of
    EHRs. Blockchain has the potential to automate the delivery of health-related
    notifications in a compliant manner and improve security for personalized autism
    home intervention. It helps collect and manage patient data, clean this data,
    secure them using blockchain, handle big data, and come out with significant results.
    It also can trigger alerts for the unusual data taken. For future work, introducing
    anonymizers to increase patients’ privacy by the difficulty of linking transaction
    together. Lastly, applying new applications in other healthcare services such
    as mental health services, physiotherapists for stroke, and many more.
