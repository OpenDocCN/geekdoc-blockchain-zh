- en: Today is the era of Internet of things (IoT) in which all the devices are required
    to be connected through the Internet. Therefore, the connectivity is the requirement
    of this system [[1](#CR1)]. The mobile communication is one of the important communication
    media for this application. Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way we live
    and work. Their success and real value come from the establishment of services
    on top of the connected IoT devices. According to the Ericsson Mobility Report,
    there will be over 30 billion connected devices worldwide by 2023, of which around
    20 billion will be IoT related devices. Between 2017 and 2023, IoT devices are
    expected to increase at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 19%, driven by
    promising IoT use cases, like smart wearables, smart display, smart metering,
    robotic control/production automation, robotic surgery, autonomous driving car,
    and drone surveillance. These applications are usually integrated with wireless
    mobile communications [[2](#CR2)]. Currently, a number of smart IoT devices exploit
    cellular networks like 3G and 4G LTE to maintain their connectivity and their
    connection with the cloud data centers. As the skyrocketing of data produced by
    increasingly large number of IoT devices, there are several burning issues to
    be solved in the application environments. For example, the transmission latency
    and reliability of current cellular networks cannot be guaranteed, which in turn
    limits the effectiveness and feasibility of many emerging IoT applications, such
    as the autonomous driving car and robotic surgery, which ask for ultra-low latency
    and ultra-high reliability. 5G has been introduced with the capability of high
    throughput, low latency, high reliability, and increased scalability to enable
    massive number of devices with best QoS and QoE provision of ubiquitous connectivity
    solution to fulfill diversified IoT application requirements. This brings potentials
    to deploy more connected devices without worrying about an overcrowded network
    exacerbating existing issues. The high speed and reliable connectivity underpinned
    by 5G will create new possibilities for IoT services far beyond those available
    today. In addition, the enabling technologies of 5G, including functions virtualization
    and softwarization, software defined networking, massive MIMO (Multiple Input
    and Multiple Output), mobile/edge computing, and ultra-dense networks, have great
    potentials to usher in a new era of IoT, aiming to smoothly and flexibly support
    heterogeneous IoT services with distinct business characteristics under massive
    smart devices [[3](#CR3)]. Furthermore, IoT will bring a rich source of big data.
    The powerful role of big data analytics in 5G can undoubtedly benefit IoT advancement.
    This chapter is important to understand the concept of the Cloud Computing and
    Edge Standards, Security Fundamentals for 5G network, and other security measures.
    Then, we discussed Architecture of 5G-enabled IoT, Security Threats in 5G-Enabled
    IoT, Security Analysis, Privacy Threats in 5G-Enabled IoT, Security and Privacy
    Threats in Specific Domain, and Challenges and Opportunities [[4](#CR4)].

    It uses some standard mechanisms to access multiple configurable resources such
    as application, storage, networks, servers, and services. The first time cloud
    computing mentioned to the world is in a Compaq internal document as early as
    1996\. Several years later, cloud computing has come into actuality. In 2006,
    Amazon introduced the created Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [[6](#CR6)], which can
    support Amazon Web Services [[7](#CR7)]. Two years later, Google delivered the
    Google App Engine. In the 2010s, there are various Smarter Computing foundations
    appeared after IBM released IBM SmartCloud. In these smarter computing frameworks,
    cloud computing is a critical component. There are many service models for cloud
    computing; three models are accessible that are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    [[8](#CR8)], Platform as a Service (PaaS) [[9](#CR9)], and Software as a Service
    (SaaS) [[10](#CR10)]. Cloud computing has many advantages such as it enables to
    reduce the cost, it can be minimal effort to manage the infrastructure, and the
    users only need to pay when they need process and store data in a private or public
    cloud. It can adapt to fluctuations.

    cost of security and privacy threats is prohibitive. It is not only considered
    as potentially damaging to the monetary penalty, but also causing other more pressing
    issues such as consumer confidence, social trust, and personal safety. In this
    part, we mainly describe the difference between security and privacy. Security
    indicates against the unauthorized access of data. Privacy refers to protect the
    personal identification information. For example, a credit report agency enables
    to protect the customers’ personal information with security strategy, but the
    data scientist may still access this private information. Table [11.1](#Tab1)

    most attacks are via software. Therefore, clarifying the security threats of 5G-enabled
    IoT is necessary. Any IoT device’s integrity, authentication, and availability
    make software insecure. If the embedding system gets a malicious attack, IoT devices’
    information can be stolen, monitored, and damaged the software behavior. For the
    most popular operating systems, such as IOS and Android, the most substantial
    security threat is hacker attacked. The malicious attackers on smart mobile devices
    can gain access to enterprise and personal data. The most likely malicious attacks

    Man-in-the-Middle Attack and counterfeit attack still exist in this layer. Malicious
    attackers can control a section of the network and attack the networks. The unauthorized
    attacker can even fake the identification and communicate as normal and obtain
    more IoT users’ information. Also, IP theft is dangerous for network security.
    IPv4 and IPv6 are different versions of Internet Protocol in the network [[27](#CR27)].
    IPv6 as the upgraded version of IPv4 has some advantages such as better multicast
    routing, more simplistic header format, no more network address translation, etc.

    method cannot handle the high volume data traffic. For some shared cloud services,
    they do not provide enough security solution between users and applications. It
    will lead to another security threat when the users are sharing the resources.
    The system vulnerability can still exist in some complex cloud computing infrastructures.

    delicate data could be taken and manhandled by an attacker. Encryption is central
    to give sensitive information a fundamental degree of security. Without a doubt,
    it forestalls that communicated information can be captured and perused by aloof
    foes. Encoding the data may utilize computationally costly cryptographic techniques
    (for example, pairing based cryptography), which could not be executed by IoT
    gadget. So as to distinguish appropriate cryptographic ways to deal with the IoT,
    Malina et al. [[47](#CR47)] estimated the exhibition of the most utilized approach,
    (for example, RSA, secure hashing calculations, and AES) on probably the most
    widely recognized micro-controller preparing IoT gadgets. They found that while
    hashing and symmetric encoding activities take barely milliseconds and can run
    on extremely restricted micro-controllers, more grounded approaches, for example,
    RSA (by a 2048-bit private key), can cause delays into several milliseconds, which
    are unfortunate progressively to IoT applications. Handling of complex activities
    could be left to the cloud or to communication passages, bringing the decrease
    of the gadgets’ vitality utilization and calculation delays. Be that as it may,
    this technique requires trustful doors and secure correspondence among parties.
    A reasonable method to ensure identities (the two gadgets and clients) from being
    followed is concealing their genuine character by methods for pseudonyms. Anyway,
    as additionally recommended, when assailants listen to information bundle inside
    an adequately wide time window of perception, they may unveil genuine casualties

    yet a latent foe might misuse decoded data to recover relationship among brief
    extraordinary identifiers. Here we contend that despite the fact that the use
    of security approaches in structure and execution stages, security goals in the
    IoT could not be accomplished in light of its multifaceted nature. At that point,
    a far reaching comprehension of inspirations driving protection shortcomings and

    are also used by IoT devices. This offers global connectivity, security, and performance.
    Connectivity is the heart of IoT devices. With IoT devices having this level of

    future smart cities and economy. With 5G network, the smart grid era presents
    a multitude of promising applications, particularly demand response, advanced
    metering infrastructure (AMI), smart house, and so on. The smart grid brought
    about immense changes on how electricity is manufactured, communicated, or consumed.
    It associates a two-way information and power flow between the end users and the
    grid. Smart grid requires the expansion of communication infrastructures and legacy
    control, supporting the transmission and generation systems, the network boundaries,
    and the distribution networks to join the complete supply network of the industry.
    AMI is distributed globally to bridge the gap between end consumers and utilities,
    establishing two-way communication links that will allow automatic and efficient
    load management and the adaptation of auspicious smart grid solutions, particularly
    DER, V2G, DR programs, and so on.
  prefs: []

    to be susceptible to cyber-attacks from malicious attacks. For example, an attacker
    may initiate a DoS attack against the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
    (SCADA) system or parts of the AMI, like the neighborhood area networks (NAN),
    wide area network (WAN), and home area networks (HAN). The smart grid lays the
    foundation for a reasonable electricity marketplace. Hence, value integrity attacks
    can severely damage the product demand and supply balance, causing grid uncertainty,
    and can lead to an economy down. Subsequently this could damage the physical components
    of the grid or cause blackouts over a large geographic region.
  prefs: []

    load alteration or price integrity attacks, a secure network framework was proposed.
    The major part of this network architecture is the intrusion detection system

    of the AMI or a restricted number of links, that is, the attacker may direct the

    HANs and carry back the amount of electricity spent by these households.

    different circulation buses to notice any peculiarity in the system. Therefore,
    IDS screens and checks the demand and supply stability in real time and inspects
    if there is any unexpected rise in the request. This, in turn, can lead to load
    or price attacks in the AMI. Different IDS organizations could be developed for
    different components of an AMI; later these mechanisms can be integrated for additional
    performance enhancement. For example, when an abnormality is noticed in a certain
    place of the network, the corresponding IDS can communicate it to the IDSs to
    take suitable actions at the various layers of AMI, that is, WAN, NAN, and HAN.

    effectiveness in 5G use-cases equivalent to IoT scenarios, URLLC and mMTC, a lightweight
    authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher and an elliptic-curve
    cryptography (ECC)-based public-key cryptosystem are used as groundwork for this
    design.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to this approach, before the D2D communication is carried out, based
    on the 5G-AKA given by the 5G network, the identity of the user equipment (UE)
    is verified, and then a token is generated which is used as the key for the Elliptic
    Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The produced token could validate the
    authenticity of the associated UE in the link setup. This can be achieved without
    linking to the central network. Also in the secure data communication step, the
    encrypted communication is done through frivolous AEAD cipher; meanwhile, the
    authentication of the UE can be accomplished, and integrity/confidentiality of
    the data can be maintained in each transmission process.

    numerous simulated networks, and each slice signifies an autonomous virtualized
    end-to-end network. The allocate resources is collected from a physical network;
    this concept is similar to that of the city transportation system where the authors
    find many modes of transportation by allocating infrastructure resources like
    roads, rail tracks, etc. This, in turn, reduces latency and high reliability [[23](#CR23)].

    of advantages, security and privacy challenges are a major concern [[24](#CR24)].

    as it is challenging to maintain data security and privacy in the field of connectivity,
    computation, science, and 5G-enabled IoT. This chapter has discussed the overall

    the machine learning techniques’ pre-learning phase is performed along with training
    data, and few other databases have been used to check whether the model has been

    architecture will cause regularization, it means to remember the data pattern.
    In that case, the method is not effective because it has merely been memorized.
    It’s similar again for the learning cycle of humans as if we remember something,

    of automatic decision-making and intelligent machine to make accurate and efficient
    decision-making by processing the data collected through various sensors that
    can be achieved by ML algorithms. IoT network uses resource-constrained devices

    the ideology of virtualization or network slicing. Network slicing refers to the
    usage of a single shared network with parallel running multiple virtualized networks.
    For example, firms can run a single network slice to lower the delay in the system
    that requires higher reliability; on this particular device, the employee traffic
    is handled by another slice. A 5G network-stimulated car has one network slice
    for the scenarios like autonomous driving facility and other slices for other
    functions and a different slice for the car features like radio, navigation system,
    and AC. Installing network slices is confined on a 5G network as there is a requirement
    of manual configuration. ML and AI will aid this service and find a way to reduce
    the complexity of the systems. This will assure that all information exchange
    is routed based on the need of the device and ensures the configuration settings

    accuracy were the main concerns that were faced [[19](#CR19), [20](#CR20)]. The
    major issue in the analysis of big data is the deficiency of coordinated communication
    between database systems and analytic tools. The first challenge for big data
    analysis is the unavailability of storage methods which can be due to the increased
    speed of input/output. In such scenarios, the data approachability should be the
    main concern for better representation. In earlier times, hard drives were used
    to store the data, but it became steady and became less reliable due to the random
    input/output production. To avoid this problem, the idea of solid-state drive
    (SSD) was introduced.

    possible in such situation is to shift the attention to designing storage systems
    and to use appropriate big data analysis tools which can guarantee the result

- en: In the era of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (I.R. 4.0) escalates the advancement
    of the healthcare industry. Patient monitoring and sensors with the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have opened up new opportunities and chances in the healthcare
    industry. Wireless body area network (WBAN) is one of the subsets in the IoT healthcare
    trend. WBAN offers many assuring new applications in the IoT healthcare industry,
    including home/healthcare and remote health monitoring, and offers the increase
    of freedom of movement healthcare. Upon freedom, WBAN can take real-time measurements
    of vital indicators such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, respiration,
    blood pressure, temperature, and many more. All the collected data from the WBAN
    will be transmitted using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to a master device (it can be a personal
    computer, laptop, or mobile phone) directly toward the healthcare providers. Time-consuming
    doctor’s appointments can be reduced by this remote patient monitoring (RPM).
    Thus, it permits patients to go about their regular lives more freely.

- en: Since 2016, RPM is readily used as part of 7.1 million patients worldwide for
    their health management tracker. By 2021, this number is estimated to grow up
    to 50.2 million patients. Various smart healthcare devices with the RPM monitoring
    have been produced nowadays such as monitoring chronic diseases [[1](#CR1)], high
    ventricular rates [[2](#CR2)], automatic pacemaker [[3](#CR3)], glycemic control
    for diabetes patient [[4](#CR4)], vital signs monitoring on general surgery wards
    [[5](#CR5)], implanted cardioverter defibrillators [[6](#CR6)], knee arthroplasty
    [[7](#CR7)], deteriorating patients [[8](#CR8)], chronic disease [[9](#CR9)],
    etc. This chapter focuses on autism with RPM for personalized home intervention.
    These smart secure telerehabilitation apps offer online rehabilitation (known
    as telerehabilitation) for self-autism intervention. Besides, patients and medical
    professionals (including therapists, doctors, and psychologists) will receive
    notifications regarding medical interventions and real-time patient monitoring.
    All collected data from the RPM must be accumulated, systematized, and managed
    together in order to instruct combined health management. However, these apps
    still suffer with the issues of security of the medical transmission data.

    reason in government law to ensure Protected Health Information (PHI) transmission
    [[10](#CR10)]. Therefore, there is a need to a new way to protect and preserve
    patient data privacy and their electronic health records (EHRs). This includes
    protecting the integrity among the patients and therapist and securing all the
    electronic treatment and services, besides maintaining all the manageable and
    transferable data timely. Therefore, this chapter highlights these concerns by
    integrating WBAN systems with Autism Telerehabilitation Apps (ATA) using a blockchain.
    Blockchain generates an immutable log for every connection between the WBAN devices
    and the autism therapist for a distributed data processing service. With this
    proposed system, all the patient monitoring, therapist notification, and immutable
    ledger are all secured and precise. The smart contract from blockchain reacts
    an innovator approach that consents healthcare contributors while simply automating
    the autism notifications from multiple devices using ATA.

    and limited attentions and dissimilarity in societal communication and social
    interaction. Roughly 1 in 59 children is detected with autism spectrum disorder
    (ASD) since 2018\. Based on the previous research, almost 50% of children with
    autism can catch up to their colleagues if they can obtain intensive behavioral
    treatment at an early age. ATA is built for Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA)’s
    Psychology and Rehabilitation Centre in line with the UniSZA’s aspiration to help
    the autism kids. This proposed system offers parents with a set of questionnaires
    detecting early ASD among kids using fuzzy rule-based techniques, besides offering
    automated and computerized managements based on the capacity taken by the devices.
    Thus, it would support health interventions and concurrent autistic children (patient)
    observing by sending notifications to patients and therapists (medical professionals).
    All the data transactions and notifications are secured with blockchain security.

    by chains [[11](#CR11)]. Satoshi Nakamoto first developed blockchain in 2008,
    where he used a hashcash-like process to add blocks to the chain without a consigned
    third party [[12](#CR12)]. Since 2008, blockchain technology has gone through
    three cohorts of development, which are Blocks 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\. Block 1.0 focuses
    on a currency where its successful project is Bitcoin. Block 2.0 covers loans,
    futures, bonds, smart contracts, mortgages, and cash transactions. Block 3.0 offers
    in wide application such as technology [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)], smart applications
    [[15](#CR15)], financial [[16](#CR16)], vehicles [[17](#CR17)], tourism [[18](#CR18)],
    and many more. Thus, it leads to three main layers in blockchain: peer-to-peer
    (P2P) network, databases, and applications. Besides, there are three categories
    of blockchain: public block, private block, and consortium block. Public block
    offers broad permissionless blockchain to initiate the transaction. Private block
    offers more strict permissioned blockchain and only involves members. Consortium
    block, quite similar to a public block, offers only for federated blockchain.'

    triggers using smart contracts. Smart contracts in ATA are used to collect all
    the autism data based on custom threshold amounts for each patient via WBAN devices.
    All the patient data are transferred based on set-up measurement and scale. This
    smart contract can identify if these data are higher or lower than the set-up
    measurement. Besides, it can give alert for appointments and therapy schedules,
    battery charging, etc. Moreover, it helps to secure activities among participating
    autistic over the public network. Any autism transaction (in nodes) among the
    participating autistics is added to the block only if they are agreed upon by
    the smart contracts. The smart contract also helps in maintaining privacy through
    permissioned anonymized accounts and consortium management. Only certified individuals
    can admittance the blockchain for block verification and inspection. To allow
    the patients to improve and manage their autism data and promote data transparency,
    each certified user will also have their personal account that can only be trailed
    by their discretion.

    and authenticity. It helps to maintain privacy through permissioned consortium
    management and anonymized accounts. Besides, blockchain provides high security
    and utilizes the consensus or agreement of nodes to authorize the additions of
    blocks to the chain. It operates as an all-purpose ledger for all transactions.
    Blockchain technology has facilitated in the improvement and efficacy of many
    industries. It can be used to document the procedures for each experience from
    its origin to the recent condition in an unalterable log. Blockchains can also
    implement smart contracts, which are pieces of code that can automatically execute

    One of the angles is on the diagnosis and treatment of autism health problems.
    Still, most of the researchers handle face-to-face therapy and intervention sessions.
    The new IR4.0 era has seen a dramatical change in therapy and intervention sessions
    toward technology-supported provision. For example, Williams et al. [[19](#CR19)]
    surveyed and produced new research directions on education, neurology, psychology,

    the robot-based drama intermediation had better narrative capabilities and gestured
    for children with ASD than the other ASD who did not receive the intervention.
    Maskey et al. [[22](#CR22)] used computer-delivered virtual reality and flat-screen
    graded exposure with cognitive behavioral therapy in young people with ASD for
    the intervention of phobias and fears. Law et al. [[23](#CR23)] investigated whether
    intervention fidelity can be increased or not among special preschool educators
    using the developed initially mobile app for parent training. Koumpouros et al.
    [[24](#CR24)] reviewed the use of mobile and wearable technologies for ASD-related
    interventions and provided guidelines and insights to researchers to create more
    closer and useful to market products. Torrado et al. [[25](#CR25)] targeted to
    ease behavioral issues on mental health of individuals with ASD using a smartwatch
    system that infers outburst patterns from physiological signals, movement, and
    self-regulation strategies. Amiri et al. [[26](#CR26)] designed a modern smartwatch
    called WearSense assembled with IoT framework to detect stereotypic behaviors
    in children with ASD. Bittner et al. [[27](#CR27)] enlarged physiologic responses
    to physical activity using the proposed ExerciseBuddy application (EB app), a
    continuous measurement of heart rate and energy expenditure for children with
    ASD. Campbell et al. [[28](#CR28)] processed the implementation and improvement
    of a digital screening form in quality of care for children at risk for ASD. Artoni
    et al. [[29](#CR29)] implemented coaching and observing learning for autistic
    children using an open-source Web application named ABA programs with a discovering
    analytics tool for rehabilitation therapy for children with autism. This technology
    combined the ABA programs with a discovering analytics tool, an open-source Web
    application, and was executed for monitoring and teaching-learning for autistic
    children. Alzrayer et al. [[30](#CR30)] used an iPad loaded with Proloquo2Go to
    children with ASD and other evolving disabilities to determine the effectiveness
    of orderly instruction on teaching multistep requesting skills. Ahmed et al. [[31](#CR31)]
    notified the emergency alerts using temperature and pulse rate and detected coordinates
    of the autistic child using a wearable device. Gomez et al. [[32](#CR32)] addressed
    the self-regulation process of individuals with ASD using the potential of interventor
    smartwatches. Pain et al. [[33](#CR33)] designed, pilot tested, and reported multiple
    technologies on how educational technologies and therapeutics for ASD populations
    contributed to the dissemination of high standards of an iPad app design for very
    young children with ASD. The International Society for the Study of Trauma [[34](#CR34)]
    developed a useful robot-based approach to assess autism risk factors for diagnosing
    children with ASD.

    Revolution, starting from Healthcare 1.0, where, during this time, people were
    focusing more on public health solutions. Vaccines were created to solve primary
    endemic diseases. The appearance of broad production perceptions and technology
    brought healthcare to 2.0 [[35](#CR35)]. During this time, better hospitals and
    medical education were built, and more qualified doctors were produced for better
    treatment quality with better facilities. Next, Healthcare 3.0 came after the
    size of the computer shrunk. During this time, healthcare became faster and more
    efficient due to the fast development in information technology and computer.
    Now, we are facing a new era of Healthcare 4.0 where innovations lead to smart
    medicine. The emergence of artificial intelligence and IoT leads to smart healthcare.

    to propose an accurate method of answering healthcare security is vigorous and
    has expected important courtesy from scholars worldwide. Thus, much research has
    projected a variety of ways with different methodologies to solve uncertainty
    that arises during the evaluation process and model development. Zhang et al.

    an uncrewed aerial vehicle and stored on the nearest server-based blockchain technology.
    Comput et al. [[41](#CR41)] proposed a smart healthcare system framework using
    blockchain technology to provide the system’s integrity and security, besides
    discovering the social and technology barriers by examining the user’s view and
    expert perception of the smart healthcare system. Hasselgren et al. [[42](#CR42)]
    enhanced data availability on healthcare providers using an access control policy
    algorithm and implemented the Hyperledger-based EHR sharing system using the concept
    of a chain code. Pandey et al. [[43](#CR43)] improved services and health education
    processes, health sciences, and healthcare using an assessed, synthesized, peer-reviewed,
    and systematically reviewed proposed blockchain technology. Mcghin et al. [[44](#CR44)]
    exploited a graph neural network (GNN) to manage users’ trust in malicious node
    detection. It prevents anonymous data sharing and storage without permission using
    smart contracts and blockchain technology. This smart contract and blockchain
    security are suitable for the smart healthcare system. Onik et al. [[45](#CR45)]
    provided a comprehensive explanation of blockchain challenges and opportunities
    in healthcare problems and solutions. Besides, it discussed the availability of
    its regulations and identified any major principles, plan, and prerequisites needed
    when developing the blockchain system. Tripathi et al. [[46](#CR46)] discovered
    the social and technological barriers of SHS in proving integrity in security
    and system. Brunese et al. [[47](#CR47)] proposed a magnetic resonance image to
    protect data and information exchanged within the hospital networks and then developed
    the blockchain technology to authenticate the transmitting data network, check
    the perform validation, and model the magnetic resonance images for automata radiometric
    validation. Islam et al. [[48](#CR48)] improved the accuracy in videos supporting
    the cloud computing and fog-based blockchain to recognize and monitor framework
    in e-healthcare services. Alam et al. [[49](#CR49)] highlighted many of the potential

    facilitated the transition which are (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation,
    (3) data liquidity, (4) patient, and (5) data immutability and next explored the
    barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability as an exciting
    trend in healthcare. Koshechkin et al. [[51](#CR51)] reviewed public healthcare
    among the Russian Federation community using the blockchain method. Zhang et al.

    of the combination of videos, graphics, text, and games that are suitable for
    them to play and learn at the same time as their therapy session. These technology-supported
    interactive therapy modules can foster the skills of these autistic children.
    Based on the study by Stanford University School of Medicine, most autistic children
    excel in mathematical skills compared with non-autistic children in the same level
    of IQ range. Recovery in autistic disorder is rare but possible after a few years
    of regular therapeutic intervention. It is proved by Albert Einstein and Bill
    Gates, who were once diagnosed with autism disorder problem. Therefore, there
    is a need to secure an app that covers therapy strategies that can have positive
    impacts on an autistic’s socio-emotional well-being such as self-efficacy, social
    relationships, and identity.

    autism home telerehabilitation using ATA guided by his/her parent and online therapist.
    The raw data is taken from both medical devices and ATA and sent to a UniSZA’s
    cloud data bank for aggregation and formatting. Once complete, the formatted information
    and customized threshold values are sent to the relevant smart contract for full
    analysis. The source of information fed in the Ethereum protocol to the smart
    contracts using ATA is stored in UniSZA’s cloud server. The smart contract will

    session. Blockchain security not only provides privacy and security features but
    also provides accessibility of the features and seamless connectivity of the proposed
    smart apps. The blockchain security may secure the concept of central storage
    between medical devices and ATA. Figure [15.1](#Fig1) highlights the proposed
    personalized autism home intervention between sensors, smart devices, actuators,
    users, networks, and UniSZA’s cloud storage. A copy of blockchain secures all
    data from the medical devices and ATA act as nodes and each node. If the patients
    are first timers in ATA, they need to register; each node must verify the transaction.
    Each transaction is validated and each node is recorded and permitted to occur
    with a hash code in blockchain. Then, each of these nodes is copied and sent to
    the blockchain for further use and security. Blockchain-based IoT model helps
    secure all the storage with the data from medical sensors and ATA devices and
    deliver them to users upon requests with secure transactions.![../images/501059_1_En_15_Chapter/501059_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_15_Chapter/501059_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png)

    medical sensors and ATA and kept on the network within individual nodes using
    smart contracts from Ethereum. Contracts are built based on data integrity, record
    ownership, permissions, and metadata. Each contract carries out policies for state-transitioning
    functions and the legitimate transaction compelling data alternation. Smart contracts
    for ATA have been created by using autism medical workflows and then organizing
    data access authorization between the different individuals in the ATA ecosystem.
    All the important data need to grant a third party (in this case, an ATA admin)
    for viewing permission. All data authorization rules are embedded in smart contracts.
    These smart contracts also help in tracking all the autistic activities (including
    diagnosis and therapy) and the history of all patients. Besides, we need different
    permissions to retrieve all of the data. Smart contracts evaluated the retrieved
    data from the medical sensors and medical devices with Oracle’s help. Oracle is
    the smart device that interconnects straightly to the smart contracts in the Ethereum
    protocol. Patients’ identification card number is used as a unique id for the
    tracking activities. All the autism record data is securely stored in UniSZA’s
    database storage to preserve performance and security. If there are new therapy
    sessions or new news, the admin will add a new record and update in the ATA. All
    the information receives an automated notification and needs verification of the
    projected record before the data is rejected or accepted. This will help in creating
    high trust and better interaction between patients and therapists.

    technology as a ledger. Next, they are forwarded to an authorized EHR UniSZA’s
    storage database. EHR offers patient-centric privacy based on the readiness of
    patients. EHR enhances a vital role in minimizing patient operating costs and
    offers accurate and better healthcare intelligence and patient care quality. Once
    each patient finishes their therapy session, it automatically transmits therapist’s
    results through the smart contract system. All treatment records and commands
    are automatically recorded in a blockchain transaction. All the patient’s medical
    data and history are recorded with care using blockchain transactions connected
    to the EHR to supply data authentication. This authentication helped to detect
    any amendments to a patient’s EHR. The therapist must view and respond to the
    patient’s therapy results and refer the patients to the specialist when appropriate
    for further care. All the patient’s therapy data and information should be reported
    to the EHR. These data are collected and kept in an UniSZA’s local database with
    the specific rules where only authorized people can access to this record. The
    smart contract on Ethereum blockchain governs all the authorization. Here, blockchain
    helps to store, analyze, and gain health data without disturbing the privacy feature
    on online medical data. Otherwise, the therapist will be suggested directly to
    the hospital if any emergency occurs.

    to respond. They can choose a suitable time to do this therapy, while the automated
    smart ATA system will monitor the therapy session. Besides, this ATA can reduce
    the error made by the human with the help from smart medical sensors and smart
    medical devices. Again, it can reduce the inaccurate interpretation of manually
    written prior authorization forms upon requests.

- en: This proposed automated ATA process would ensure in noteworthy cost saving for
    patients, which presently consumes extensive amounts on manually sending and waiting
    process to the therapy center. Meanwhile, the traditional therapy sessions usually
    offered high fees compared to the online therapy session fees due to many side
    charges. This side charges for therapist salary, and rental spaces including center
    fixtures, equipment, inventory and data system, operating expenses and many more.
    For time issues, patients will be able to schedule their exact time to do the
    therapy session. Besides, therapists will be able to continue speedily with therapy
    remedy instead of having to stop their patient’s care while waiting in line for
    another patients’ therapy session.

- en: With this ATA, all patients’ data, identity, and therapy records are well kept
    and secured in UniSZA’s cloud database. Each patient has the authority to access
    their data. Nevertheless at the same time, the smart contacts help in the sharing
    of data by using secure data-sharing features. All the patients’ data collected
    from the sensors and medical devices has been protected against integrity and
    confidentiality attacks using a scalable and secure storage layer. Each patient
    has the authority to view their latest and previous data. In contrast, the healthcare
    professionals (including therapists and doctors) have the authority to edit the
    thresholds of their patients for the smart contracts. Moreover, each individual
    patient’s data are interlinked and independent with each other and well kept in
    the management layer. This management layer also processed and evaluated all the
    incoming and outgoing data using the data access gateway. This data access gateway
    is also able to manage all the heterogeneous patients’ data in the database engine.
    Although each patient can preview and access their own data, these smart contracts
    are still required to achieve a majority signatures (to make a block valid) from
    consortium members to prevent one partaker from controlling the ledger. The full
    observing privileges of the blockchain itself are inhibited to only permitted
    parties involved in HDG such as the government, the Ministry of Health, recognized
    medical officers, researchers, and others.

    between patients and medical officers. Our ATA system offers immutable and authenticated
    records of a patient’s observing to settle disputes or investigate. Anonymous
    addresses will protect the identity of patients; hence, no involvements can be
    made between patients and their data. Moreover, patients can associate remote
    monitoring actions straight to their medical records while preserving control
    and privacy.

- en: Using blockchain technology, our smart contract for ATA system has been developed
    to manage large-scale autism data (including patient data, diagnosis data, therapy,
    etc.) and streamline complex autism procedures. We proposed an advanced approach
    from autism record handling, affording interoperability, offering auditability,
    and easy accessibility via these smart contracts. Besides, this ATA system allows
    data sharing in safe mode sharing among permitted parties. Using blockchain technology,
    availability, security, privacy, and fine-grained control of EHR data access can
    be certified. The blockchain in this chapter helps to increase the healthcare
    practices and the patient managements. Our proposed ATA system uses blockchain-based
    smart contract technology to produce a secure, private, trustworthy, accessible
    environment for patients and healthcare providers. Patients will feel secure and
    safe especially in terms of data sharing with the therapist, doctors, researchers,
    and so on. This ATA system helps to solve concerns on data management, data security,
    and privacy, high administrative costs, and network security issues.

- en: Although blockchain helps increase privacy and security, there are some limitations
    on this ATA system. First is the size of blockchain. The size of blockchain is
    a very critical part, and data continues to grow for every transaction. The addition
    of new blocks data into old data records increased day by day upon the transaction,
    and this size will be accumulated each year. Once the addition of data is occurring
    based on the increase in the number of nodes, and this data is broadcasting to
    all nodes, then the cost for a bigger size database will also be increased, besides
    the increasing number of patients. New data space will be created once the new
    patients registered. The number of nodes is also growing once these patients continue
    the therapy transactions. Each of the nodes will be increased once they updated
    their therapy record. Besides, another challenge is to maintain security at every
    individual node. This security includes the data transaction and transmission
    between a patient’s medical sensors and patient’s smart devices as if used local
    or public Wi-Fi and relies on standard channel encryption. Moreover, other challenges
    are the management issues on verification of the next block due to multiple nodes
    from the smart devices’ broadcasting transactions. This could be resolved by producing
    large numbers of keys using a key management system. However, these limitations
    can still be overcome with future development and research.

- en: In this chapter, we described an ATA along with medical sensors in a WBAN for
    personalized autism home intervention using blockchain system-based smart contracts
    to perform log transaction metadata and real-time analysis. Blockchain-based smart
    contracts have highlighted security concerns about the logging and transfer of
    telerehabilitation of autistic data transactions. Once the patient is registered
    via the ATA system, this blockchain managed and executes smart contracts to evaluate
    all the information retrieved by each patient based on customized threshold values.
    Each transaction of recording details on the blockchain is verified, and the smart
    contract would spark signals for the patient and therapist for verification of
    EHRs. Blockchain has the potential to automate the delivery of health-related
    notifications in a compliant manner and improve security for personalized autism
    home intervention. It helps collect and manage patient data, clean this data,
    secure them using blockchain, handle big data, and come out with significant results.
    It also can trigger alerts for the unusual data taken. For future work, introducing
    anonymizers to increase patients’ privacy by the difficulty of linking transaction
    together. Lastly, applying new applications in other healthcare services such
    as mental health services, physiotherapists for stroke, and many more.
