- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that has enabled connection
    and communication between both virtual and physical objects, thereby improving
    our quality of life. The definition of IoT has evolved because of the convergence
    of numerous technologies such as embedded systems, commodity sensors, machine
    learning, and real-time analytics. IoT contributes towards the concept of connected
    vehicles, connected health, wearable technology, home automation, and appliances
    having remote monitoring capabilities. Even though these systems provide numerous
    advantages, the current centralized architecture brings forth numerous issues
    related to privacy, security, transparency, data integrity, and single point of
    failure. This, in turn, inhibits the future development of these IoT-based applications.
    Further, the radical digitization of industry coupled with the explosion of the
    Internet of Things (IoT) has set up a paradigm shift for industrial and manufacturing
    companies. Owing to these issues, it becomes necessary to integrate IoT with a
    distributed ledger technology. Blockchain technology, an immutable, shared, distributed
    ledger, is the most suitable choice for a variety of reasons. It stores the various
    transaction information in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and promotes information
    sharing among the network users. Owing to the fault tolerance capabilities, decentralized
    architecture and cryptographic security benefits such as authentication, data
    integrity, pseudonymous identities, security analysts and researchers consider
    blockchain to resolve privacy and security issues of IoT. The use of hash functions,
    timestamps, and sophisticated cryptographic algorithms in blockchain technology
    enables a secure computing environment and provides a tamper-proof ledger that
    can safeguard against possible attacks. Also, blockchain is used in numerous applications
    such as healthcare, intelligent transportation, supply chain management, identity
    management, voting, and maintaining government records. Due to these reasons,
    blockchain is considered the most disruptive and emerging future technology that
    will provide numerous opportunities to various industries. The emerging and promising
    state-of-the-art IoT and blockchain technology motivated us to propose this book,
    focusing on various aspects of IoT and blockchain systems like trust management,
    identity management, security threats, and access control and privacy. The book
    provides a comprehensive discussion on integrating the IoT system with blockchain
    technology, highlights the benefits of integration, and how blockchain technology
    resolves the issues of IoT systems.
