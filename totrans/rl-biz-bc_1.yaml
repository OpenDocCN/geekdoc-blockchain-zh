- en: On a recent flight to Dubai, David sat next to the CEO and chairman of a European
    company investing in blockchain. Over the eight hours, the CEO talked about transforming
    his family’s business from its twentieth-century origins as an industrial extractive
    company into a real estate developer, and then diversifying into cloud computing
    and now blockchain. This classic tale of creative destruction executed from inside
    an organization would seem, on the surface, the least likely move for a company
    like his, given its old money and old-world history.

- en: Formally, blockchain is a digital mechanism to create a distributed digital
    ledger on which two or more participants in a peer-to-peer network can exchange
    information and assets directly without the need for a trusted intermediary. The
    blockchain authenticates the participants and validates that they own the assets
    they want to exchange and that the transaction can take place. The blockchain
    records the information pertaining to the transaction on a digital ledger, a copy
    of which is independently held and updated by each participant in the network.
    Records are unchangeable, time-stamped, encrypted, and linked to each other in
    blocks; each block is a cluster of about two thousand transaction records grouped
    together.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en2) The ledger grows as participants transact.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en3)

    do business with an unknown partner located anywhere on the planet and trade any
    asset at any transaction size and not need a lawyer, a bank, an insurance company,

    promised to do. Such a solution vastly expands the range of assets that a business
    could trade. The arrangement also greatly increases who or what a business could
    directly trade with, without needing a third party (which would take a piece of

    In practice, decentralization means that no single entity controls all the computers

    unlike databases, blockchain is not a general store for information. Moreover,
    blockchain is immutable; it is not read, written, deleted, and changed the way
    that databases are. Most importantly, while a database can be distributed to various
    parties, only one central administrator controls it. In blockchain, administration

    single units. Individually, the units could be worth less than $0.01, but they

    potential to enable a wide range of new digital transactions. We created the Gartner
    blockchain spectrum ([figure 1-2](#fig1-2)) to illustrate the evolutionary path
    from the late 2000s, when many of blockchain’s enabling technologies reached mainstream
    awareness, to the current-day solutions that use only a few elements, to blockchain’s
    longer-term potential to enable microtransactions and unlock digital value flows.
    The spectrum reflects the experiences of organizations, including hundreds of
    our clients, engaged in the real-world development and application of blockchain
    technologies and design principles. Using the spectrum as our guiding framework
    for this book, we reveal how blockchain will evolve from what it is today to what
    it will be by 2030\. As seen in the figure, we expect this evolution to unwind
    in three phases.

    solutions use only three of the five elements—distribution, encryption, and immutability.

    an individual organization or to an industry. High-profile blockchain-inspired
    examples include a solution developed by Alibaba to facilitate tracking and tracing
    of food products, including milk products from Australia and New Zealand, and
    honey and wine from around the world. The global shipping and logistics company

    To benefit from blockchain solutions that go beyond the efficiency and process
    improvement focus in the blockchain-inspired phase, organizations must embrace
    decentralization, the most difficult of the five elements. Decentralization means
    that every full node in a blockchain network gets an equal vote on whether a participant
    and a transaction are valid, and every node has access to and full viewing rights
    over the ledger. Many business leaders are as troubled by the notion of full transparency
    (albeit in an encrypted form) as they are by letting lines of code execute business
    decisions, especially if such execution is outside their full control. Technology
    infrastructure providers and market intermediaries stoke those fears. These actors

- en: The very notion of the consensus-driven decision making that is inherent in
    the design of blockchain-complete and enhanced blockchain solutions is antithetical
    to most organizations and business leaders. You and other leaders might be tempted
    to simply focus your energy on the blockchain-inspired phase, hence limiting your
    movement to the lower edge of the northeast quadrant of [figure 1-3](#fig1-3)
    and ignoring the later phases of the spectrum.

- en: Yet we encourage you to keep the long view in mind as you experiment with blockchain-inspired
    solutions. We positioned movement along the decentralization continuum as a choice
    you face in an increasingly programmable world and society, but we don’t believe
    each of the available options is equally appealing. Millions if not billions of
    internet nodes and networked objects have spent the last two decades capturing
    communications; recording conversations; and keeping track of movements and transactions,
    relationships, objects used, and objects under consideration for billions of networked
    humans and organizations around the globe. Increasingly, the companies and governments
    that control this data are not just collecting but are also interpreting it, communicating
    it back, nudging people, and influencing behaviors.

    in the coming years. On the contrary, they are on a clear path toward continued
    adoption of AI and ongoing expansion of IoT to the point that nearly every asset,
    environment, process, and interaction will be fully programmable within just a
    few decades, just as Alan Turing described more than fifty years ago. You now
    need to decide what kind of a programmable society you want to live in. Do you
    want one in which interactions, transactions, and the data related to them are
    controlled by a small group? Or do you want a society with widespread access,
    privacy, engagement, and value exchange?

- en: 'Blockchain is a computerized way to allow two or more participants in a network
    to exchange assets without needing a third-party intermediary, which would take
    a share of the value. Blockchain as we define it includes five core elements:
    distribution, encryption, immutability, tokenization, and decentralization. Together,
    these elements create a trusted environment in which to create and share value.
    These elements are not equal in terms of how easy they are to implement. Decentralization
    is the most challenging, as it also requires a business-level embrace of some
    degree of decentralized governance.'
