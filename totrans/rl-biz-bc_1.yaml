    his family’s business from its twentieth-century origins as an industrial extractive
    company into a real estate developer, and then diversifying into cloud computing
    and now blockchain. This classic tale of creative destruction executed from inside
    an organization would seem, on the surface, the least likely move for a company

- en: Formally, blockchain is a digital mechanism to create a distributed digital
    ledger on which two or more participants in a peer-to-peer network can exchange
    information and assets directly without the need for a trusted intermediary. The
    blockchain authenticates the participants and validates that they own the assets
    they want to exchange and that the transaction can take place. The blockchain
    records the information pertaining to the transaction on a digital ledger, a copy
    of which is independently held and updated by each participant in the network.
    Records are unchangeable, time-stamped, encrypted, and linked to each other in
    blocks; each block is a cluster of about two thousand transaction records grouped
    together.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en2) The ledger grows as participants transact.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en3)

    do business with an unknown partner located anywhere on the planet and trade any
    asset at any transaction size and not need a lawyer, a bank, an insurance company,
    or any other intermediary making sure both of you follow through on what you’ve
    promised to do. Such a solution vastly expands the range of assets that a business
    could trade. The arrangement also greatly increases who or what a business could
    directly trade with, without needing a third party (which would take a piece of
    the value).

    through a period when opportunistic actors try to define the market in ambiguous
    or self-serving ways. The use of the word “database” to describe blockchain is
    an example of this. Blockchain *isn’t* a database. Although vendors sometimes
    falsely describe it as one, the mechanism has several key differences. For instance,
    unlike databases, blockchain is not a general store for information. Moreover,
    blockchain is immutable; it is not read, written, deleted, and changed the way
    that databases are. Most importantly, while a database can be distributed to various
    parties, only one central administrator controls it. In blockchain, administration
    is through consensus.[⁹](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en9) Central control is contradictory
    to the very idea of blockchain.

    transactions possible today with digital or digitalized assets. Digital transactions
    don’t have a minimum size the way transactions do in the analog world. Units of
    data, cryptocurrency, reward points, and pieces of an asset (as opposed to the
    whole) are just a few new forms of value that digitalization makes tradable in
    single units. Individually, the units could be worth less than $0.01, but they
    can be traded by the millions or trillions. The burgeoning trade in these digital

    points throughout this book. Suffice it to say for now that data is the anchor
    currency because of how customers leave behind a data trail, like Hansel and his
    breadcrumbs. Powerful market intermediaries such as large retailers, financial
    services firms, government agencies, and digital platforms can pick up this data
    essentially for free and analyze it to improve user experiences and to drive product
    development. Organizations that can capture plenty of data at very low cost and

    of leaving data behind as you search and interact with a person or an organization,
    the data related to both you and the other parties on a blockchain can, under
    specific design conditions, be kept under participant control and shared as needed
    for a transaction. This shift in control prevents a central actor from capturing
    an outsize share of value and ushering it off-chain or using undue influence to
    nudge customer behaviors in particular directions. In this way, blockchain also

    regulatory considerations and the propensity to deal with a limited set of known,
    and therefore trusted, participants.

    To benefit from blockchain solutions that go beyond the efficiency and process
    improvement focus in the blockchain-inspired phase, organizations must embrace
    decentralization, the most difficult of the five elements. Decentralization means
    that every full node in a blockchain network gets an equal vote on whether a participant
    and a transaction are valid, and every node has access to and full viewing rights
    over the ledger. Many business leaders are as troubled by the notion of full transparency
    (albeit in an encrypted form) as they are by letting lines of code execute business
    decisions, especially if such execution is outside their full control. Technology
    infrastructure providers and market intermediaries stoke those fears. These actors

    structure to full decentralization. The idea of a continuum is critical, since
    decentralization is itself a dynamic condition—even in blockchain. Some industries
    and corresponding businesses are highly centralized today as a function of their
    structure. Others are naturally more fragmented. Even given that variation, any
    significant movement along the *x*-axis is blockchain dependent, since organizations
    that want to digitally transform and operate under decentralized governance *need*
    blockchain or some other form of digital ledger technology to allow all economic
    participants, including autonomous things, to transact with each other and earn
    due economic returns. Only decentralization *enabled by blockchain* makes transactions
    without an intermediary possible in a networked environment.

    realistically limits an organization’s directional options to two: organizations
    will either move north to become more digital under centralized governance, or

- en: The prevailing emphasis for the past two decades has been to drive toward “digital
    transformation.” In terms of [figure 1-3](#fig1-3), the progression has moved
    organizations north from the lower left corner—where most business in most industries
    operate as relatively centralized and mostly analog—over the line into the upper
    left quadrant. While some legacy businesses have realized positive results from
    this approach, far more organizations struggle to realize value through the digital
    transformation of their current models.[^(17)](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en17) Legacy
    infrastructure, investments, processes, partners, organizational cultures, profit
    models, and other aspects of these businesses are a source of competitive advantage,
    but are also extremely difficult to adjust without risking critical relationships
    and current sources of income. Because digital native platforms do not have these
    limitations, they can grab territory in the north-west quadrant (digitally sophisticated,
    centralized business), and, with that position, draw in customers. A diverse and
    relevant product set, an intuitive user interface, uncomplicated payments, and
    convenient delivery cultivate customer loyalty, enabling further centralization.
    Nondigital native platforms vying for the same customers and using the same techniques
    lack the proficiency the native platforms enjoy.

    and will continue along the same trajectory they have followed for the past two
    decades under the control of a few large, digitally capable businesses (and government
    agencies) using the increasingly centralized infrastructure we rely on today.
    Allowing digitalization to progress in this way results in an outsized share of
    value accruing to a few powerful organizations—including large digital platforms,
    banks, insurers, telecommunications companies, logistics giants, and central governments.
    These organizations would have unlimited control over the data and value produced
    in a programmable world, allowing them to dictate the terms of how other businesses
    access markets and technology and how they benefit. Absolute control would enable
    these programmable entities to become even more centralized over time.

- en: Alternatively, organizations can choose a north-east trajectory to become more
    digital and more decentralized. A few companies have already decided to tackle
    the northeast quadrant to compete in their markets with relatively decentralized,
    digitally enabled business models. We say “relatively” because the multifaceted
    nature of business also means that a company can be quite centralized in some
    ways but decentralized in others. Some examples of companies embracing decentralization
    in aspects of their business or operating models include car-sharing providers
    like Zipcar, which enables decentralized car ownership, and LO3 Energy, which
    uses blockchain to support personal energy generation and exchange without the
    involvement of a centralized utility. Apparel brands such as Betabrand and Everybody
    World have open-source and crowdfunded product development models. And crowdfunding
    from the likes of Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and Ulule provides decentralized financing
    for independent ventures.[^(18)](../Text/notes.html#ch1-en18) These examples and
    dozens of others show how decentralization of certain operational functions can
    deliver value. The companies themselves may be small, but they are among the fastest-growing
    firms in their respective sectors.

    you face in an increasingly programmable world and society, but we don’t believe
    each of the available options is equally appealing. Millions if not billions of
    internet nodes and networked objects have spent the last two decades capturing
    communications; recording conversations; and keeping track of movements and transactions,
    relationships, objects used, and objects under consideration for billions of networked
    humans and organizations around the globe. Increasingly, the companies and governments
    that control this data are not just collecting but are also interpreting it, communicating
    it back, nudging people, and influencing behaviors.

    to exchange assets without needing a third-party intermediary, which would take
    a share of the value. Blockchain as we define it includes five core elements:
    distribution, encryption, immutability, tokenization, and decentralization. Together,
    these elements create a trusted environment in which to create and share value.
    These elements are not equal in terms of how easy they are to implement. Decentralization
    is the most challenging, as it also requires a business-level embrace of some
    degree of decentralized governance.'
