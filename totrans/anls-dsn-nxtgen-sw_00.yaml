    in the US, SSADM in the UK and Merise in France), they were intended to support
    the building of business applications which would last for a long time with minimum
    cost of maintenance. They were to ensure designs which would cope with the functional
    (the what) and non-functional (volume and performance) system requirements, which
    were supposed to stay as stable as possible. Data would be organized to represent
    required information according to well-defined data models which optimized data
    access and reduced required storage volumes. The famous relational data model
    imposed integrity constraints which were maintained on a permanent basis; and
    transactions were carefully controlled in order to avoid inconsistency in the
    event of hardware failure or performance bottleneck.

    and performance were built around invariants identified and defined by the analyst.

    lifecycle, conformance to requirements, and delivery on time and on budget.

    effectively deliver services when its number of users is small on each side, and
    their trading volumes are low. The initial cost to users of participating in the
    platform needs to reflect low startup value, even though this means that the platform
    operator might have to run at a loss until user revenues build up. But probably
    even more challenging is the problem of being able to maintain the same architecture

    cope with a latency of a few seconds or more, and technical applications that
    require real time operation with a latency in the low milliseconds range. To guarantee
    low latency, technical applications require real time loops that are painstakingly
    optimized by scrutinizing code to ensure that they deliver low latency response,
    whatever the circumstances. In business applications, response time for transactions
    was a focus of attention and was being guaranteed up to a certain number of users
    and a maximum volume of data.
  prefs: []

    impatient whatever the circumstances: they are not interested by how many users
    are connected, how much data needs to be accessed, or their network latency (which
    is most of the time dictated by the Internet where there is no guaranteed performance).
    The only “must” with digital applications is to offer the appropriate quality
    of service, user experience or “Digital moments”. These can be very obvious when
    streaming music or video—constant buffering and interruptions due to latency quickly
    render the experience unacceptable. Understanding Digital Moments in the context
    of things like ordering a car or reserving a hotel room requires more sophistication;
    and in the case of navigation operation in cars, it is very complex. The nature
    of the Digital moment is directly linked to the attention span of the consumer
    and the decisions they will be required to make. Failure to respect Digital moments
    is a fundamental reason for users to reject services on offer, and the matter
    should therefore be at the top of analysts’ and designers’ attention.'

    have forced analysts and developers to revisit the topic of data localization.
    The formerly sacrosanct principle of the data base community:*no redundancy* ,
    is now seriously challenged. From simple caching mechanisms used by content distribution
    networks such as Akamai (which stores copies of data close to where they are the
    most frequently used), we have progressed to redundancy by design. Instead of
    hitting the latency constraints of bringing data to processes, we have started
    to send processes to data (close to the place where it has been collected). We
    are experiencing edge computing combining with the internet of things to steadily
    create a world where most of the data will be stored at the edge and not centrally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the relaxation of the “no redundancy” principle comes the counter challenge
    of data consistency across all locations where data copies are stored. Requiring
    full consistency is very inefficient because it requires that every update in
    a given location be replicated in every other location before proceeding to the
    next update.

    mode; for latency reason when performance at the edge is required; and finally,
    for back-up recovery. It is little surprise that the volume of data to be stored
    is doubling every 18 months. It remains to be seen how such data growth will be

    adding new features and correcting bugs. The most advanced platforms have daily
    scrums and the question of new feature releases is like taking the bus, if you
    don’t get on this bus, there be another along in the next 5 min. This offers the
    ability to incrementally build platform functionality and, in case of problems,

    rejection by the platform operator.

    and practitioners with a guide to building new architectures in response to the
    power provided by 5G mobile communications. Indeed, 5G will initiate abilities
    to communicate in a wireless world, allowing Internet of Things (IoT) to become
    the “data aggregator” for massive amounts of information that will be collected
    over distributed networks powered by the internet. Unfortunately, the speed of
    5G and the proliferation of IoT creates the need for better security. That is,
    the ability to collect an abundance of valuable information comes at a price.
    Simply put, our existing architectures are not capable of providing the necessary
    security to protect the valuable data that we can use to explore new ways of using
    artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). As a result, new architectures
    must be developed that use the ledger-based approaches offered by blockchain design.
    Further, these new architectures will also need a new approach in the ways data
    is stored across complex mobile networks, which has given birth to advanced capabilities

    span everywhere, companies need to take on the re-architecting of their legacy
    systems. It seems overwhelming to think that 50 years of developing products and
    services under a specific development mentality can now somehow be changed in
    a short amount of time. Nevertheless, my epistemology on this issue is very basic,
    redo your systems or perish as a business. While this may seem harsh and one-dimensional,
    I believe the costs for not moving quickly will dramatically affect the ability
    for any organization to compete in the digital age. This book provides the guidance
    from both a technical perspective and a management approach. My philosophy, which
    is shared by others, is that it is impossible to redo all existing legacy systems
    within most organizations. I, as others, offer a “complimentary approach” that
    suggests that businesses continue to provide the backend services using their
    legacy products but need to build new ones that offer the new services that are
    required in a consumer-driven world—a world which I coin as the “consumerization
    of technology.” We cannot expect organizations to cure 50 years of bad architecture
    overnight. We experienced the challenges and costs of moving to integrating systems
    using enterprise resource planning (ERP) products that took 20 years to complete.
    I believe the new migration to mobility will take even longer and at a much higher
    cost. So we must transform old systems while building new ones while ensuring
    the connectivity between them. That is the objective of the*Next Generation of

    architectures. There is no question that this new digital era provides more user
    friendly and user intuitive applications, but make no mistake, the technology
    is more complex and advanced as ever. Thus, we need technically qualified leaders
    who understand how to build these new systems to support a digital strategy. While
    cultural transformation is necessary, we must acknowledge that the successful
    digital-born companies have built backend and front-end systems that operate seamlessly.
    So, who in the organization can we call our most valuable player (MVP)? My vote
    in this book is the*Analyst* , the individual who gives you the most payback for
    the investment. Analysts typically can provide the technical architecture design,
    usually know their legacy systems, and can perform the necessary project management.
    All these functions can drive these new systems while helping evolve a new digital-based
    culture. While we need executives, users, and consumers to be fundamentally engaged
    in all aspects of the transformation, the analyst represents the one role that
    can be the main director of its success. Therefore, technology executives need
    to expand the role of the analyst and understand the importance of the position.
