- en: With the launching of JPMCoin in the early days of 2019 there was a renewed
    discussion and debate around both the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    at large as well as the implications that such a launch means for existing options
    and companies already operating within the broader space. There was an abundant
    amount of discussion and analysis in the space following the announcement of the
    new token as well as the blockchain it operates on, but regardless of specifics
    that have been discussed, it does appear that there are a few core themes and
    topics that are driving this and other conversations.

  zh: 2019年初，JPMCoin的推出重新引发了人们对区块链和加密货币的未来的讨论和辩论，以及这样一个推出对已经在更广泛领域运营的公司和现有选择的影响。在新代币及其所在的区块链宣布后，人们在这个领域进行了大量的讨论和分析，但不管已经讨论的具体情况如何，似乎都有一些核心主题和话题正在推动这种和其他对话。
- en: First, and despite the countless headlines that heralded the launching of a
    new cryptocurrency by a large financial institution, in this case JP Morgan, the
    underlying reality is that this token – JPMcoin – is not a cryptocurrency by the
    definitions that have already been established. Rather, these more recent iterations
    and applications seem to instead build existing stablecoins, decentralized coins,
    and other banking affiliated cryptocurrencies and coins such as XRP (Roberts [2019](#CR6)).
    Instead of being a decentralized and distributed cryptocurrency or token operating
    outside or in parallel to the current financial system, this coin (or token),
    is controlled entirely by JP Morgan. In addition, and instead of operating on
    decentralized blockchain platform such as the bitcoin blockchain or etherum blockchain,
    the JPM Coin runs on a private permissioned blockchain. Seemingly against the
    up front promises and expectations associated with blockchain in general, this
    shift toward more of a private or permissioned blockchain platform is seemingly
    epitomized by the launch of this system. In addition to this change, this launch
    also leads to another question that should be considered as platforms like this
    continue to enter the marketplace.

  zh: 首先，尽管无数的头条报道宣称大型金融机构推出了新的加密货币，比如摩根大通的这个代币——JPMCoin，但事实上，根本现实是，根据已经确立的定义，这个代币并不是加密货币。最近的这些版本和应用似乎更多是构建现有的稳定币、去中心化币以及其他与银行相关的加密货币，比如XRP（Roberts
    [2019](#CR6)）。与其成为在当前金融体系外部或平行运行的去中心化和分布式加密货币或代币不同，这个代币（或代币）完全由摩根大通控制。此外，与其在比特币区块链或以太坊区块链等去中心化区块链平台上运行相反，JPM
    Coin运行在一个私有的许可区块链上。与总体来说区块链的直接承诺和期望相矛盾的是，这种转向更为私有或受许可的区块链平台的变化似乎正是这个系统的推出的缩影。除了这一变化，这次推出也带来了另一个应该考虑的问题，作为这样的平台继续进入市场。
- en: Second, and something that strikes to the core of the idea of any blockchain
    or other financial system or platform is who is going to use blockchain systems.
    As discussed throughout this text, the public and virtually completely open sourced
    blockchain platforms do not appear to be well positioned for enterprise adoption.
    Centralized, private, or public permissioned blockchain models do seems to have
    more potential for greater enterprise and corporate adoption, but this can present
    the following contradiction. Forming such a private or centralized blockchain
    model means that, by default, the total member of network participants is going
    to be capped. This is no different for the blockchain model underpinning the JPM
    Coin. As of this writing, in early to the middle or 2019, the only proposed customers
    and clients of the JPM Coin and blockchain platform are the enterprise and commercial
    clients and customers already connected to JP Morgan in any case.

  zh: 其次，对于任何区块链或其他金融系统或平台的核心思想来说，谁将使用区块链系统是至关重要的。正如本文所讨论的，公开且几乎完全开源的区块链平台似乎并不适合企业采用。中心化、私有或公共许可的区块链模型似乎更有潜力被企业和公司采用，但这也带来了以下矛盾。构建这样一个私有或中心化的区块链模型意味着，从根本上讲，网络参与者的总数将受到限制。这对支持JPM
    Coin的区块链模型也是一样的。截至本文撰写时，即2019年初到中期，JPM Coin和区块链平台唯一提议的客户和客户端是无论如何已经与JP摩根联系在一起的企业和商业客户。
- en: This might seem like a basic or anecdotal point to analyze, but means that despite
    the hype, excitement, and discussion around this roll out and implementation that
    the market ceiling for this product and service remain relatively low. More to
    the point, and the true conversation and debate in the marketplace, is the competition
    and challenge that such a model poses to an organization like Ripple and the cryptocurrency
    XRP that functions and runs on the Ripple blockchain. As of the of the initial
    launch there were immediately critiques and comments from both sides of the topic
    as to whether or not this was a viable business idea or simply another sizzle
    first attempt to capture mind share or market position. That said, and acknowledging
    the fact that it is still early days in the conversation around JPM Coin and the
    underlying blockchain that it runs on, there are a few key considerations that
    should be part of an analysis moving forward.

  zh: 这可能看起来像是一个基本或趣闻的分析点，但这意味着尽管吹捧、兴奋和讨论围绕这一推出和实施，但该产品和服务的市场上限仍然相对较低。更重要的是，在市场上真正的对话和辩论是，这样一个模型对类似瑞波和在瑞波区块链上运行的加密货币XRP这样的组织构成的竞争和挑战。在最初推出之时，立即有来自两方的批评和评论，关于这是否是一个可行的商业主意，还是只是另一个为了占领市场份额或市场地位的冒头尝试。尽管如此，要承认的是，围绕JPM
    Coin和其基础区块链的讨论仍处于早期阶段，有一些关键考虑因素应成为未来分析的一部分。
- en: First, and something that cannot be overstated is that the blockchain model
    and JPM Coin that runs on this model is a centralized, private, and permission
    blockchain, and is not open to clients and customers outside of existing JP Morgan
    clients. Contrasting this to Ripple, which has made a concerted effort to attract
    large financial institutions and banks to join the network and begin using the
    bridge currency of XRP to assist in settling transactions, the difference is readily
    apparent. This closed and self contained system will, invariably, limit the potential
    users and applications for JPM Coin at the beginning, but that does mean that
    the system and model will be deprived of scale. With trillions of dollars passing
    through the payment processing and transaction settling business the implementation
    of this system – even if only utilized by JP Morgan clients and customers – will
    have profound ripple effects. That aside, let’s take a look at some of the key
    accounting and financial reporting considerations that are sure to arise as JPM
    Coin and, potentially, other similar models become more prevalent in the marketplace.
  id: totrans-9

  zh: 首先，一个无法过分强调的事情是，运行在这种模型上的区块链模型和JPM币是集中化的、私有的和许可的区块链，不对现有JP摩根客户以外的客户开放。与此形成对比的是瑞波，后者已经在努力吸引大型金融机构和银行加入网络并开始使用XRP的桥梁货币来协助结算交易，区别一目了然。这种封闭和自包含的系统将不可避免地限制JPM币在初期的潜在用户和应用，但这并不意味着系统和模型将失去规模。随着数万亿美元通过支付处理和交易结算业务，即使只有JP摩根的客户和客户使用，这个系统的实施也将产生深远的连锁效应。除此之外，让我们来看看在JPM币和潜在的其他类似模型在市场上变得更加普遍时，一些关键的会计和财务报告考虑因素。
- en: The first place to begin any related accounting analysis would seem to be around
    just how these different coins or tokens are going to be classified from an accounting
    perspective. Such a dialogue reveals, however, just how ambiguous and confusing
    the accounting rules and regulations continue to be for this space. In addition
    to the differences that are going to arise in any case, the accounting rules and
    guidelines for different types of cryptoassets continue to be represent a plethora
    of options. Drilling down, what this means for practitioners is that – for now
    at least – there are a number of options that organizations can embrace as long
    as they are also able to defend and justify these decisions.

  zh: 开始任何相关会计分析的地方似乎应该是关于这些不同的代币或硬币将如何从会计角度分类。然而，这样的对话揭示了会计规则和法规在这个领域继续是多么模糊和混乱。除了不可避免地会引发的差异外，不同类型的加密资产的会计规则和准则继续代表着多种选择。深入思考，对从业者来说，这意味着目前至少有一些组织可以接受的选项，只要它们能够为这些决定辩护和证明。
- en: Second, the internal control conversation continues to become more important
    as blockchains and different types of cryptoassets become increasingly integrated
    into the broader financial market conversation. In addition to the traditional
    controls over the storage, communication, and reporting of information to both
    internal and external stakeholders, such integration also points to emerging areas
    of concern and consideration. In essence, and in order to establish and maintain
    confidence in the business validity and use case for coins or tokens such as the
    JPM Coin end users, customers, and clients are going to want to be able to examine
    the underlying controls and processes surrounding these tokens and coins. Especially
    if banking and other commercial clients are, in essence, outsourcing part of the
    payment processing this also leads to significant considerations that need to
    be factored into the control conversation.

  zh: 其次，随着区块链和不同类型的加密资产越来越多地融入更广泛的金融市场对话中，内部控制对话变得更加重要。除了传统的控制措施，用于存储、通信和向内部和外部利益相关者报告信息外，这种整合还指出了新兴的关注点和考虑因素。本质上，为了建立和维护诸如JPM币最终用户、客户和客户需要能够检查围绕这些代币和硬币的基础控制和流程的商业有效性和用例的信心。特别是如果银行和其他商业客户本质上外包了部分支付处理，这也引发了需要纳入控制对话的重大考虑。
- en: Third and also important to recognize is that, given the benefits and of scale
    and efficiency, that the odds of this being the only centralized payment processing
    platform is unlikely at best. While it is true that JP Morgan is larger and more
    international than some of the competitors in the space, other large financial
    institutions also have substantial heft to bring to the proverbial game. This
    is not as entirely abstract or radical in nature as it might initially appear,
    especially given the reality that many financial players already have internal
    platforms and payment systems in place in any case. Bringing and applying this
    next step, via blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies, to the financial
    conversation is a logical step and application of these technologies.

  zh: 第三个也要认识到的重要的是，鉴于规模和效率的好处，这个平台可能不太可能是唯一的集中化支付处理平台。尽管摩根大通比该领域的一些竞争对手更大更国际化，但其他大型金融机构也有相当的影响力可以用于这场比喻性的竞争。这并非如最初所想象的那样完全抽象或激进，尤其是考虑到许多金融参与者已经在任何情况下拥有内部平台和支付系统的现实。将这一步带入并应用到金融讨论中，无论是通过区块链还是其他分布式账本技术，都是这些技术的逻辑步骤和应用。
- en: The term distributed ledger was included here for a reason, and what this means
    is that not every distributed ledger is going to be classified or count as an
    authentic blockchain platform. Distributed ledgers are different from blockchains
    in a variety of ways that are different from blockchains in a number of technical
    ways, but that goes beyond the scope of this text. Linking back to the earlier
    conversation about internal controls this differentiation also leads to the control
    conversation and debate moving to the forefront. As different distributed ledgers
    are implemented and put into practice at different organizations and consortium
    models these different variations are going to need a variety of control and market
    based considerations. Accounting professionals, already versed in the control
    conversation and analysis around financial and operational information, should
    also be a part of the dialogue surrounding blockchain implementation and distributed
    ledgers. Taking a step back, however, reveals a much larger and much more substantial
    conversation and debate that should be had at a different number of organizations
    and institutions.

  zh: 这里包含了“分布式账本”一词是有原因的，这意味着并非每个分布式账本都会被归类或视为一个真正的区块链平台。分布式账本在多种技术方面与区块链不同，但这超出了本文的范围。回顾之前关于内部控制的讨论，这种区分也导致了对控制的讨论和辩论走向了前台。随着不同的分布式账本在不同的组织和联盟模式中的实施和应用，这些不同的变体将需要各种各样的控制和市场考虑。已经熟悉财务和运营信息围绕控制的讨论和分析的会计专业人士，也应该成为围绕区块链实施和分布式账本的对话的一部分。然而，回过头来，会揭示一个更大更重要的对话和辩论，该对话和辩论应该在不同数量的组织和机构中进行。
- en: Underpinning the global financial institution is the SWIFT payment network –
    in the United States – that facilitates the payment processing and transfer of
    funds between countless institutions on a daily basis. How this applies to the
    conversation in this book is that a blockchain based payment platform and processing
    structure built on a blockchain based platform represents a viable alternative
    to the current structure that is in place. By itself this might not seem like
    a radical or innovative idea, but it also means that Ripple, which up until the
    announcement by JP Morgan was the leader the distributed ledger payment processing
    system, is potentially under threat. Ripple has, from the very beginning, been
    an advocate and motivated participant in trying to work and coordinate with establishment
    plays and regulators to gain market share and network members, and this has worked
    to some extent. To collaborations with Western Union, and linking in establishment
    financial institutions such as Santandar, it did seem that Ripple was the leader
    in this aspect of the distributed ledger and blockchain space. The launch at JP
    Morgan, however, means that this space is rapidly evolving and changing even as
    investment levels continue to increase to the tens of billons of dollars. All
    of these headlines and trends, however, are merely symptoms of a broader shift
    leveraging emerging technologies to develop new product and service offerings

  zh: 支撑全球金融机构的是在美国的 SWIFT 支付网络，它每天促进着无数机构的资金处理和转移。 这在本书的讨论中的适用性在于，基于区块链的付款平台和处理结构建立在一个基于区块链的平台上，代表了对目前已有结构的可行替代方案。单独看这可能不像是一个激进或创新的想法，但它也意味着
    Ripple，直到 JP 摩根宣布之前一直是分布式账本支付处理系统的领导者，正面临潜在威胁。 从一开始，Ripple 一直是试图与建立联系和监管者合作来获取市场份额和网络成员的倡导者和积极参与者，而这在一定程度上是行得通的。与西联汇款的合作，并联系建立起
    Santandar 等金融机构，似乎 Ripple 在分布式账本和区块链领域中是领导者。 然而，在 JP 摩根的推出意味着这个领域正在迅速发展和变化，即使投资水平继续增加到数千亿美元。

    different custody and control requirements necessary to safeguard cryptocurrencies
    it is increasingly evidence that regulation and compliance are moving back to
    the forefront as business applications continue to mature and develop (Flinders
    [2018](#CR3)). In terms of action oriented business tasks and plans this means
    that the current relationships and dynamics between financial and legal experts,

    In order to do this, and in order to have those difficult conversations that position
    professionals to actually drive strategic change and planning, technology must
    be effectively leveraged. Drilling down, in order to have the time to partake
    in strategic planning, thinking, and execution, time cannot be spent doing tasks
    that could otherwise automated. Automating lower level tasks will, of course,
    require some trial and error and different iterations, but the drive toward automation
    is not a passing fad. Rather, it is a dramatic shift in how organizations interact
    with information and how financial professionals must engage with other management
    professionals. Third, and perhaps most importantly, is that financial professionals
    must be able to evaluate just how technology is going to change and shift the
    overall professional landscape. Instead of focusing on specific tasks or jobs
    that will be changed by the greater integration of technology, the mindset and
    approach should instead be on the different classes and types of work that will
    need to performed moving forward.

  zh: 参与规划过程，并实际推动组织变革必须成为每个金融专业人士的责任。为了做到这一点，为了进行那些能够使专业人士真正推动战略变革和规划的艰难对话，必须有效地利用技术。具体而言，为了有时间参与战略规划、思考和执行，就不能把时间花在可以自动化的任务上。自动化低层次的任务当然需要一些试错和不同的迭代，但走向自动化并不是一时的潮流。相反，这是组织如何与信息互动以及金融专业人士必须与其他管理专业人士交互的方式上的显著转变。第三，或许最重要的是，金融专业人士必须能够评估技术将如何改变和转变整体职业格局。与其关注技术更大程度整合将改变的具体任务或岗位，不如将心态和方法放在未来需要执行的不同类型工作和类别上。

    in a manner that is in alignment with both industry and regulatory expectations.
    These roles, be they the compilation of financial statements, compliance with

    importance of remaining in compliance in a fast moving and fast changing regulatory
    environment, ensuring that clients and customers remain in compliance with applicable
    laws and regulations will only become more important as both technology and regulation
    continue to change and evolve at what seems to be an accelerating rate. That said,
    simply assisting customers, clients, and partner organizations keep pace with
    regulatory changes and developments will not be sufficient going forward. Financial
    services professionals will need to evolve, become forward looking, and become
    more proactive; this is not anything new or particularly innovative to say. What
    may be a bit more unusual, however, are some of the tactics and strategies that
    both individuals and institutions can leverage to facilitate this transition.

    aware of what exactly is going in the background of trying to provide these services.
    Particularly among millennials and Gen-Z investors, which are comprising an ever
    increasing portion of the investment marketplace, there does seem to be lack of
    trust or faith in the both the ability of traditional financial advisors and the
    value that they can actually deliver in the form of returns. This is not an idle
    concern or something that can be put on the proverbial back burner; automated
    investing services such as Betterment and Wealthfront continue to accrue and capture
    greater share of these new investor classes. Advisors who do not take these changes

    a certain index, or passive funds that automatically rebalance in accordance with
    price changes of different asset classes, the underlying trend toward more automated
    investing does seem clear. Advisors, regardless of age and technical expertise,

- en: First, technology must be embraced in every aspect of how an investment advisor,
    brokerage, or other type of firm offering investing services operates. Whether
    it takes the form of building, or even just piggybacking off of existing mobile
    apps, hosting investor meetings via Zoom, Skype, or other mobile compatible platforms,
    or being flexible with when, where, and how clients wish to engage and solicit
    advice this is something that can usually be done with minimal or no cost. XRP,
    a blockchain based currency that poses an alternative to traditional fiat, and
    whose sponsor organization has coordinated closely with banking institutions,
    continues to position itself as an alternative to current banking relationships
    and structures (Crosman [2019](#CR1)). Second, the product offerings that are
    delivered by the organization to the marketplace must also keep pace and evolve
    with the expectations of investors. For example, index funds, lower fees, and
    more passive allocations are trends that – from every visible indicator – are
    continuing to accelerate as younger investors continue to enter the marketplace.
    At the very least, advisors need to be aware of both the trends themselves as
    well as the implications these trends have on investment returns as well the viability
    of current business models. Last, but not least, is that advisors must be able
    to effectively harness and leverage the advances in automation tools.

- en: A repeated concern and issue with many traditional financing arrangements is
    that consumers and customers are not evaluated on an individualized basis, but
    rather lumped into large categories based on broad arrays of identifiable information.
    Even the largest and most sophisticated financial institutions rely on several
    relatively basic and not technologically oriented methods to assess the creditworthiness
    of potential customers. This is the same technique and tactic used regardless
    of whether the potential client is an individual or an institution, which can
    cause many of the issues that have been repeated during various economic bubbles.
    Instead, and already occurring in the marketplace, several financial institutions
    and groups are leveraging different types of arrays of data and information to
    help make better lending and customer acquisition decisions. For example, and
    already being used by several institutions and organizations, a composite score
    and broad based array of data to more accurately asses the ability of a potential
    customer or client to successfully handle and repay the loan. Such data includes,
    building on the discussion from previous chapters, the importance or transparent
    and consistent pricing with regards to the impact that carbon driven events may
    have both on business projects and the shares of an organization overall (Liesen
    et al. [2017](#CR4)). This may seem like a relatively simple evolution and step
    toward a more technologically oriented and driven process, but represents a substantive
    shift from many traditional loan policies and procedures.

  zh: 传统融资安排的一个反复关注和问题是，消费者和客户并非根据个性化评估，而是根据广泛的可识别信息类别大规模划分。即使是最大和最复杂的金融机构也依赖于几种相对基本且非技术导向的方法来评估潜在客户的信用价值。这是相同的技术和策略，无论潜在客户是个人还是机构，都会导致在各种经济泡沫期间反复出现的许多问题。相反，在市场上已经出现，几家金融机构和团体正在利用不同类型的数据和信息数组来帮助做出更好的贷款和客户获取决策。例如，并且已经被几家机构和组织使用的是综合评分和广泛数据数组，以更准确地评估潜在客户或客户成功处理和偿还贷款的能力。这样的数据包括，根据前几章的讨论，透明和一致定价的重要性，这关系到碳驱动事件对商业项目和组织整体股份的影响（Liesen
    et al. [2017](#CR4)）。这可能看起来是一个相对简单的演变和迈出迈向更加技术定向和驱动的步骤，但代表了许多传统贷款政策和程序的实质性转变。
- en: For example, a start up enterprise or an entrepreneur who is in the midst of
    establishing and building a brand in the marketplace traditionally would have
    had issues obtaining sufficient or adequate financing to expand and further develop
    a business. Using traditional, and often incomplete, information and data such
    as credit scores, current levels of income, debt levels, and occupation, many
    aspiring – and ultimately successful – enterprises and individuals may be denied
    the financing so necessary for continued growth and development. Leveraging artificial
    intelligence platforms to gather and compile data from a more holistic array of
    sources such as social media impressions may actually create a more accurate representation
    and analysis of both current and potential future earnings. Applications of such
    comprehensive data gathering may include, but are not limited to social media
    impressions, media interviews and appearances, the number and scope of speaking
    and other public engagements, and relationships with other professional organizations.
    While not specifically linked to current financial status or earnings in the traditional
    context, these may indeed be more appropriate on a forward looking basis.

    in such a fast moving space including blockchain, RPA, or AI. That said, what
    this chapter attempts to do is to break down the headlines, sector specific trends,
    and product development in a way that provides readers with real world evidence
    of where these trends are headed. Emerging trends and forces tend to change labels
    and names as industries and organizations evolve over time, but that does not
    usually lead to a changing of how the changes impact professionals. Change is
    inevitable, but the pace of change appears to be amplified as technology stacks
    and combinations allows practitioners and organizations greater access to data
    and analytics associated with that information. Taking into account that this
    text was provided and written with professionals in mind, the examples and trends
    listed in this space are put together with the intent to generate actionable business
    intelligence. In other words, actionable business intelligence in the context
    of this book will be to help professionals putting together frameworks and business
    plans, to do so in a way that is logical and objective. After reading this chapter,
    users should be able to understand what trends and forces seem to be emerging
    and how they connect to blockchain forces.
