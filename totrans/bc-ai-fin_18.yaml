- en: With the launching of JPMCoin in the early days of 2019 there was a renewed
    discussion and debate around both the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    at large as well as the implications that such a launch means for existing options
    and companies already operating within the broader space. There was an abundant
    amount of discussion and analysis in the space following the announcement of the
    new token as well as the blockchain it operates on, but regardless of specifics
    that have been discussed, it does appear that there are a few core themes and
    topics that are driving this and other conversations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, and despite the countless headlines that heralded the launching of a
    new cryptocurrency by a large financial institution, in this case JP Morgan, the
    underlying reality is that this token – JPMcoin – is not a cryptocurrency by the
    definitions that have already been established. Rather, these more recent iterations
    and applications seem to instead build existing stablecoins, decentralized coins,
    and other banking affiliated cryptocurrencies and coins such as XRP (Roberts [2019](#CR6)).
    Instead of being a decentralized and distributed cryptocurrency or token operating
    outside or in parallel to the current financial system, this coin (or token),
    is controlled entirely by JP Morgan. In addition, and instead of operating on
    decentralized blockchain platform such as the bitcoin blockchain or etherum blockchain,
    the JPM Coin runs on a private permissioned blockchain. Seemingly against the
    up front promises and expectations associated with blockchain in general, this
    shift toward more of a private or permissioned blockchain platform is seemingly
    epitomized by the launch of this system. In addition to this change, this launch
    also leads to another question that should be considered as platforms like this
    continue to enter the marketplace.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, and something that strikes to the core of the idea of any blockchain
    or other financial system or platform is who is going to use blockchain systems.
    As discussed throughout this text, the public and virtually completely open sourced
    blockchain platforms do not appear to be well positioned for enterprise adoption.
    Centralized, private, or public permissioned blockchain models do seems to have
    more potential for greater enterprise and corporate adoption, but this can present
    the following contradiction. Forming such a private or centralized blockchain
    model means that, by default, the total member of network participants is going
    to be capped. This is no different for the blockchain model underpinning the JPM
    Coin. As of this writing, in early to the middle or 2019, the only proposed customers
    and clients of the JPM Coin and blockchain platform are the enterprise and commercial
    clients and customers already connected to JP Morgan in any case.

- en: This might seem like a basic or anecdotal point to analyze, but means that despite
    the hype, excitement, and discussion around this roll out and implementation that
    the market ceiling for this product and service remain relatively low. More to
    the point, and the true conversation and debate in the marketplace, is the competition
    and challenge that such a model poses to an organization like Ripple and the cryptocurrency
    XRP that functions and runs on the Ripple blockchain. As of the of the initial
    launch there were immediately critiques and comments from both sides of the topic
    as to whether or not this was a viable business idea or simply another sizzle
    first attempt to capture mind share or market position. That said, and acknowledging
    the fact that it is still early days in the conversation around JPM Coin and the
    underlying blockchain that it runs on, there are a few key considerations that
    should be part of an analysis moving forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, and something that cannot be overstated is that the blockchain model
    and JPM Coin that runs on this model is a centralized, private, and permission
    blockchain, and is not open to clients and customers outside of existing JP Morgan
    clients. Contrasting this to Ripple, which has made a concerted effort to attract
    large financial institutions and banks to join the network and begin using the
    bridge currency of XRP to assist in settling transactions, the difference is readily
    apparent. This closed and self contained system will, invariably, limit the potential
    users and applications for JPM Coin at the beginning, but that does mean that
    the system and model will be deprived of scale. With trillions of dollars passing
    through the payment processing and transaction settling business the implementation
    of this system – even if only utilized by JP Morgan clients and customers – will
    have profound ripple effects. That aside, let’s take a look at some of the key
    accounting and financial reporting considerations that are sure to arise as JPM
    Coin and, potentially, other similar models become more prevalent in the marketplace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first place to begin any related accounting analysis would seem to be around
    just how these different coins or tokens are going to be classified from an accounting
    perspective. Such a dialogue reveals, however, just how ambiguous and confusing
    the accounting rules and regulations continue to be for this space. In addition
    to the differences that are going to arise in any case, the accounting rules and
    guidelines for different types of cryptoassets continue to be represent a plethora
    of options. Drilling down, what this means for practitioners is that – for now
    at least – there are a number of options that organizations can embrace as long
    as they are also able to defend and justify these decisions.

- en: Second, the internal control conversation continues to become more important
    as blockchains and different types of cryptoassets become increasingly integrated
    into the broader financial market conversation. In addition to the traditional
    controls over the storage, communication, and reporting of information to both
    internal and external stakeholders, such integration also points to emerging areas
    of concern and consideration. In essence, and in order to establish and maintain
    confidence in the business validity and use case for coins or tokens such as the
    JPM Coin end users, customers, and clients are going to want to be able to examine
    the underlying controls and processes surrounding these tokens and coins. Especially
    if banking and other commercial clients are, in essence, outsourcing part of the
    payment processing this also leads to significant considerations that need to
    be factored into the control conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third and also important to recognize is that, given the benefits and of scale
    and efficiency, that the odds of this being the only centralized payment processing
    platform is unlikely at best. While it is true that JP Morgan is larger and more
    international than some of the competitors in the space, other large financial
    institutions also have substantial heft to bring to the proverbial game. This
    is not as entirely abstract or radical in nature as it might initially appear,
    especially given the reality that many financial players already have internal
    platforms and payment systems in place in any case. Bringing and applying this
    next step, via blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies, to the financial
    conversation is a logical step and application of these technologies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The term distributed ledger was included here for a reason, and what this means
    is that not every distributed ledger is going to be classified or count as an
    authentic blockchain platform. Distributed ledgers are different from blockchains
    in a variety of ways that are different from blockchains in a number of technical
    ways, but that goes beyond the scope of this text. Linking back to the earlier
    conversation about internal controls this differentiation also leads to the control
    conversation and debate moving to the forefront. As different distributed ledgers
    are implemented and put into practice at different organizations and consortium
    models these different variations are going to need a variety of control and market
    based considerations. Accounting professionals, already versed in the control
    conversation and analysis around financial and operational information, should
    also be a part of the dialogue surrounding blockchain implementation and distributed
    ledgers. Taking a step back, however, reveals a much larger and much more substantial
    conversation and debate that should be had at a different number of organizations
    and institutions.

    in the United States – that facilitates the payment processing and transfer of
    funds between countless institutions on a daily basis. How this applies to the
    conversation in this book is that a blockchain based payment platform and processing
    structure built on a blockchain based platform represents a viable alternative
    to the current structure that is in place. By itself this might not seem like
    a radical or innovative idea, but it also means that Ripple, which up until the
    announcement by JP Morgan was the leader the distributed ledger payment processing
    system, is potentially under threat. Ripple has, from the very beginning, been
    an advocate and motivated participant in trying to work and coordinate with establishment
    plays and regulators to gain market share and network members, and this has worked
    to some extent. To collaborations with Western Union, and linking in establishment
    financial institutions such as Santandar, it did seem that Ripple was the leader
    in this aspect of the distributed ledger and blockchain space. The launch at JP
    Morgan, however, means that this space is rapidly evolving and changing even as
    investment levels continue to increase to the tens of billons of dollars. All
    of these headlines and trends, however, are merely symptoms of a broader shift
    leveraging emerging technologies to develop new product and service offerings

- en: As this book has hopefully demonstrated, the pace of technological change and
    shifts within the landscape are uniquely positioned to have a dramatic impact
    on how organizations operate both internally as well as how they engage with externally
    stakeholders. Although technology has been a part of the accounting and financial
    services landscape for decades, the pace of change appears to be accelerating
    at an increasing pace. Professionals, put simply, are going to have to be able
    to keep up in order to succeed and thrive in the marketplace moving forward (Esposito
    [2017](#CR2)). While there will inevitably be some disruption and challenges that
    come alongside the rapid changes within the financial services landscape, it is
    equally as important to be aware of the opportunities and benefits that will occur
    as a result of this technological innovation and disruption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of whether this technology is perceived as a threat or an opportunity
    there are several fundamental realities that must be taken into account by financial
    services professionals, regardless of industry affiliation. First, blockchain
    and cryptocurrency technology are going to continue to proliferate and spread
    through the business landscape, and will have a dramatic change on fundamental
    aspects of how financial markets operates. Accounting, attestation, and offering
    assurance services over different types of information, including financial and
    nonfinancial data, will be transformed due to the core components of how blockchain
    functions. Prior to returning to the technical and specific analyses of how financial
    services will be changed and disrupted by emerging technologies, it is important
    to circle back to the underlying themes and forces that will drive change within
    the profession.

    stated at different conferences, events, and other organizational gatherings,
    and even throughout this text, is that accounting and finance professionals are
    going to have to become more familiar with collaborating with other professionals.
    What this means is that, in addition to the discussions and analyses presented
    throughout this text, is that the changing dynamics of the marketplace are going
    to drive such change in a number of tangible and business ready ways. Put another
    way, in addition to the conceptual understanding and examination of these changes,
    practitioners need to also understand how these changes will emerge and develop
    in terms of different roles and responsibilities in the marketplace going forward.

    and artificial intelligence tools throughout the business landscape logically
    mean that financial professionals will need to coordinate more closely with legal
    experts. From ethical complications that will inevitably arise from the developing
    and refinement of different artificial intelligence tools and robotic process
    automation procedures, to how blockchain will change legal obligations, to the
    different custody and control requirements necessary to safeguard cryptocurrencies
    it is increasingly evidence that regulation and compliance are moving back to
    the forefront as business applications continue to mature and develop (Flinders
    [2018](#CR3)). In terms of action oriented business tasks and plans this means
    that the current relationships and dynamics between financial and legal experts,
    already existing via partnerships in conjunction with JD’s, LLM’s, and financial
    professionals will need to be increasingly sophisticated, entrenched, and embedded
    into business models.

    the importance of maintaining and implementing comprehensive insurance and cyber
    insurance policies. Not always the most scintillating part of the conversation,
    nor the most exciting aspect of the financial services profession or professional
    landscape, this is something that is going to be increasingly important moving
    forward. It is important to recognize that the legal intersection of insurance,
    law, and finance is not anything new, but that the cybersecurity conversation
    and policies are more extensive than most practitioners and organizations might
    realize. For example, the paper perspective of accounting and finance – despite
    the growing technological integration and forces in the profession – is still
    a dominant factor that must be accounted for, controlled, and factored into the
    debate around cyber policies.

- en: Third, and finally, these relationships and conversations connected to the emerging
    areas at the intersection of accounting and legal practitioners is that this relationship
    is going to have become more continuous and ongoing in nature versus one off arraignments
    of periodic conversations. Having continuous dialogues and conversations between
    these professionals and practitioners is going to be essential in order for either
    profession to succeed and thrive in the marketplace moving forward. As these emerging
    technologies drive change, disrupt current positions, and make doing business
    as usual unsustainable these changes and fact patterns are going to only become
    more important. In addition to these relationships, the third leg of this proverbial
    stool is different professionals are going to have to become more comfortable
    and familiar with working with a different subset of professionals.

    and the senior leadership of the organization, but almost exclusively relies on
    the same types of quantitative information that lie directly in the core competencies
    embedded in the financial services function. As strategy and strategic planning
    become, almost without exception, increasingly dependent on the very information
    that financial services professionals deal with on a continuous basis, this presents
    an opportunity for financial services professionals to obtain a more strategic
    and leadership-centric role (Page [2014](#CR5)). That said, in order for these
    expectations and possibilities to transform from a simple expectation to actual
    reality, there is a definitive shift that must take place among the professionals
    currently employed within these fields. In short, and acknowledging the reality
    that technology can drive change throughout the professional landscape, simply
    being aware of technology is not enough to enable financial service professionals
    to become more strategically oriented.

- en: Adopting a strategic headset, embracing the strategic planning process, and
    actually becoming the business partners and strategic advisors that financial
    service professionals want to be, requires at least two definitive steps that
    every professionals can and should embrace. First, financial professionals have
    to be open to job automation, digitization, and displacement of some current market
    opportunities. This is obviously easier said than done, but is something that
    must be taken into account due to the following simple reality; technology will
    continue to become more integrated and professionals must be able to understand,
    implement, and use these tools. Second, financial service professionals must be
    willing to partake in planning and strategic conversations, which may require
    having difficult conversations that may have been avoided in the past. While financial
    service professionals may have been involved to some extent previously, it is
    usually just at the end of the process to verify, check, or analyze the information
    that has already been generated.

    the organization must a part of every financial professionals responsibility.
    In order to do this, and in order to have those difficult conversations that position
    professionals to actually drive strategic change and planning, technology must
    be effectively leveraged. Drilling down, in order to have the time to partake
    in strategic planning, thinking, and execution, time cannot be spent doing tasks
    that could otherwise automated. Automating lower level tasks will, of course,
    require some trial and error and different iterations, but the drive toward automation
    is not a passing fad. Rather, it is a dramatic shift in how organizations interact
    with information and how financial professionals must engage with other management
    professionals. Third, and perhaps most importantly, is that financial professionals
    must be able to evaluate just how technology is going to change and shift the
    overall professional landscape. Instead of focusing on specific tasks or jobs
    that will be changed by the greater integration of technology, the mindset and
    approach should instead be on the different classes and types of work that will
    need to performed moving forward.

    reporting, and getting certain pieces of information delivered to the marketplace
    in a manner that is in alignment with both industry and regulatory expectations.
    These roles, be they the compilation of financial statements, compliance with
    investor security laws, or operating in adherence with fiduciary rules and responsibilities,
    will not change. In fact, and as mentioned in this last section focusing on the
    importance of remaining in compliance in a fast moving and fast changing regulatory
    environment, ensuring that clients and customers remain in compliance with applicable
    laws and regulations will only become more important as both technology and regulation
    continue to change and evolve at what seems to be an accelerating rate. That said,
    simply assisting customers, clients, and partner organizations keep pace with
    regulatory changes and developments will not be sufficient going forward. Financial
    services professionals will need to evolve, become forward looking, and become
    more proactive; this is not anything new or particularly innovative to say. What
    may be a bit more unusual, however, are some of the tactics and strategies that
    both individuals and institutions can leverage to facilitate this transition.

    the importance of individuals employed in the financial services sector to act
    in the best interest of clients, but that does not mean that clients are also
    aware of what exactly is going in the background of trying to provide these services.
    Particularly among millennials and Gen-Z investors, which are comprising an ever
    increasing portion of the investment marketplace, there does seem to be lack of
    trust or faith in the both the ability of traditional financial advisors and the
    value that they can actually deliver in the form of returns. This is not an idle
    concern or something that can be put on the proverbial back burner; automated
    investing services such as Betterment and Wealthfront continue to accrue and capture
    greater share of these new investor classes. Advisors who do not take these changes
    and evolutions into account will, invariably, find themselves on the wrong side
    of these demographic trends moving forward.

    the rise of automated investing options that are managed or overseen by humans
    at some point in the process. Whether it takes the form of index funds that track
    a certain index, or passive funds that automatically rebalance in accordance with
    price changes of different asset classes, the underlying trend toward more automated
    investing does seem clear. Advisors, regardless of age and technical expertise,
    however, can take several steps to help augment current offerings with the technology
    that is arriving on the professional landscape in any case. A few of these action
    items and steps include, but are not limited to the following
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, technology must be embraced in every aspect of how an investment advisor,
    brokerage, or other type of firm offering investing services operates. Whether
    it takes the form of building, or even just piggybacking off of existing mobile
    apps, hosting investor meetings via Zoom, Skype, or other mobile compatible platforms,
    or being flexible with when, where, and how clients wish to engage and solicit
    advice this is something that can usually be done with minimal or no cost. XRP,
    a blockchain based currency that poses an alternative to traditional fiat, and
    whose sponsor organization has coordinated closely with banking institutions,
    continues to position itself as an alternative to current banking relationships
    and structures (Crosman [2019](#CR1)). Second, the product offerings that are
    delivered by the organization to the marketplace must also keep pace and evolve
    with the expectations of investors. For example, index funds, lower fees, and
    more passive allocations are trends that – from every visible indicator – are
    continuing to accelerate as younger investors continue to enter the marketplace.
    At the very least, advisors need to be aware of both the trends themselves as
    well as the implications these trends have on investment returns as well the viability
    of current business models. Last, but not least, is that advisors must be able
    to effectively harness and leverage the advances in automation tools.

    that consumers and customers are not evaluated on an individualized basis, but
    rather lumped into large categories based on broad arrays of identifiable information.
    Even the largest and most sophisticated financial institutions rely on several
    relatively basic and not technologically oriented methods to assess the creditworthiness
    of potential customers. This is the same technique and tactic used regardless
    of whether the potential client is an individual or an institution, which can
    cause many of the issues that have been repeated during various economic bubbles.
    Instead, and already occurring in the marketplace, several financial institutions
    and groups are leveraging different types of arrays of data and information to
    help make better lending and customer acquisition decisions. For example, and
    already being used by several institutions and organizations, a composite score
    and broad based array of data to more accurately asses the ability of a potential
    customer or client to successfully handle and repay the loan. Such data includes,
    building on the discussion from previous chapters, the importance or transparent
    and consistent pricing with regards to the impact that carbon driven events may
    have both on business projects and the shares of an organization overall (Liesen
    et al. [2017](#CR4)). This may seem like a relatively simple evolution and step
    toward a more technologically oriented and driven process, but represents a substantive
    shift from many traditional loan policies and procedures.

    establishing and building a brand in the marketplace traditionally would have
    had issues obtaining sufficient or adequate financing to expand and further develop
    a business. Using traditional, and often incomplete, information and data such
    as credit scores, current levels of income, debt levels, and occupation, many
    aspiring – and ultimately successful – enterprises and individuals may be denied
    the financing so necessary for continued growth and development. Leveraging artificial
    intelligence platforms to gather and compile data from a more holistic array of
    sources such as social media impressions may actually create a more accurate representation
    and analysis of both current and potential future earnings. Applications of such
    comprehensive data gathering may include, but are not limited to social media
    impressions, media interviews and appearances, the number and scope of speaking
    and other public engagements, and relationships with other professional organizations.
