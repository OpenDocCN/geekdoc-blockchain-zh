    controlling inventory, managing manufacturing plant capacity, ensuring Return-On-Investment,
    and accelerating digital transformation to cater the challenges of changing market
    dynamics and evolving customer expectations. Also, the limited operational visibility
    due to complex and expansive supply chains spread across geographies – which make
    it difficult to track and trace the movement of raw material, finished products
    and spare parts, as they make their way through production facilities, warehouses,
    distributors and sales outlets. Blockchain is the one way secured and traceable
    solution to pertinent challenges being faced by the manufacturing industries.

    Mechanism (MRM) of electronic signatures based on the DVCS oracle in the blockchain
    platform for the global supply chain. The authors begin their research by comparing
    a single-domain traditional supply chain with a multi-domain global supply chain.
    In the second case, the necessity of using an MRM electronic signature based on
    the DVCS oracle is justified. Various options for constructing MRM are discussed.
    The chapter provides a comparative assessment of the electronic signature validation
    protocols and the rationale for using the DVCS protocol to implement the blockchain
    oracle. As a result, the authors propose to use a well-tested software and hardware
    complex of the Litoria DVCS as a DVCS oracle and illustrate its use with practical
    examples.

    and from transforming the raw into finished products but it has challenges that
    are needed to be achieved like good quality services to the consumer, reducing
    labor cost, etc. Industries need to digitize real assets and make distributed,
    immutable transactions, possible to trace assets from manufacture to supply. To
    overcome the lack of transparency and traceability of the products in the Enterprise
    Resource Planning system in Supply Chain (SC) and logistics issues, there is a
    solid need to employ a method that can efficiently track assets from production
    to supply decentralized, immutable records of all transactions. A blockchain (BC)
    is a decentralized software network that follows a digital ledger to exchange
    entities digitally and a way through which it makes secure transactions. Thus,
    this chapter proposes integrating BC in Logistics and SC Monitoring by giving
    a template on how Python and Flask can be used for BC with the SCM system to improve
    traceability without involving any intermediary.

    depend on an assortment of outside counterparties, blockchain has arisen as a
    feasible possibility to de-tangle all information, archives, correspondence exchanges
    that exist inside the production network organization. Each production network
    will have enormous measure of information being traded between different stages
    in a supply chain network. To deal with colossal of measure of information and
    guarantee its security, supply chain can consolidate IoT and blockchain. This
    will help in further developing security, usefulness, proficiency, and benefit
    of the production network. This chapter examines the foundation of blockchain,
    IoT and a portion of the issues confronting present day supply chain. The significant
    advantages for supply chains utilizing IoT and blockchain would be analyzed and
