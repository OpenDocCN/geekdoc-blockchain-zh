- en: Blockchain technology is a digitalized public ledger, which was initially used
    only for cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain is one of the cutting-edge technologies
    that have the potential to utterly transform the manufacturing industry. Blockchain
    technologies have the potential to radically change manufacturing supply chains
    and irradicate the middleman, streamline processes, and improve security on the
    whole—as well as simplify data management.

  zh: 区块链技术是一种数字化的公共账本，最初仅用于加密货币交易。区块链是一种有潜力彻底改变制造业的前沿技术之一。区块链技术有潜力彻底改变制造供应链，消除中间商，简化流程，并在整体上提高安全性，同时简化数据管理。
- en: Manufacturers across the globe are facing challenges with forecasting demand,
    controlling inventory, managing manufacturing plant capacity, ensuring Return-On-Investment,
    and accelerating digital transformation to cater the challenges of changing market
    dynamics and evolving customer expectations. Also, the limited operational visibility
    due to complex and expansive supply chains spread across geographies – which make
    it difficult to track and trace the movement of raw material, finished products
    and spare parts, as they make their way through production facilities, warehouses,
    distributors and sales outlets. Blockchain is the one way secured and traceable
    solution to pertinent challenges being faced by the manufacturing industries.

  zh: 制造商们在全球范围内面临着诸多挑战，包括预测需求、控制库存、管理制造厂的产能、确保投资回报率，以及加速数字化转型，以满足不断变化的市场动态和不断演变的客户期望。此外，由于供应链跨越地理位置，操作可见度有限，这使得追踪原材料、成品和备件在生产设施、仓库、分销商和销售网点间的流动变得困难。区块链是制造业面临的挑战的一种安全、可追溯的解决方案。
- en: Now a days, manufacturers are developing blockchain implementations that have
    the potential to cater them in streamline operations, gain greater visibility
    into supply chains and track assets with unprecedented precision. Blockchain has
    potential to revolutionize how manufacturers design, engineer, make and scale
    their products. Blockchain is gradually proving to be an effective “middleware”
    solution for enabling seamless interoperability within complex supply chains.
    Due to its technological nature, blockchain enables secure, transparent and fast
    data exchanges as well as allowing for the creation of immutable records databases

  zh: 如今，制造商们正在开发具有潜力的区块链实现，以简化操作、更好地了解供应链，并以前所未有的精度跟踪资产。区块链有潜力彻底改变制造商如何设计、制造和扩展其产品。由于其技术特性，区块链逐渐证明是复杂供应链内无缝互操作的有效“中间件”解决方案。由于其技术性质，区块链能够实现安全、透明和快速的数据交换，同时允许创建不可变的记录数据库。
- en: The main advantage of Blockchain in Manufacturing Industries is product traceability,
    supply chain transparency, compliance monitoring, and auditability. Moreover,
    leveraging blockchain technology into a manufacturing enterprise can enhance its
    security and reduce the rates of systematic failures. So, blockchain is now used
    in various sectors of the manufacturing industry, such as automotive, aerospace,
    defense, pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, textile, food and beverages, etc.
    Hence, Blockchain should be seen as an investment in future-readiness and customer-centricity,
    not as an experimental technology – because the evidence is overwhelming.

    agendas, owing to their potential advantages across a wide range of sectors. This
    is due to their practical skills in resolving many problems that are presently
    impeding progress in different industrial sectors. These problems include securely
    capturing and exchanging transactional data, creating automated and efficient
    supply chain procedures, and improving transparency throughout the whole value
    chain. Blockchain provides an effective method to address these problems using
    distributed, shared, secure, and permission transactional ledgers. The uses of
    blockchain technology in the manufacturing and logistics sectors have been examined
    in this chapter. The study shows many possibilities for using blockchain in different
    industrial sectors; nevertheless, certain obstacles must be solved before this
    technology can be fully used. This chapter also covers case studies and difficulties
    encountered in the industrial and logistics sectors while using blockchain.

    Mechanism (MRM) of electronic signatures based on the DVCS oracle in the blockchain
    platform for the global supply chain. The authors begin their research by comparing
    a single-domain traditional supply chain with a multi-domain global supply chain.
    In the second case, the necessity of using an MRM electronic signature based on
    the DVCS oracle is justified. Various options for constructing MRM are discussed.
    The chapter provides a comparative assessment of the electronic signature validation
    protocols and the rationale for using the DVCS protocol to implement the blockchain
    oracle. As a result, the authors propose to use a well-tested software and hardware
    complex of the Litoria DVCS as a DVCS oracle and illustrate its use with practical

- en: Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a system to manage the flow of goods and services,
    and from transforming the raw into finished products but it has challenges that
    are needed to be achieved like good quality services to the consumer, reducing
    labor cost, etc. Industries need to digitize real assets and make distributed,
    immutable transactions, possible to trace assets from manufacture to supply. To
    overcome the lack of transparency and traceability of the products in the Enterprise
    Resource Planning system in Supply Chain (SC) and logistics issues, there is a
    solid need to employ a method that can efficiently track assets from production
    to supply decentralized, immutable records of all transactions. A blockchain (BC)
    is a decentralized software network that follows a digital ledger to exchange
    entities digitally and a way through which it makes secure transactions. Thus,
    this chapter proposes integrating BC in Logistics and SC Monitoring by giving
    a template on how Python and Flask can be used for BC with the SCM system to improve
    traceability without involving any intermediary.

  zh: 供应链管理（SCM）是管理货物和服务流动的系统，从将原材料转化为成品，但它面临着需要解决的挑战，如向消费者提供优质服务，降低劳动成本等。 工业需要将真实资产数字化，并实现分布式、不可变交易，以便从制造到供应追溯资产。
    为了克服供应链（SC）中企业资源规划系统和物流问题中产品透明度和可追溯性的缺乏，有必要采用一种能够高效跟踪资产从生产到供应的方法，即所有交易的分散、不可变记录。
    区块链（BC）是一个遵循数字分类帐以数字方式交换实体的分散式软件网络，以及通过该方式进行安全交易的一种方式。 因此，本章提议通过提供如何使用 Python
    和 Flask 与 SCM 系统集成 BC 的模板，将 BC 集成到物流和 SC 监控中，以改善可追溯性而不涉及任何中介。

    4.0, the complexity of the multiple connected organizations makes it impossible
    for a clear view of logistics operation. Since customers’ information is shared
    between companies, unauthorized access to personal information is inevitable and
    it poses several threats to customers. To address this challenge, Blockchain with
    some fascinating properties like enhanced security and transparency will be deployed.
    Blockchain is a technology that can be used to improve efficiency, visibility,
    and security in logistics management. This paper will explore the current applications
    of Blockchain in logistics management, based on an analysis of the findings of
    several scholars. The change from traditional logistics to digital logistics,
    digital logistics issues, as well as Blockchain principles, this study also provides
    useful insights into how Blockchain can disrupt conventional operations in logistics
    management. It also lays the groundwork for future study into Blockchain's applicability
