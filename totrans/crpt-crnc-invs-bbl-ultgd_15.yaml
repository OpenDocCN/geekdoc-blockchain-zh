    profit even more. Your greed may result in you not only in missing out on profits
    but bearing a loss as well.

    or down movements, do not fall into panic and sell it immediately. I know a lot
    of examples when the almost stable price of a cryptocurrency suddenly increased
    ten-fold in a week. You may ask how not to meet a loss when the market tumbles.
    My answer is: do not change all your cryptocurrency for fiat! Many people make
    this mistake and deplore it later. Before selling everything, you’d better monitor
    thematic forums and user reviews on this coin.'

    you can purchase some assets at a seemingly attractive price but fail to sell
    everything you have purchased.

    to know whether there will be spikes. Thus, having analyzed the cryptocurrency
    price changes and having found certain regularities, you can create your own strategy
    and trading plan. You can start to refine it in real conditions, starting with
    small amounts allowed on almost all exchanges. If your strategy proves to be successful,
    you may gradually increase your investments.
