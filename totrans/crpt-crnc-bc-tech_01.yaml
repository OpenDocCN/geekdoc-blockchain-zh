    In the meanwhile, the transactions based on the cryptocurrency has also increased
    significantly over the last decade. At the same time, the concept of blockchain
    has become popularized since the rise of cryptocurrencies as the background technology
    of the cryptocurrency. In this chapter, we will outline the technical and economic
    aspects of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The first set of questions we attempt
    to answer include, but not limited to: What is blockchain? What is the Bitcoin
    mining process? What is crypto-transactions?'

    widened role of these new technologies in real economic transactions, as well
    as financial markets. Transactions of goods, commodity, and asset markets used
    to have nothing to do with blockchain-based operations, while nowadays, several
    essential products are traded with the help of the blockchain. For instance, a
    consulting firm EY advisory has oriented an empirical experiment of blockchain
    in a commodity market, e. g., wine transactions. What would be the impact of the
    blockchain adoption on the wine market? Why do we need blockchain in wine transactions?
    How does it change the wine market properties, such as the quality of wine, transaction
    prices?

    how and why Bitcoin differs from existing money and digital currencies. One of
    the characterizing issues in this regard is the double-spending problem. Suppose
    that Bob purchases a book online by using a mobile payment system. After the delivery
    of the book, he can hack into the online ledger and rewrite his account information
    to pretend that the transaction has not made and to retrieve his money. Physical
    money has addressed this issue by developing sophisticated printing technology,
    thereby making it difficult to forge bills. Furthermore, cash with a physical
    entity (coin and paper bill) cannot be used twice because it cannot be in Bob’s
    pocket if Alice holds it in her hand.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it becomes increasingly hard to counterfeit physical bills, most of
    our daily transactions have become digital, e. g., debit card transactions, payment
    by PayPal, Venmo, Google Pay, just to name a few. The conventional digital currencies
    are subject to the double spending problem because it is vulnerable to information
    manipulations. If a ledger system has a flaw, Bob may manipulate ledger information
    and retrieve the money he paid. The problem is traditionally handled by setting
    some centralized agency with anti-manipulation security. Although it can be secure,
    it comes with a considerable cost, and users are concerned about the credibility
    issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What blockchain and the Bitcoin provide is a new solution to this issue. Decentralized
    management with a hard-to-rollback mechanism mitigates the problem. It distributes
    transaction information to a large number of nodes of participating computers.
    The data is timestamped and irreversible. A set of transaction records are impounded
    into a block, encrypted, and attached to the pre-existing chain of information.
    The process repeats over and over again to generate a sequence of chained blocks,
    i. e., the blockchain. As all the nodes have information about a state of the
    world, there must be a consensus mechanism that determines what is the correct
    state and what should be recorded in a block.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first building block is the decentralized management of information. Information
    is distributed to a large (potentially infinite) number of computers, and each
    of them keeps track of information. Firstly, this prevents a single point of failure,
    meaning that even when one node of the network fails, the system as a whole can
    keep track of the correct information.

    a centralized player exerts her monopolistic power, she may have an incentive
    to manipulate and distort information in favour of her. As we discuss in the following
    subsection, information on the blockchain must be the consensus of the network.
    Thus, even if a single record keeper tries to manipulate information, it is almost
    impossible to achieve.[¹](#fn_8)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a nutshell, a centralized record keeper in the traditional record-keeping
    system is replaced by a large number of competitive record keepers (called “miners”
    in Bitcoin network) in the blockchain system. They competitively determine what
    information they impound into the blockchain system by a certain consensus mechanism,
    rather than a single centralized entity makes a decision on it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second building block is how to reach the consensus. The mechanism must
    make the consensus hard to manupurate, and a critical technological advance, the
    cryptography, kicks in here.[²](#fn_9) A key element in reaching consensus is
    the selection of nodes that chooses the legitimate information. As there is no
    centralized player in the blockchain network, some terminal node has to make a
    decision. The process of selecting the node is unique to each application but,
    in the Bitcoin and other large blockchains (e. g., Ethereum), the consensus mechanism
    called Proof-of-Work (PoW) is employed. We focus on PoW in the following, although
    there are many other possibilities of consensus algorithm, such as Proof-of-Stake
    ([Saleh](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_014), [2019](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_014)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PoW is a process that (i) asks each node in the network to solve computation-heavy
    cryptographic problems and (ii) rewards the first node that successfully solves
    the problem by giving the right to authorize the information and record it on
    the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cryptographic problem relies on a hash function. The hash function should
    satisfy several properties (e. g., uniformity, universality, deterministic function,
    defined range) that are desirable for the mining protocol explained below to work.
    Specifically, nodes are asked to find a solution to a mathematical problem of
    finding a correct value. The expected time until finding the solution is determined
    by the difficulty target. At the same time, it decreases as computing power, called
    hash power, that each node devotes to the problem becomes strong. Solving a problem
    requires high computation power, and this triggers a competition among nodes,
    i. e., if other nodes adopt higher hash power, you are less likely to win the
    race. This process of finding the value is called mining, as it is reminiscent
    of finding metal ore from a mine. When a node wins the race, the mining reward
    is paid in the Bitcoin, and she is entitled to record information on the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This helps explain why information on the blockchain is (almost) tamper-free.
    First, a malicious entity trying to rewrite information on a chain must accumulate
    enormous computing power that outrace the other participants in the network. Second,
    a potential attacker must find significant benefits of attack, i. e., returns
    from mining the Bitcoin must outweigh the cost of computing power.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through the competition between decentralized record keepers, the total hash
    rate affects the quality of consensus. As we will discuss later, having a high
    hash rate may improve the quality of the consensus, as winning the race becomes
    more costly for each miner, and her incentive to manipulate information by devoting
    a large power diminishes. This incentive problem will be translated to the degree
    of information frictions in economic transactions, as we will discuss in the later
    section.

    the hash rate continued to decrease in line with the timing of the crash of the
    virtual currency market. During these times, companies may be forced to withdraw
    from the mining business. This observation will be a crucial ingredient to our
    economic analysis in Section [3](#b_9783110660807-002_s_012).

    of blockchain. [Szabo](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_015) ([1997](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_015))
    characterizes it as a contract that is executed automatically based on specified
    conditions without any centralized authorizations. Although the cryptographic
    security mechanism was simply one of the possible choices to implement the smart
    contract, the blockchain grows to be the primary mechanism that guarantees secure
    transactions in implementing smart contracts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain, as the underlying technology, suits the objective of smart contracts
    quite well. Firstly, the decentralized information-keeping system with the consensus
    mechanism makes the deals verifiable and thus enforceable without relying on a
    centralized authority (i. e., the first condition of the smart contract). Moreover,
    Ethereum has invented a blockchain system that records information contingent
    on some pre-specified conditions (i. e., the second condition of the smart contract).
    That is, a transaction is verified—i. e., information on payment and delivery
    is recorded as “correct” and becomes immutable—if and only if a specified condition
    is satisfied.

    it also works as a new form of “warranty” on goods’ quality. It is novel because
    information on which the contract is contingent is managed by the decentralized
    record keepers rather than a centralized authority. In Section [3](#b_9783110660807-002_s_012),

    problem. The problem of scalability, in general, emerges when the number of participants
    of the blockchain increase. Here, the participants include miners of the cryptocurrency
    and users. On the one hand, when the size of a miner pool increases, record-keeping
    becomes slow. In particular, the speed of transmitting the latest state of the
    blockchain hinges on the slowest node in the network. Since anybody can participate
    in the blockchain network, a low-performance node typically slows down the whole
    system.

- en: On the other hand, if many users flood to the cryptocurrency, loadings in the
    blockchain network explode, which in many cases results in significant waiting
    time for transfers and increasing transaction fees. One manifestation of such
    a problem includes the congestion effect; a long queue for transaction approval
    may incentivize users to pay high transaction fees because miners work on transactions
    that yield a high commission. The congestion effect rises the overall cost of
    using the blockchain ([Easley et al.](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_010), [2019](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_010);

    blockchain. The blockchain can generate consensus on information that is accumulated
    in the blockchain system and make it immutable. However, original information
    must be introduced to the blockchain from an external source. This outside information
    must also be trusted to make the whole blockchain system secure. How to guarantee
    the trustworthiness is called the oracle problem.

- en: For instance, in the wine blockchain, we want to establish that a grape variety
    stored in the blockchain has not been manipulated but nothing within the blockchain
    implies that the original information injected into the system is not a lie. This
    casts a doubt on the smart contract too. Suppose that you made a transaction of
    wine contingent on some conditions, such as “make payment if and only if the wine
    is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa, CA.” You are (almost) sure that no information
    manipulations are made after the information is impounded into the blockchain
    record-keeping system, i. e., once the blockchain guarantees that the bottle is
    100% CabSau, it is hard to mix it with Pinot Noir and still claim it as 100% CabSau.
    However, you are not sure if the first-place information is correct. The blockchain
    node cannot distinguish the grape in the first place. We will come back to this
    issue when we analyze the implications for real economic transactions.

    case, the blockchain splits at a point in the chain. The split is called fork.
    Forks are potentially detrimental to the whole blockchain system because it may
    undermine the consensus of the information stored in the chain. Several existing
    studies tackle the problem why the fork occurs. For example, [Biais et al.](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_006)

    freed part of the settlement risks that were inherent in security markets. In
    this context, settlement risks entail the failure of delivery of the security
    by the seller while receiving the payment, or vice versa. A smart contract may
    achieve the delivery versus payment (DvP) mechanism through the automated blockchain
    infrastructure without any central authority. In particular, [Chiu and Koeppl](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_008)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_008)) argues that the main advantage of blockchain
    in this case is “it can speed settlement, both by getting rid of a fragmented
    post-trade infrastructure and by implementing a more flexible settlement cycle.”

    order with time stamps. Therefore, new financial contracts emerged that depend
    on the event that happened, but also the timing of the event. By so doing [Tinn](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_016)

    and information distribution that are inseparable from each other. Namely, to
    achieve the decentralized consensus, the blockchain needs to have the information
    verified by the participating nodes. For this purpose, it needs to distribute
    (sometimes sensitive) data. [Cong and He](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_009) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_009))

    They find that although the blockchain may achieve higher competition by mitigating
    the problem of incomplete contracts, it potentially induces collusion among sellers.

    a somewhat abstract motivation and bring ourselves down to a more particular and
    precise question. This process starts by asking: what is the general equilibrium
    (GE) implications to economic transactions of blockchain adoption? In our context,
    GE means that we are interested in the joint determination of economic variables,
    including prices of goods, trading volume, market quality, as well as blockchain-related
    variables, such as the value of cryptocurrencies and miner pool sizes. Discussions

    do the economic outcomes of our interest look like, such as the price and volume
    of the cryptocurrency traded, the sorting of users that use cryptocurrency, the
    quality of the goods traded? What will happen when the cost of cryptocurrency
    mining increases? Would the decentralized transaction space be better than the

    a collection of technologies and concepts that enable the decentralized information
    keeping system. This defining feature is inseparably connected to the recent flood

    due to the changes in the international regulations and decreases in the shipping

    solution to this problem is introducing a centralized record keeper. However,
    typically, the solution is costly, as we discussed above. The blockchain has the

    If the requirement stating that only the high-quality goods may be transacted
    is not satisfied, either of the parties may terminate the transaction without
    actual changes in the ownership of goods and money. By doing this, we may potentially
    achieve that the goods transacted under smart contracts backed by the blockchain
    may be reliable to be high-quality.

    reliable the information stored in the blockchain. As we discussed in the sections
    above, given the oracle problem, there is no way to guarantee the information
    conveyed in any protocols is true for sure. What blockchains can do is to mitigate
    the uncertainty in the information. We call the level of uncertainty as “security”
    of the blockchain. When the security is high, the uncertainty of the information
    stored is low, and vice versa.

    when the underlying technology, such as the program codes written to operate the
    blockchain, is robust and sophisticated. However, it is not the end of the story.
    It is critical to recognize and emphasize the role of miners and the size of miner
    pools. The size matters because of the decentralized property of the blockchain—the
    more miners participate, the less the benefit of cheating is. We will detail the
    specific mechanisms below. At this point, we only claim two. First, there is a
    concept of the security level of the blockchain. Second, it has to be determined
    at the end of the analysis.

    miners enter the mining pool? As we discussed in the technical section, the miners
    join the pool and engage in the mining process (most likely equipped with ASIC
    in case of PoW protocol) if and only if it is profitable to do so. When is the
    entry profitable? For simplification, we focus on the role of the price of the
    cryptocurrency attached to the blockchain. In other words, miners enter when the
    price of cryptocurrency is high. We acknowledge, in reality, there are many aspects
    to be concerned when determining profitability. Furthermore, [Aoyagi and Adachi](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005)

    chain achieved and maintained? To answer this question, we look into the partially
    verifiable false-reporting and reputation costs. In particular, let us consider
    the simplified reporting system the miners or record keepers may tell the truth
    or lie. Whenever profitable for the keeper, (s)he can tell a lie, risking verification
    by a third party. In this case, (s)he would suffer from the reputation loss due
    to the misreporting. This consideration disciplines the keeper. In this situation,
    the security level is determined according to the size of the mining pool. Namely,
    as the mining pool gets massive, chances of winning to add the block are lower.
    Hence it does not worth risking the reputation cost for many miners. Thus, a large
    mining pool increases the overall security level of the information stored in
    the blockchain. Note that this resembles the positive network effect studied in
    [Pagnotta and Buraschi](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_013) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_013)).'

    the study of blockchains and cryptocurrency, it is relatively understudied how
    the user side of the blockchain interact with miners. In fact, users are also
    expected to actively respond to the features of the blockchain, the security level,
    and the price of cryptocurrencies—obviously, the secure the blockchain is, the
    value for the user increases. The cheaper the cryptocurrency price is, the more
    valuable it is for buyers of the goods transacted, the less for sellers. Given
    the discussions above, we consider these points in detail under the dual markets
    where the products may be sold and purchased in the traditional market where the
    means of payment is cash or traditional digital currencies, and the blockchain-based
    market where the transaction is done in the cryptocurrency based on the blockchain.
    In particular, to participate in the blockchain-based market and make a purchase,
    the buyer must hold the cryptocurrency token beforehand. Therefore, there is a
    link between the users and miners of the blockchain in the following sense. On
    the one hand, the users demand cryptocurrency since they want to purchase the
    goods whose quality information is stored in the blockchain system. On the other
    hand, the miners supply cryptocurrency through record keeping.

    in the security level emerges as a surprising result. Put differently, it is not
    always the case that as the blockchain becomes secure the demand for the cryptocurrency
    increases. Given that the higher security enhances the value of blockchain-based
    market for product transactions, this may be a surprising result. We overview
    why and how this result may emerge due to the congestion effect below.

- en: Intuitively, as the security level goes up, the demand for the blockchain-based
    good increases as the chance of getting high-quality goods is higher. This security
    effect increases the demand for cryptocurrency that is needed for the transaction
    therein. However, at the same time, as more buyers flood into the blockchain-based
    market, the price for the cryptocurrency goes up. The price surge drives out some
    of the buyers who would have stayed otherwise. This congestion effect may reduce
    the quantity of cryptocurrency demanded since the size of the blockchain market
    shrinks. Therefore, there are two conflicting forces, the positive security effect
    and the negative congestion effect, that makes the prediction non-monotonic. In
    particular, [Aoyagi and Adachi](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005))

    the above analysis as nesting the case with a centralized authority. One can see
    this by considering the case with only one conceptual “miner” that is allowed
    to enter the token-generating system. The miner, we call as the centralized authority,
    does not mine since it does not have to keep the record in a decentralized manner
    anymore. Instead, it just gives the credentials to all the transactions that come
    across the system. What would the centralized authority do? Since now it may choose
    the security level without the distributed consensus mechanism, it would do so
    to optimize its interest, in this case, the price of the token they would receive
    upon authorization. Here, again, the non-monotonic cryptocurrency price structure
    matters—the centralized authority would take advantage of it and select the optimal
    security level for itself, without considering the appropriate security levels
    for other parties. [Aoyagi and Adachi](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005))

    system with blockchain is higher than that with the centralized ledger. In this
    sense, our consideration is complete with highlighting the benefit of decentralization.

    the cost to operate ASIC (e. g., ASIC machine price, electricity price). When
    the cost increases, fewer miners enter the mining pool. Effectively this enhances
    the cryptocurrency prices because the entry must be more profitable for miners
    that may cover the increased cost of mining. We overviewed that the demand for
    cryptocurrency may decrease or increase in the security level of blockchain. If
    it is falling, then we expect that the cryptocurrency price increases. This prediction
    confirms the intuition discussed by the previous studies. If it is increasing,
    then somewhat surprisingly, the increase in the cost of mining may potentially
    decrease the price of the cryptocurrency. This prediction is first introduced
    by [Aoyagi and Adachi](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-002_ref_005))

    for our story. An example comes from the wine blockchain project outlined above.
    For example, a few wine seller companies introduced the wine blockchain under
    the empirical experiments conducted by EY Advisory and Consulting. The result
    includes the increased unit price of the bottle. This result is consistent with
    our story since the wine blockchain is meant to improve the information stocked
    throughout the supply chain tamper-free, making the average quality of the bottles
    to the final consumers improved. The higher quality translates into higher prices.
    More thorough empirical studies are expected to challenge the story outlined in
    this section.

    for real economic transactions. Throughout the analysis, we emphasized the role
    of decentralization and smart contract for our purpose, leaving a large set of
    interesting aspects blockchains unexplained. We only begin to witness the profound
    real economic consequences in a subset of economic transactions. However, as our
    technical section suggested, we have sophisticated technical backgrounds that
    such impacts are to come. We hope the current monograph helps the reader to frame
    the blockchain and the economic implications.
