    and the nearest town is a meandering five-kilometer walking path through mountains,
    rice paddies, and bamboo forest. Over the past thousand years, everything arrived
    to Shangdiping via this path, hauled by villagers on wooden yokes. Whether it
    was getting your rice dehusked or going to town for a relative’s wedding, you
    traveled this single mountain path. One rainy winter day, I walk along this ancient
    trail guided by a hand-drawn paper map, after hearing about Shangdiping from a
    friend who makes a yearly pilgrimage to this village.

    man nonchalantly blowtorches the pig, while another man, with a cigarette dangling
    from his mouth, holds a shovel over the pig. He vigorously scrapes the pig to
    get the burnt hairs off, the motion jiggling the pig’s legs back and forth. The
    knife is still stuck in the pig’s chest. School has let out for the day and a

    of poverty. Prior to opening the restaurant I eat at, the family had a life defined
    by subsistence farming. The rural village collective allocated each household
    enough land to plant, to feed themselves. Depending on weather and luck, the yearly
    harvest would yield enough food for a year, maybe a little extra if they were
    lucky. Taking care of the land was an incentive in itself, since it determined
    how well your crops would grow the next year.

    extra income back to the family.

    our meal, her long hair uncut for at least a decade, piled on top of her head

    life off that.” Sometimes we play the game or the game plays us. And so Xiao Niu

    among experts in the field of international development on how to do this, especially
    on how to measure poverty in communities that rely on farming. Defining household
    assets is one method, but with farms, depending on the season when you take the
    measurements, assets will change before and after harvest season. Another method
    is quantifying household disposable income—the ability to purchase. It’s these
    on-the-ground variations, compounded into larger macro-economic figures, that
    lead to claims that global poverty is getting much better, or much worse. Yet
    these claims do not answer how people become poor in the first place, and, if

    Dinglou’s land has been planted or tilled, touched by humans in some way, including
    the dead. When villagers die, they are buried in the dusty yellow fields, graves
    marked by small stones, tucked in between plots of vegetables and wheat. While
    sustainable agriculture was practiced in China for thousands of years, the urbanization
    and industrialization of the 1980s pressured villagers to require more from their
    relationship to nature. Being a Taobao village has worsened this, creating added

    some. Children are expected to be filial and pay for parental expenses, returning
    the hard work that parents put into raising them. Distant cousins in rural villages
    will ask wealthy city relatives for business startup funds. This type of payment
    and lending has become so common that the 2019 Chinese New Year’s Spring Festival
    Gala (an annual, widely watched TV event) began with a skit on *sifangqian* (私房钱),
    or one’s private money, and the hijinks of a husband and wife both sneakily sending

    welfare structures and pensions, the family bank becomes ever more necessary to

    of more farming equipment, off Alibaba’s many other e-commerce platforms. Jia

    of collateral that are different from those of city people. A farmer’s assets
    might be pigs or chickens. As a result, Ant Financial is setting up cameras on
    farms that can display a farmer’s assets in real time to help assess credit scores
    and risk in lending scenarios. Such data can also be used by ET Agricultural Brain
    to help farmers with the animal-raising process. With this risk-assessment camera
    in place, farmers can then use Alipay to apply for loans. Already, a chicken farmer

    to apply for RMB 200,000 in loans on Alipay.

- en: These delicate “ice skin” mooncakes have wrappers made of glutinous rice flour
    instead of the traditional wheat flour, making it a delicious, southern-style
    Chinese treat. They are a favorite for the mid-autumn festival.

- en: The filling of these mooncakes is a moon-maize custard, a custard with depth
    that complements the traditional glutinous rice wrappers perfectly. In 2018, the
    first experiments by the China Lunar Exploration Program’s Chang’e 4 moon lander
    established a self-contained ecosystem for agriculture on the moon. It was the
    first time any biological matter grew on the moon.^([4](notes-ch7.xhtml#notes-ch7-4))
    The next missions, Chang’e 5 and 6, advanced moon agriculture. Moon-maize seed
    cultivars were quickly developed by the company Syngenta, and were specially engineered
    to withstand lowered gravitational fields and less water.

- en: While moon living hasn’t taken off as predicted in the past few years, the popularity
    of moon-grown foods has soared. As fires, pollution, and climate change worsened,
    farming on earth produced increasingly low-quality, low-nutrition foods, including
    some vegetables tainted with cadmium or lead. Automated farming on the moon took
    off, in response to upper-middle-class consumer demand. For those who can afford
    it, moon-cultivated foods are not only higher in nutrients but also far healthier.
    Studies have shown that the average lifespan of someone eating earth-cultivated
    foods is about fifty years, while those eating moon-cultivated food since birth
    can live up to a hundred years on average.

    coupled with the unique gravitational field of the moon, give a complex, hearty
    aroma to moon-farmed foods. Moon maize is not just a specialty crop, however.
    Currently, private farming companies are doing research in using small, cost-effective
    UAVs (unmanned autonomous vehicles) for sowing and harvesting, so that everyone
    on earth can access moon-farmed food.

    grown and combines the best of heritage maize with the sweetness of modern corn.
    While these moon-maize mooncakes fetch a hefty price at Hema, you can make them
    at home for a fraction of the cost.

    coconut milk, and vegetable oil in a bowl. Whisk together until smooth—it’s important
    to make sure there are no lumps. The wrapper mix should now be a thick texture,
    similar to glue.

- en: In a large metal bowl, combine butter (sliced into pieces), moon-maize meal,
    powdered cream, and powdered sugar. Place the metal bowl over a pot that has boiling
    water in it, so that the metal bowl functions as a double boiler—this way the
    custard will not stick to the bowl. Stir until butter is melted and contents are
    well mixed. Add the two eggs and whisk until the mixture is smooth. Keep whisking
    until the mixture starts to thicken into a paste. The custard is done once the
    paste no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl or the spatula.

- en: After the wrapper and filling have cooled, put glutinous rice flour on a surface
    to assemble the mooncakes. Measure the wrappers into 20–25 g balls, depending
    on the size of your mold. Measure the filling into 25–30 g balls. Using a rolling
    pin, flatten the wrapper balls. Dust one side of each wrapper with rice flour
    so that it does not stick to the mold. If using a wooden mold, put the wrapper
    on top of the mold. Place filling inside the wrapper. Wrap ends and gently press
    (make sure not to press too forcefully, otherwise the filling might break through).
    Remove from mold. Dust the mooncakes with rice flour before storing so that they
    do not stick to each other.
