- en: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have turned up as a promising technology due
    to their deployment nature and the knock-off feature of cost-effectiveness. The
    rapid increase in the demand for wireless applications has opened up new security
    vulnerabilities which are related to their infrastructure-less nature and their
    nature of transmission and hence made WSNs the centre point of attraction for
    attackers and intruders. Machine Learning has embedded comprehensive solutions
    to accord with modern security breaches. It has gained a mark of deterrent technology
    by shoring up the infrastructure of security through mapping security breaches
    and performing the identification of unknown patterns. This chapter focuses on
    the illustration of security breaches in wireless sensor networks along with the
    glimpse of reduction in attacks through dynamic algorithms and strategies of Machine
    Learning. We have proposed some feature selection methodologies in order to identify
    the best features out of the available network dataset. These feature selection
    methods are evaluated against the existing machine learning classifiers in order
    to identify the best feature selection strategy and the best classifier.

    wireless sensor networks have marked their presence in various application areas
    of medicine, military, smart spaces, and many others. A wireless sensor network

    event-driven. In event-driven sensor networks, the network triggers as soon as
    it senses changes in the monitored area, whereas, in demand-driven, the network
    serves as an updated database for a client. Wireless sensor networks are comprised
    of several tiny sensor nodes that are deployed either randomly or deterministically
    [1]. These nodes gather the data from the environment and transmit the sensed
    data to the base stations for further processing. WSNs provide cross-layer design
    and scalability along with the capacity to handle the failure of nodes. Different
    types of sensors such as seismic, magnetic, visual, *etc*. are embedded within
    the WSNs, thereby monitoring ambient situations.

    processing power, and limited energy. Based on the nature of nodes, wireless sensor
    networks are classified into two types of networks, namely homogeneous and heterogeneous
    sensor networks. A network where all sensor nodes have a similar property for
    communication, memory, energy, and reliability is termed a homogeneous network
    [2]. Due to the nature of transmission of wireless networks, security has become
    a critical issue. Not only security but the designers of wireless sensor networks
    must also focus on the issues related to the reliability of data, aggregation
    of data, and fault detection. Since the sensor nodes are capable of operating
    both in ad hoc networks as well as the normal networks, security goals could be
    categorized into two types; Primary Security Goals and Secondary Security Goals.

    networks has contributed to the growth of WSNs. They are made up of cost-effective
    sensor nodes that release a high amount of energy. Several characteristics make
    WSNs prone to security attack which includes resource-constrained nature of sensor
    nodes and ad hoc deployment of nodes. The basic requirement for WSNs to survive
    includes reliability, availability, and energy efficiency. Denial of service attacks
    and eavesdropping attacks targets the confidentiality and integrity of the data
    being transmitted over the network, and Flooding and Jamming attacks are related
    to the power consumption of the network [3-4]. Hence it can be stated that there
    are several security attacks that target the sensitive points of WSNs, such as
    Bandwidth, Power, and Routing Mechanism of WSNs, thus opening up new gateways
    for intruders. WSNs are more vulnerable to Man in the Middle-Security Attack as
    they provide complete control over information that is transmitted over the network.

    and declares itself to be the neighbor of other nodes by sending out Hello messages.
    When a node receives this message it assumes that the node is in communication

    of nodes in a network. IDS for the detection uses a statistical tool based on
    binary logistic regression. This system takes node parameters for malicious behavior
    as input. This m- ID was deployed in real-time using various network topologies.
    Ioannou *et al*. [16] proposed twenty-four malicious scenarios for each network
    topology and attack. Later a machine learning technique for the detection of spoofing
    attacks in wireless sensor networks was developed. Two machine learning classifiers
    were hybridized to process and analyze the samples of signals for the detection
    of attacks. The K means algorithm and K-NN algorithm were the machine learning
    algorithms used in this technique. De *et al*. [17] proposed an algorithm for
    optimization of scenarios where the attacking and legitimate nodes are either
    at the same distance or placed at a very close distance from one another. This
    approach resulted in a 10% increase in the accuracy as compared to one of the

    the rate of drop-in packets. A dynamic threshold value is considered for the detection
    of wormhole attacker nodes followed by the clustering technique for the selection
    of optimistic communication paths. Simulation of WSNs coding organization is performed
