- en: Moving away from the Bitworker to now consider the macro-level effects of these
    disruptive triumvirate technologies, our main concern must be the lack of uniformity
    in how these benefits are received, perhaps allocated, across societies. The commoditisation
    of previously skilled and semi-skilled labour may further marginalise many within
    the ever increasing left-behind who fail to receive the benefits of globalisation
    and technological enhancements relative to often the incumbent power and educated
    classes. The consequences for how this may play out in our politics and international
    affairs would be of concern to us all and arguably not a world within which we
    would wish to live and work. Indeed, protections must be in place to ensure that
    workers are not exploited and perhaps more importantly, do not perceive themselves
    to be exploited.

- en: The tokenisation and market pricing of labour across new technological platforms
    such as decentralised labour exchanges (DEXs), although efficient, must not proceed
    unchecked at a macroeconomic level. Such protections at a governmental or regulatory
    level might include minimum per unit (Bit task) pricing equivalent to a national
    minimum wage or national living wage. Additional mechanisms may also include restrictions
    on the amount, or proportion, of time that an individual is permitted to forward
    sell on these new markets. The objective of such a proposal would be twofold.
    Firstly, Bitworkers who are in demand would obviously be able to forward sell
    a larger amount of their future work time, for example, an architect may be able
    to say seven years of their future work given that she is in high demand whereas
    an underwriter only two years because comparatively there is less demand or perhaps
    concern about ultimate job replacement owing to automation.

- en: You would be forgiven for wondering what the problem is with selling your future
    self. Surely it is a good thing with the future worker? Such an arrangement would
    provide a guarantee of future income and the provision of work, and with such
    certainty workers such as the architect above will be able to better plan financially
    as well as access financial products such as loans and mortgages for a lower fee
    because they represent a reduced risk given that their future work is guaranteed.
    This upside must however be contrasted against the status quo of today. The forward
    contract above is much more restrictive than a contract of employment. Indeed,
    once committed, should you suffer ill health or perhaps a change of location or
    career is desired, you would have to compensate the counterparty of the contract
    who is essentially the person or institution who has purchased your future time.
    Similar to that of a professional footballer – a five-year contract with Manchester
    United Football Club is to be celebrated in providing you with certainty of income,
    but ultimately you are tied to that club for that period of time irrespective
    of the performance of the team and any changes in your preferred location or club
    going forward.

- en: Secondly, consideration must be given to the protections afforded to more senior
    workers under such future market-oriented arrangements. As a future worker approaches
    retirement, it may be the case that the market prices their work differently compared
    to that of a senior worker – particularly more physical work where a *Bit task*
    such as a day of scaffolding maybe priced at a discount by the market owing to
    the inevitable reduction in physical ability associated with older age which comes
    to us all. These off market price variations could punitively affect the incomes
    of our more senior workers, the corollary of which would be discounted younger
    worker rates, although the later may be more acceptable in a future economy because
    such workers will be less skilled or experienced.

    the seller of the option contract would receive the premium and the buyer of the
    option would pay the premium. Such a transaction in the secondary markets could
    be traded and recorded on a decentralised exchange using a blockchain platform,
    which let us not forget is simply a ledger or database capable of real-time use
    by multiple stakeholders. Stakeholders interested in the trading of such contracts
    would be speculators, corporations, trade unions and individuals to name but a
    few. Simply, speculators have little interest in procuring or selling the future
    labour but rather they take a view whether this contract is under or overpriced
    today then trade accordingly. For example, if I believe that demand for solicitors
    in Singapore will increase going forward owing to my expectation for a buoyant
    property market over the next half decade then I would also expect the market
    rate for conveyancing labour to increase with the passage of time. This option
    contract gives the holder the right to sell such labour for USD 800.00 per day.
    However, if the labour rate increases to USD 1,000.00 per day then the option
    is *out of the money* as who would want to sell at USD 800.00 using this option
    contract when they could sell at USD 1,000.00 in the open market? Consequently,
    the premium would fall to say USD 6,500.00 to reflect this. A speculator with
    the above opinions on future market movements would therefore sell the above put
    option today for USD 14,500.00 then buy it back in the future for USD 6,500.00,
    thereby making an USD 8,000.00 profit per put option contract. Notice that at
    no time does the speculator have any need for the underlying asset – the labour.
    It should also be understood that the maximum gain for this short put trade is
    USD 14,500.00 in the scenario where the premium falls to a price near nil. However,
    the maximum loss is potentially infinite and would occur when demand for such
    labour plummets allowing holders of the put option to sell at the guaranteed price
    of USD 800.00 per day which in turn would make the option contract desirable and
    the premium would rise.^([1](#fn1))

    in buying such a put option as it afford them future income protection. If you
    were such a conveyancing solicitor in Singapore and you wished to protect your
    future income owing to your mortgage repayment obligations, then the purchase
    of this option would assist you. Your risk would be a reduction in your future
    wage below USD 800.00 per day. If this occurred, the put option above would be
    *in the money* and would allow the holder to sell said labour at a rate which
    is now greater than the prevailing market rate. The premium would increase to
    reflect this and the solicitor could sell the contract to close their position
    for a profit which will offset their employment losses in the real world. The
    upshot being that they can now meet their mortgage repayments as they fall due
    using both their now reduced employment income alongside their derivatives trading
    profit. In summary, this trade has afforded the worker, or collection of workers,
    a minimum wage but at a cost. Insurance always comes at a cost. It seems unlikely
    that future *Bitworkers* will become expert in derivatives trading with respect
    to their own labour. Perhaps more reasonably such protections will be managed
    by trade unions or DCOPs, in return for a fee, on behalf of a pool of workers
    in a common profession.

    option contracts. Presently, many corporates engage in hedging strategies to mitigate
    external price fluctuations of variables (such as commodity prices) which are
    important to their business operations. This is recorded in their accounts under
    International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39\. It therefore follows that these employers
    would be keen to manage their often significant employment costs in a similar
    way. To continue with our example, a legal firm in Singapore would be exposed
    to increasing wage demands from their staff. They would therefore need to trade
    the previous put option such that as the wage rate increases they will make money
    from their derivative trade which will offset their loss in the commercial world.
    The employing legal firm will therefore sell the put option now for USD 14,500.00\.
    If the wage rate then begins to climb in the commercial world, the put option
    premium will fall as it will become less desirable to hold. The employer will
    then buy the put option back to close out their position making said gain.

- en: A well-functioning secondary market for these derivatives would allow trade
    unions to negotiate pay deals with employers through these disintermediated markets
    rather than protracted rounds of negotiations, brinkmanship and the potential
    threat of strike action. Unions could facilitate the sale of blocks of aggregated
    future labour time for their membership ensuring that they receive the best possible
    market rate. However, it is questionable whether the marketisation of future labour
    would enable workers of the future to receive better pay deals using this mechanism.
    Despite this price (wage rate) uncertainty, the forward sale of future labour
    would serve as an enhanced retainer system of sorts providing the worker with
    security that hitherto was not there. However, that does beg the question of what
    would happen if either counterparty was unable to provide or consume labour? For
    example, the employer closed their operation and had no need of the future labour,
    or perhaps the worker wished to move location of careers and therefore was unwilling
    to make good on their commitment for future labour. In any well-functioning economy
    such flexibility is required. Provisions would therefore need to be incorporated
    into the legal terms (or indenture) of such derivatives making provision for such
    occurrences and perhaps a mechanism for financial compensation in either direction.
    Leaving prepaid employment early may therefore require the worker to buy themselves
    out of the contract to which they are presently engaged.

    raw materials, retail space and human resources. It may therefore be the case
    that in such a world rival employers, and perhaps even nation states may seek
    to buy up strategically important future labour time in order to profit or even
    block the development of a competitors business played out and planned using game
    theory scenario optimisation. Notwithstanding this possibility, the ability to
    nationalise a current private industry now becomes infinitely more complex. For
    example, the Labour Party (the official opposition in the UK) have pledged to
    renationalise the rail system in the UK should they come to power. However, in
    a world where labour can be traded and forward sold not only would the assets
    and businesses be required to be bought by the state in a nationalisation process
    but also any associated future labour time in that industry.

- en: Perhaps more interestingly, this also offers the opportunity for a new hybrid
    type of nationalisation, namely *nationalisation of labour*. This would involve
    the state purchasing all future labour available in a given industry deemed to
    be of national importance. This would allow the political powers of the day to
    ensure fair wages and conditions which is usually a key driver for nationalisation
    in the first place. Critically however, the assets of businesses could remain
    in private hands and would not be part of the nationalisation process thereby
    making such an effort cheaper for the state and ergo the taxpayer likewise. In
    addition, moving industry from state to private hands is often a cumbersome, costly
    and lengthy process. It is typically a seismic decision made and desired infrequently
    due to these prohibitive costs and the politically charged opinions on both sides
    of the debate as to whether an industry belongs in state or private hands. This
    new *nationalisation of labour* process which we propose is quicker and less prohibitive
    but also quicker to implement in either direction granting Governments more flexibility
    in their decisions regarding nationalisation or otherwise.

    strategies of leading central banks, you may have been forgiven for thinking that
    our debt capacity at the national, corporate and personal levels is nearing, or
    at, saturation. According to the United Nations (2017) report, total worldwide
    debt exceeded 300% of GDP compared with a prefinancial crisis measurement 10 years
    earlier of just 200% of GDP in 2007\. Our hypothesised future world of *Bitworkers*,
    *Bit tasks*, *DCOPs* and *DEXs* all enabled by the technological characteristics
    of our *triumvirate* may further increase this trend. Growing income security,
    albeit perhaps at a lower wage rate, will increase the propensity of lenders to
    lend larger amounts, for longer at cheaper rates. This is due to individuals in
    particular now having more certainty about their future cash income streams and
    therefore representing lower risk loan recipients thereby increasing their individual
    debt capacity further still.

    the effect at the macro-level and the second-order impact upon the worker may
    be profound. Arguably, the strategy for such corporates is that in addition to
    the provision of goods and services to their target customers they will now also
    provide them with the cryptocurrency monetary system with which their customers
    can purchase said goods and services. In a joint statement in September 2019 both
    France and Germany’s Finance Ministers reacted strongly explaining that, ‘no private
    entity can claim monetary power, which is inherent to the sovereignty of nations’.
    Nonetheless, the development of what may become corporate central banks is possible.
    Moreover, we could see them issuing their own currency backed by fiat currency
    one-for-one. Then, encourage customers and employees to use it thereby stimulating
    demand, before removing the asset backing akin to the removal of the gold standard
    in the previous century to give us the fiat currencies that we use as our functional
    currencies today. The timing of the tipping point when trust of the corporate
    exceeds trust of the sovereign nation to facilitate this unpegging would paramount
    in the success or failure of a non-sovereign currency.

- en: Changing tack slightly, we must also consider the changing administration and
    payment of employment taxes for the worker of the future, at both the employer
    and employee level. Presently, such taxes are typically deducted at source for
    employed persons with a frequency of weekly or monthly in arrears. The employer
    is responsible for such deductions as well as the payment of their own employment
    taxes to the tax authority in aggregate. For self-employed persons, the burden
    of tax owing and payments to be made falls squarely upon their own shoulders given
    the absence of an employer. This usually involves an annual or biannual submission,
    or self-assessment, along with responsibility for such workers to maintain appropriate
    records to substantiate their tax paid, or not paid as the case may be. Furthermore,
    documentary evidence to substantiate earnings and tax allowable expenses to reduce
    profits, and therefore taxes owed, must be retained for many years. In the UK,
    for example, this is required for seven years. This administrative burden can,
    and should, be relieved by the virtues of a blockchain ledger which can host data
    (invoices and receipts), to substantiate both earning and deductions in an immutable
    form which tax authorities can evaluate with confidence.

- en: However, it is the blockchain-enabled currencies of the future which perhaps
    deliver the largest changes in this area of the economy. Irrespective of whether
    the future of money is cryptocurrencies, corporate currencies, the securitised
    self or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), one thing is clear – the continued
    trend is for cheaper, faster and more transparent transactions. It is this reduction
    in the cost of transactions to nil or near-nil costs that will enable the previously
    discussed Internet of Things economy by virtue of the newly found viability for
    the microtransactions. Such transactions were previously oftentimes crowded out
    by fees, but in this future scenario, the propensity to spend and earn in smaller
    discrete units is now possible. If payment is possible in smaller increments of
    time, it therefore follows that the tendering and allocation of tasks in smaller
    time units will also perhaps occur. This further supports the potential for work
    to be tendered and performed in increasingly small units of time as proposed in
    our *Bit task* above. Similarly, for taxation, the worker of the future will be
    remunerated at the microtask and therefore also the microtransaction level. The
    contemporaneous production, consumption and payment for economic activity remove
    significant friction from value-added economic activities thereby improving the
    economy as a whole. Furthermore, the necessity for monthly, quarterly, biannual
    or annual payments to national tax authorities may no longer be required. Instead,
    taxation owed will be accrued and paid in real time thereby reducing the bureaucracy
    of tax accounting and payments, which not least will negate the need for extensive
    accounting rules in this area regarding the over- or underpayment of tax owed,
    for example, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheets
    of corporate entities. These balances are in essence only due to timing differences
    caused by our technological inefficiencies which in our envisioned future ‘world
    of work’ will no longer be evident therefore mitigating the need for an entire
    accounting standard –IAS 12 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities. No mean feat
    a measure of the potential impact of these new technologies!

    thus far, although not without its challenges, would appear to be one in which
    workers are technologically enabled, with greater future income security and with
    less administrative drag. However, this perspective will likely not accrue to
    all members of society in a uniform manner. As previously discussed, demographics
    of perhaps older non-professional work activities are perhaps more likely to miss
    out on these advantages owing to the lower price point, lack of desirability and
    overall commoditisation of their worker behaviour. At the political level, this
    will take extreme sensitivity and creativity of policymaking to ensure equity
    and support in the interests of a cohesive society. Often in nature and economics,
    we may expect to observe a Pareto Effect here, more commonly known as the 80:20
    rule. Founded upon the research of the medieval economist Vilfredo Pareto, he
    found that 80% of the wealth of a nation might reasonably be expected to be wielded
    by just 20% of the population. Moving forward, we observe that modern businesses
    might expect for 80% of their profits to accrue from just 20% of their customer
    base, or perhaps that they spend 80% of their labour time servicing just 20% of
    their customers by number. If a *Pareto Effect* is observed in the disruption
    which is to come in the future of work, it seems unpalatable that any economy
    could stomach one fifth of their working population being left-behind. The societal
    disruption would be significant, to say the least, and would add further fuel
    to the fire behind the rise of angry societies and populism trends the world over.
    However, should these changes manifest over a generation rather than a much shorter
    timeframe then becomes more plausible that such changes could creep into normal
    being in our economy. Similarly, the previously discussed halving of trade union
    membership over the previous generation discussed earlier demonstrates how significant
    change can take hold if introduced over a generation rather than a short period
    of time.

    the triumvirate is to mirror the technological disruption at the political and
    central bank level also? However, for us to think of this as an implementation
    is perhaps somewhat inaccurate. As with all paradigm shifting technological innovations,
    it is difficult for regulatory powers and nation states to hold their technological
    adoption at bay. This is especially true for cryptocurrencies which although they
    have failed to achieve significant adoption they have failed to go away quite
    simply because the benefits which they bring are too great to warrant their elimination.
    Although, it should also be noted that to ‘get rid’ of such cryptocurrencies would
    present some significant challenges, for example, the use of quantum computing
    to undermine a decentralised community, convincing global users that there should
    be no demand for such currencies or perhaps a uniform global electrical switch-off
    in order to render the underlying blockchain ledger as irreparably damaged. It
    is for these reasons why it seems likely that cryptocurrencies will be present
    and therefore have an impact in our future world of work despite the fact that
    we cannot presently identify which of the non-mutually exclusive forms of possible
    future money depicted in the previous diagram will ultimately become dominant.
    The notion of a dominant design or dominant logic is apparent here perhaps more
    so because we are discussing a standard unit of account based upon technological
    fundamentals. Historically, our technological evolution has seen the creation
    of new technologies which bring both good and bad facets from a societal and economic
    perspective; examples include: the telephone, the internet, electricity and now
    the algorithms, blockchain and cryptocurrency (ABC) of our triumvirate. Extrapolating
    this impact at a national and supranational level, we could perhaps envisage a
    decentralised world bank. This would be transparent by design and would allow
    the global financial system to form a meta decentralised DCOP to better support
    the workers of the future at the regional, national and global levels. With a
    mandate to control inflation and provide full employment where possible we may
    go further and see the creation of an algorithmic welfare state. Such a welfare
    system would build upon the seminal work of Wood et al. (2019) who discuss the
    autonomy and algorithmic control in a global gig economy with a particular focus
    upon online labour platforms. These labour platforms upon which their study is
    based are in existence today and seek to match providers of paid work with potential
    workers. However, at a global level, we might anticipate that such platform solutions
    may become problematic for two key reasons. Firstly, owing to the fact that such
    organisations are often for-profit then invariably some of the value which is
    exchanged between worker and the provider of work will be lost to the private
    enterprise. If however, such an allocation of labour was performed on the previously
    discussed DEXs then this value would be retained by the counterparties rather
    than lost to the platform or website. Furthermore, one might envisage that particularly
    with semi-skilled and non-skilled labour that there is the propensity for the
    equilibrium labour rates to disproportionately fall as we perhaps see a race to
    the bottom in willing labour to be performed at ever lower rates in return for
    scarce work. Akin to a reverse auction theory and the winner’s curse it could
    be hypothesised that left unchecked then labour at the individual level may lose
    out in the performance of labour at rates less than their individual marginal
    utility. Once again, we might perhaps return to the role trade unions and how
    if such technological frameworks are put in place then our need for such organisations
    will increase in order to mitigate the race to the bottom risk.'

    further postulate that the associated welfare might flex in tandem with these
    labour exchanges, ultimately being controlled by algorithms. The algorithmic welfare
    state would draw upon many of the principles discussed by Rosenblat and Stark
    (2016) to enable verification of worker status and need in terms of whether a
    welfare payment or support is required. Theoretically, this could be applied in
    real time and would help to plug the gig economy slack which arguably current
    and future workers are/will experience. Presently, an agency worker has uncertainty
    of income by definition but when welfare support is warranted and much needed
    by the worker it is unable to flex in alignment with the provision of work. Often
    workers must wait many weeks for welfare systems (and payments!) to catch up oftentimes
    not due to cash flow reasons but rather overly bureaucratic and old systems which
    are unable to keep pace with the new economic environment and technologically
    enhanced normative work denominated in *Bit tasks*. Such a dynamic welfare system
    would allow the flexibility of work performed and work provision to more ably
    flourish owing to the reduced hurdles in using such a platform for income provision
    from the perspective of the worker. If future workers have surety of welfare support
    during fallow times, even at the Bit task level, then the risk of such work and
    associated income streams diminishes. A welfare state which is able to algorithmically
    verify your eligibility for welfare support and pay that in response to small
    periods of time when work provision is unavailable is technologically possible.
    In such a world, a future worker may in the course of a single day completed a
    dozen or so tasks for as many organisations whilst also receiving a 7% welfare
    support for the 1 hour and 20 minutes during which work was unavailable. The aggregate
    outcome being a living wage is perhaps met if not exceeded. Furthermore, because
    these welfare payments and Bit task engagements would likely be hosted on an immutable
    underlying blockchain, or similar, then the state can also with confidence levy
    taxes using similar time increments. If such a system is reliable enough to substantiate
    welfare payments then it is also reliable enough to warrant income tax deductions
    at source. A near frictionless system! Larger-scale events could also be verified
    by oracles and feed into such taxation and welfare cash movements. Example might
    include: marriage tax allowances, family credit tax support post the birth of
    a son or daughter or perhaps automatic statutory sick pay when verified to an
    external system signed-off by a medical doctor. The advantages to such a verifiable
    and real-time system are evident. However, by virtue of the fact that algorithms
    will be able to see and therefore evaluate holistically at the Bitworker level
    it will mean that taxation, for instance, is levied and paid at the appropriate
    marginal rate even if a worker is drawing income from multiple Bit task engagements
    concurrently. The worker onus to keep records, declare and pay taxation at fixed
    time points is therefore removed thereby allowing the worker to earn in a more
    uniform and predictable manner which reduces risk despite no change in the per
    annum after tax cash inflows.'

    that as part of the allocation process of labour workers are able to stipulate
    a preferred remuneration currency however what is more likely is that the currency
    denomination of advertised work will be fixed therefore forcing the worker to
    bear the risk. A possible solution to this may be the transference of exchange
    rate risk to the tax authority in that non-fiat currencies could be accepted to
    settle tax payments. Even if acceptable it should be noted that firstly nation
    states may be unwilling to allow this as it legitimises the unrecognised currency
    of earnings potentially to the detriment of their own national fiat currency.
    Nonetheless, this may not be as outlandish as it first sounds because presently
    the state of Ohio in the USA permits payment of local taxes by individuals in
    the form of Bitcoin, and has done so since early 2019.^([3](#fn3)) Secondly, taxes
    may only represent 10–50% of outgoings of an individual depending upon their tax
    strategy and domicile. It is likely that outgoings will largely be denominated
    in fiat currency and would typically include: mortgage repayments, utility bills,
    credit card fees, loans and general spending. Such exchange rate risk could simply
    be absorbed by the individual or perhaps could be neutralised with an extremely
    low-cost algorithmic broker who would convert incoming currencies to the required
    outgoing currencies to create a near perfect match in real time. From the future
    workers perspective, the notion of exchange rate risk therefore becomes a moot
    point.'

- en: Overall, if managed correctly in a manner where the technology is not curtailed
    by regulation or legal restriction, the potential advantages for the Bitworker
    of the macro-economy are significant. Friction is largely removed, taxation and
    earnings automated, and all are supported by a similarly efficient algorithmic
    welfare state provision. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that the incumbent political
    economic powers will relinquish control in full, and indeed perhaps it would be
    unwise to do so. A hybrid of our suggestions above may therefore one day become
    a reality. What is clear presently though is that the gig, and subsequent post-gig,
    economies are moving faster than our existing systems of taxation, welfare and
    pension provision can keep pace with. The triumvirate that is our ABCs may assist
    in calibrating this difference in the economies of the future.
