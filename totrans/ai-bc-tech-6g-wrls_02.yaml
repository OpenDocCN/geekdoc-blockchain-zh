- en: In this chapter, different technologies envisioned for 6G and beyond wireless
    networks are discussed. We start with cell-free massive MIMO(Multiple Input Multiple
    Output), which solves the issues faced by the current network's cell-centric (small
    cell) approach by providing ‘truly ubiquitous connectivity everywhere. The next-generation
    network is slated to involve very complex computations due to the number of users
    and various applications; this could be solved by quantum computing (leading to
    quantum communication). The current wireless network faces propagation issues
    in the wireless environment, thus limiting its performance. An intelligent communication
    environment will enable the environment to become ‘smart’ by employing unique
    materials in the surrounding facilitating hassle-free propagation of electromagnetic
    waves. Migration to a higher level in the spectrum reduces the wavelength of EM
    waves which enables the sizes of devices to be reduced and is used in very advanced
    applications like nano cameras, among others. Due to terrain, it is not possible
    to provide network infrastructure everywhere; CubeSats (a small satellite) can
    be employed to give seamless connections to not only those terrains but also applications
    like monitoring events and mobility, among others, making the Internet of Space
    Things (IoST) pivotal for 6G and beyond the network. The current wireless network
    faces many complex optimization problems which can be solved very easily by employing
    machine learning or deep learning (as suggested by the literature) algorithms
    making artificial intelligence extremely crucial for 6G and beyond the network.
    Then we discuss different key 6G and beyond technologies such as Terahertz band
    Communication, UAV-Based Communication, Visible Light Communication, Ambient Backscatter
    Communication, Context-aware cognitive radio and Reconfigurable Transceiver Front-ends
    for 6G and beyond.

- en: Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) has many advantages over conventional
    MIMO. For instance, mMIMO has at least ten times better spectral efficiency and
    much higher spatial resolution than the latter. However, mMIMO suffers from large
    variations in signal-to-noise ratio between cell center and cell edge users, leading
    to poor service to cell edge users. This issue can be solved using the smaller
    cell, wherein a base station/Access Point (AP) serves a particular smaller geographical
    area. However, the installation of smaller cells leads to very high inter-cell
    interference, which mars the network's performance. Therefore, a paradigm shift
    of the network is needed from a cellular network to a cell-free network. Recently,
    cell-free massive MIMO has been proposed, which overcomes the issues mentioned
    above. In cell-free massive MIMO, all the APs are connected to the Central Processing
    Unit (CPU) via parallel fronthaul links and jointly serve the User Equipment (UE)
    in a particular geographical area without considering any cell boundary. In the
    next section, we discuss different architectures of cell-free massive MIMO.

    without applications of Machine Learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep
    Learning (DL). The reason for this is very obvious. The next-generation wireless
    network will involve millions of diverse applications serving billions of devices
    ranging from D-2-D, M-2-M, IoT and handheld devices. Deep Learning (DL) has the
    ability to solve a problem involving complex optimization very efficiently. For
    example, the problem of resource allocation in heterogeneous networks, routing
    problems and network management are all very complex non-convex optimization problems.
    The literature shows these problems are solved very efficiently and easily by
    employing DL [[12](#CR12)–[16](#CR16)]. The adoption of DL is all set to bring
    a paradigm shift in the future wireless network. In the subsection below, important

    problems relating to resource allocation [[5](#CR5)]. This can be attributed to
    four reasons. Firstly, the decision made by RL algorithms is highly repetitive,
    thereby generating a large amount of training data for RL algorithms. Secondly,
    the RL approach has the ability to model complex systems and decision-making policies
    as game-playing agents. Thirdly, for problems that are difficult to be modeled
    accurately, the RL frameworks can be used for such problems if there exists a
    reward signal that correlates with the objective. Lastly, the RL agent has the
    ability to optimize for any specific workload by performing well under varying
    conditions. Therefore, owing to the nature of problem reinforcement, learning
    is best suited for resource allocation/management [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)].

    data to nearby devices, among others. Since these sensors are not connected to
    any infrastructure, they need long-lasting battery life. Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) is one such technology that can help cater to this need. RFID exploits
    backscatter communication techniques. In backscatter communication, the reflected
    signal (from RF source) has impinged on a backscatter transmitter, which modulates
    and sends it back to the receiver. In ambient backscatter, the communication transmitter
    can harvest energy from surrounding owing to radiated EM waves from base station/AP,
    among others, and thereby use the simple circuit for modulation for reflecting
    it toward the receiver [[5](#CR5)].

    be placed in closed proximity among the RF sources and backscatter transmitter.

    of Deep Learning (DL) will solve complex problems efficiently and reduce computational
    complexity. Technologies like UAV can be used at the time of natural calamity
    to ensure the reliability of the network. To achieve terabits/second of data rate,
    THz band can be exploited, while Visible Light Communication can be used for achieving
    extremely high data rate communication for short-range communication. These technologies
    will change the wireless network to provide the best user experience and satisfy
    the expectations of end-users.
