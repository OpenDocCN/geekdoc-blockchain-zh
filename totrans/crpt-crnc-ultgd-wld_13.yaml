- en: For years, many people have been interested in investing in the stock market,
    mutual funds, Federal Bonds, IRAs, and all sorts of investment tools. In many
    cases, they have been prevented because the capital to get into these instruments
    is often out of reach for the average person. This keeps the profit potential
    squarely in the hands of the wealthy with only a few others getting in the privilege.

- en: Probably the easiest way to make money is by trading Bitcoin. With Bitcoin,
    you can trade with every other cryptocurrency on the market. All you need to do
    is buy the Bitcoin, scour the market for a better price and then sell it again.
    When trading with other currencies, always make sure you’re trading for a currency
    you can sell later. When the price reaches a point where you can turn a profit,
    simply sell it and reap the rewards

- en: Lending is perhaps the oldest way to use the money to make money. Basically,
    you loan out money to a relevant party, and they pay you back, with interest.
    Interest rates will vary with the risk involved. If you get collateral in exchange
    for your loan, interest rates will be low. No collateral means higher risks, but
    it also means higher interest rates.

    bank and choose who you’d like to invest your money in. With Smart Contracts,
    you can even set your own terms and conditions for the loans and then receive
    regular payments from your benefactor with interest.

    long term. While the price fluctuates greatly from day to day, the overall trend
    has been consistently on the rise. The longer you hold onto it, the better your
    chances of a larger return on your investment.
