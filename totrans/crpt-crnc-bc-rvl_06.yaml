    Satoshi Nakamoto remained mostly silent and hidden. In fact, since December 2011,
    Nakamoto has essentially disappeared. On March 6, 2014, they sent a simple, five-worded
    message—“I am not Dorian Nakamoto.” This was in reference to a Dorian Satoshi
    Nakamoto, a former CIA computer coder in Los Angeles who, because of his name,
    had been hounded by the media as the founder of Bitcoin. That was the real Nakamoto’s
    last public message.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many have speculated as to why Nakamoto has withdrawn from any kind of public
    life. The most obvious reason is that Nakamoto could be worth billions of dollars
    and, as such, a target for criminals. Another is that Nakamoto wants to keep as
    much focus on their creation, Bitcoin, as possible so that the system becomes
    more secure and trusted. Finally, however, Nakamoto may fear the collective power
    of governments, states, and financiers who sit atop the current system based on
    fiat currency. Given the threat Bitcoin may pose to this system—and the ways it
    has been useful to non-state actors such as criminals, drug traders, and terrorists—Nakamoto
    may be wise to keep themselves anonymous.

    a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.”'

    Dorian Nakamoto.

    After falling in value by almost 75 percent in 2018, Bitcoin, against most expectations,
    began to rise again. The catalyst appeared to be a sudden change in monetary policy
    from the world’s most important central bank: the US Federal Reserve. In January
    2019 the Federal Reserve announced it would begin loosening its monetary policy
    because the economy was weakening and investors had grown nervous.'
