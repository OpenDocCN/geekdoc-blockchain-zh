- en: Tokenization, an integral component of blockchain technology, has emerged as
    the feature that is creating innovative applications of blockchain technology
    since 2018, and is progressing at a rapid pace. There apparently is a desire to
    “tokenize” almost all types of asset classes on blockchain, including real estate,
    painting, diamonds, stocks among many others. These asset classes are sometimes
    difficult to transfer or sub-divide, hence buyers and sellers exchange “paper”
    or legal deeds that represent the ownership in all or part of the asset. As with
    paper trail, the property deeds and titles are often difficult to transfer and
    to track. Commodity exchanges, in developed countries, have largely eliminated
    paper records and substituted those with electronic records. The electronic records
    still however rely on trusted parties and secure storage, increasing the overhead
    costs of operation. Hence, a solution is digitization and wide dispersion of records,
    or maintaining the record on blockchain.

- en: Tokenizing assets is using digital representation to prove ownership of real
    assets. Even presently when one purchases a high value asset, like a house, a
    boat or a car, the buyer gets a paper-record of the purchase in addition to the
    physical possession of the asset. In the United States, we call it the “title”
    for the house or the car. Traditionally, the title is issued by a government entity
    after verification of the terms of sale and payment. They also verify that the
    seller was the rightful owner of the property and therefore had the “right to
    sell.” The government agency acts as a “trusted third party” in this transaction,
    collecting a recording fee and providing an assurance on the validity of the sale,
    and keeping record of rightful owners of the property. In a digitized world, digital
    tokens are used to prove ownership in real assets. These records are maintained
    online and can be accessed at any time and by anyone. Tokens can expedite and
    facilitate the process of buying and selling by eliminating the delay of having
    the records verified by government agencies. This feature opens up the tokenized
    asset to a wider market and previously untapped potential investor base.

- en: One of the earliest successful applications of tokenization has been in the
    domain of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). With the increased interest in utility
    tokens and security tokens, it is a natural progression to tokenize other asset
    classes. Digital tokens can be used to prove ownership in physical assets. Digital
    tokens can either be created through ICO or Security Token Offering (STO). The
    tokens represent a share in the underlying asset and are initially sold by the
    owner of the asset. Once issued, the security tokens can trade in secondary markets.
    The holder of the token can hold on to the token until the underlying asset is
    disposed of and the resolution reached, or they could trade the tokens in secondary
    markets which will adjust the price of the token to be commensurate with the value
    of the asset. As the value of the asset increases, so does the price of the token,
    and vice versa.

    kinds. Next, we present illustrations of the concept and how tokenization is actually
    operationalized. We next discuss some of the emerging use-cases of tokenization.
    These use-cases are still in developmental stages. We then summarize the process
    of tokenization and the anticipated growth potential. We conclude the chapter
    with a discussion of the prevailing risks and comparing tokenization with securitization
    of assets. There are many similarities between the two approaches, hence the lessons
    learnt from the 2008 global financial crisis should be revisited in the context
    of tokenization.

    the “trusted broker” who currently maintains and updates records after each transaction.
    Since tokenization allows for digital exchange of assets, without the need for
    physical exchange, it eases many complications and provides the opportunity for
    vast improvement over current practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With tokenization, it will be easier to prove partial or full ownership. Since
    the assets are traded in digitized version, and the records of each and every
    transaction is maintained in a blockchain, current ownership can be verified in
    real time, around the world, 24/7, 365 days a year. There will no longer be the
    need to visit a government official, during regular working hours, pay a fee,
    and wait in long queues to enquire about property records to verify ownership.
    It can be done at anytime, anywhere in the world, with an internet connection
    and a smart device.
  prefs: []

    expedite the process of transacting. The transactions could occur and be settled
    with the records updated in a matter of seconds. Currently, most security transactions
    take about a day or two to be fully executed, and real estate properties about
    a week or month to settle, especially when parties to the transaction are spread
    all over the world. The ease of buying or selling digital token will increase
    the flow of funds and reduce the friction inherent in conversion of tangible property
    to currency or other liquid assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tokenization will increase liquidity of holding the digitized asset as it can
    be converted to and from currency very easily and almost instantaneously. The
    trades of digital token could occur all over the world and at any time. Thus,
    the market of digitized asset is much wider than that of the physical asset. Digitization
    increases the number of potential buyers, thereby increasing the demand of the
    tokens. An increase in demand coupled with increased liquidity, is likely to increase
    the value of the underlying asset, creating wealth.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**1.** *Greater reach* – Through tokenization, the scope of the sale is widely
    enhanced. Investors and speculators, worldwide, can purchase the digitized token
    without a broker or a middle man. This increases the number of potential buyers
    of the token at the initial offering as well as in the secondary market.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**2.** *Increased ease of transaction* – With the transactions of tokens occurring
    on the internet, with records being maintained on a global platform, there is
    little need for middle-men or brokers. The transactions between the buyer and
    seller can occur at any time and not be subject to the convenience of the broker.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**3.** *Greater liquidity* – Increasing the number of potential buyer and making
    it easier to transact, increases the liquidity of the traded assets. In general,
    the asset is usually priced higher if they are liquid, and in contrast illiquid
    assets tend to be valued lower. In other words, there is an “illiquidity discount,”
    if the market of an asset is small, monopolized and the asset is difficult to
    sell. With increased liquidity through the application of technology, the value
    of the underlying asset is expected to increase.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4.** *Transparency of records* – With records being maintained on blockchain,
    the transparency of records and its availability is enhanced. This reduces information
    asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. The buyer knows the exact history
    of the token, the price and and terms of each previous transaction.'

    currently considered “illiquid” due to inherent inefficiencies of the markets.
    These markets would benefit with the increased transparency and frequency of transactions
    provided through tokenization. When properly executed, these markets could attract
    many small investors thereby increasing demand and the value of the underlying
    asset. In other words, by eliminating the “illiquidity discount,” the value of
    the underlying asset is expected to increase following tokenization.

    the web and the transactions are recorded on blockchain. An individual can invest
    in the tokens and thereby obtain the right to capitalize on the increase in value

    responsibilities of ownership. Of course, this also entails a loss of investment
    should the value of the asset decline, or become worthless.

    having graduated from college with a well-paying job, is saving to buy an apartment
    in Manhattan. A typical 1,000 square feet, two-bedroom apartment sells for say
    about $1M. The college graduate wants to make a modest investment of $10,000 toward
    the apartment, and gradually increase the investment, each quarter, by about $5,000\.
    The $10,000 will buy him only about 10 square feet to start with and he will increase
    his holding by an additional 4–5 square feet every quarter. Currently, there is
    no mechanism to make such investment possible. What the individual will have to
    do, is to save the $10,000 and subsequent funds in a bank account or mutual fund,
    until he has enough to make a down payment towards the apartment.[¹](#fn1) The
    problem with the traditional method is that the real estate prices are usually
    more volatile, and increase at a faster rate than the returns on traditional investments.
    Hence, our young professional is playing catch-up with the real estate market
    with his modest investments, and it may take him years before he can save enough
    for a down payment toward the apartment. However, through purchasing real estate
    tokens, he will be pegged into the Manhattan real estate prices, the value of
    his investment appreciating in tandem with the increase in real estate prices.
    This is tantamount to holding real estate mutual funds without the exorbitant
    management fees and being mostly limited to dispersed ownership of commercial
    buildings.

- en: The reversal of the situation is also entirely possible. Suppose you own an
    apartment with a current market value of $500,000, and you are in a desperate
    need of $5,000 in cash. Currently, you have no mechanism for selling 1% of the
    apartment for $5,000\. However, with tokenization, each property owner will be
    able to tokenize the property into small portions, or tokens, and can trade the
    tokens to others. In current situation, the owner has to rely on a bank providing
    him with a home equity loan of $5,000, which will bear an interest rate and would
    have to paid-off through regular monthly installments. With tokens, however, there
    is no implicit or explicit interest charges, and the principal amount does not
    have to be repaid. The owner of the apartment, selling the tokens, has the option
    but not the obligation to buy back the tokens at a later date at the fair market
    value at the time of buyback.

    the current owner and the prospective owner to monetize the value of real estate.
    This is accomplished by eliminating the middleman or the brokers involved in real
    estate transactions. The brokers tend to collect large commissions or transaction
    fees for merely providing a “trusted third party” service. However, when the technology
    acts as the “trusted third party” those fees and commissions are saved, yielding
    monetary benefit to both the owner and the investor.

    the token is akin to a company stock. The underlying asset may or may not generate
    cash or profits on a regular basis. Instead the value of the underlying asset,
    such as gold, painting or diamond, increases with time. Hence, the buyer of the
    token is speculating that the value of the underlying asset will increase over
    time, and so will the value of the token. Upon appreciation of the value of the
    underlying asset, the token could be sold or exchanged in the electronic medium
    without having to sell or transfer the underlying asset. Thus, the token holder
    can realize the gains without the underlying asset having to be sold or transferred.'

    the proceeds from the sale of token is used to finance a particular venture. Subsequently,
    the profits generated from that venture are shared with the token holders, the
    digital owners, upon the settlement of terms. See [Fig. 6.1](#fig1), for example,
    a farmer needs capital to buy fertilizer, seeds and rent agricultural equipment
    at the start of the farming season. Short of cash and unwilling to borrow from
    bank, the farmer sells digital tokens against the proceeds of the farm. Say, he
    needs $100,000 for the above and digitizes 1,000 tokens for $100 each toward 50%
    of the proceeds from the harvest. Once the crop has been harvested and sold say
    for $250,000, the holder of each token receives a sum of $125\. In the meantime,
    the original token holder could sell his token to another investor in the secondary
    market. Similar applications are being developed to finance movie production,
    as discussed in the next section.'

    Currently, most common people are unable to participate in that market. Tokenization
    of the painting would enable individuals all over the world to be able to purchase
    and own a portion of these paintings and benefit from the increase in the painting’s
    value. Consider for example the painting of water lilies by Monet that was auctioned
    at New York for $43 million in 2012\. Tokenization will transform the ownership
    of the painting into say million tokens. At the conclusions of the auction, each
    token will sell for $43\. An individual purchasing 100 tokens for $4,300 would
    own 0.01% of the painting. With time, as the value of the painting increases,
    so does the value of the token. The tokens can be traded between individuals without
    having to sell the painting. Obviously, the purchaser of the token does not possess
    any physical portion of the painting. However, the $43,000 goes to the owner of
    the painting and if the owner were to sell the painting, they have to settle,
    or buyback, all of the outstanding tokens. Normally, this kind of transaction
    would require immense trust and recordkeeping. However, blockchain technology
    eliminates the recordkeeping costs and reduces the risk of fraud. Since blockchain
    is a public ledger, which is immutable, the purchase of 100 tokens for $4,300
    is permanently recorded and no one can “alter” or erase it. The immutable recordkeeping
    enabled through blockchain provides the trust required for such transactions to

    legal provisions exist in physical setting, in that a business owner cannot physically
    sell the business without consent from his business partners. The legal framework

    how the value is transferred. For the blockchain application to be viable in the
    long term, all critical participants must benefit from the arrangement. Specifically,
    the participant who contributes economic value, that is, pays into the blockchain
    should consider this as the cost-effective option to the alternatives. The participants

    and reliance are exaggerated and misplaced. In this section, we discuss some of
    the continuing issues despite transition to blockchain technology for recordkeeping.
    Some of these weaknesses could potentially be exploited by miscreants and fraudsters
    to prey upon the unwitting and the trusting. We discuss two most significant risks,
    the risk of improper valuation of underlying assets or profits that may compromise
    the applicability and potential of tokenization and blockchain technology. Currently,
    seed funding for new ventures are usually provided by venture capitalists and
    angel investors as noted earlier. The professional investors have the resources
    and the expertise to engage in extensive due diligence procedures, which may be
    forgone in the new model of crowd sourcing, creating risks. Additionally, there
    are differences in regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, as tokenization transcends
    the geographic boundaries, it is imperative that regulators around the world coordinate
    their efforts and correspond regularly on threats to the system.

    and tokenization relate to ownership rights of the asset and not necessarily to
    the valuation of the underlying asset. This is an important distinction. What
    blockchain technology ensures is that the ownership at any point is indisputable,
    however the implied value of the token may not be reliable, depending upon the
    nature of the underlying asset. In situations when the underlying asset has a
    separate well-established market, such as for gold, silver and other precious
    metals and commodities, the value of the token can be precisely obtained. However,
    when the underlying asset itself is illiquid or is seldom traded, there will be
    a wide fluctuation in the value of the tokens. For example, the price in secondary
    markets of tokens representing priceless art are mostly speculative as precious
    art is not transacted as often. Moreover, since each piece is unique, it is difficult
    to precisely ascertain the market value of a classic painting. Since most of the
    sale of famous paintings occur at auctions, it is difficult to predict the transaction
    price or the market value of the painting, hence the derived value of the tokens.

    and a loss of investor trust. For example, when the asset is mispriced at the
    inception, that is, at the time when tokens are being issued, the early investors
    are paying more than the true value of the token, hence are unlikely to recover
    their investment in the long run. Similarly, if the asset is undervalued at the
    time of disposal, the token holders at the time of disposal are paid less than
    the true economic value of their tokens. In that sense, they are cheated out of
    the wealth that rightfully belongs to them.

    rightfully demand that the valuation be certified by professionals. This creates
    a new market for accountants and auditors. Accounting, as a discipline, specializes
    in measurement of economic value. As the need for this measurement grows both
    in terms of precision and frequency, it generates additional responsibilities
    and opportunities for the accounting profession. Hence, professional accountants
    ought to be well poised in the development of business opportunities that adoption
    of blockchain technology and the use of tokenization will generate.

    the underlying economics that govern the value of the token is non-trivial. Under
    the cash flow method, the determination of the final settlement value is based
    on the measure of operating profit of the venture. Again, while blockchain technology
    makes the records of ownership indisputable and transparent, it does not make
    the determination of operating profit any less ambiguous. Determination of operating
    profit has to conform to financial accounting policies and procedures and is subject
    to estimates and approximations prevalent in the current accounting methods and
    standards. Hence the accounting policies and estimates are clearly outlined at
    the inception of tokenization and adopted into smart contracts. In instances where
    underlying accounting policies are not explicitly and comprehensively specified,
    it provides the agent – the entity obtaining the funding, substantial leeway in
    reporting profits. This potentially could be a significant problem for crowd funding
    of movies and projects in industries that lack well-developed financial accounting
    standards.

    party. This is another new business need, created through tokenization, that accounting

    safeguards as well. Venture capitalists and angel investors usually have significant
    resources to undertake expensive due diligence procedures, and have the business

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mortgage securitization was a clever contraption that enabled banks to issue
    more mortgages and hence enabled more people to afford the purchase of houses.
    Mortgage securitization is the structured process whereby mortgage loans are combined
    and sold in the form of “asset-backed” securities. They are termed “asset-backed,”
    since these loans are collateralized by houses or real assets. This is how the
    process worked. The prospective homeowner visits the local bank to obtain a loan
    for a house. The bank performs initial due diligence and approves the loan. The
    borrower purchases the house and the bank pays most of the purchase price. While
    the homeowner promises to make future payment, there is always risk that the homeowner
    could default on the payment. The holder of the loan takes on this risk and is
    compensated through the interest income. However, in order to remove the risk
    from the books and make more capital available for additional loans, the originating
    bank then sells the rights to the future cash inflows to an investment bank for
    a flat fee. The investment bank collects many such contracts of monthly mortgage
    payments from all over and packages those as mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
    In essence, securitization is the process of taking illiquid assets and transforming
    them into a security. The method was so popular and mainstream, that two Hollywood
    movies *Inside Job* and *The Big Short* based their plot around this seemingly
    complicated financial contraption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mortgage securitization is beneficial for all parties involved. The homeowner
    is able to tap into relatively cheaper international credit market. The originator
    is able to access broader funding sources at more favorable rates, usually at
    debt ratings higher than their overall corporate ratings. Moreover, by removing
    the assets and corresponding debt they are able to improve their balance sheets.
    The investment bank collects hefty fees for amassing the mortgages from all over
    and packaging them into MBS through the wizardry of financial engineering. The
    end-purchases of the MBS benefits from having lucrative investment opportunities,
    tailor made to suit their risk preferences, while not having to perform operational
    tasks of collecting payments and servicing the loan. The ensuing market is extremely
    large, providing a significant amount of liquidity to a group of mortgages, each
    of which would individually be illiquid.

    is creation of “tranches,” that is risk-adjusted returns. The first tranche is
    the safest, takes precedence in terms of payment hence commands a lower interest
    rate. The second tranche is paid only after the upper tranche is fully satisfied,
    hence is slightly risky and commands a higher interest rate. The lowest tranche
    is the riskiest since it is paid only after full payment is made to the first
    two tranches. In general, the tranches could be structured in virtually any way,
    and under any rules the issuer deems appropriate. This allows investment banks
    to design products that can be tailored to a wide variation of risk profiles.

    the MBS method enables loan originators to pass on the risk of default of future

    until it was paid up, hence internalized the risk of default. However, through
    MBS the loan originator passes on the risk when they “sell” the loan to the investment
    bank. Likewise, the investment bank passes on the risk when it creates and sells
    MBS to investors. Thus, the loan originator is concerned about default only up
    to the point until it transfers the loan to the investment bank. This causes perverse
    incentives for the loan originator. Rather than establishing the long-term credit
    worthiness of the borrower to be able to fully satisfy the terms of the loan,
    the originator has more of a short-term focus and is concerned only if the loan
    would remain solvent for the next six months until the sale is finalized to the
    investment bank.

    Similarly, the credit rating agencies were not much concerned with individual
    loans but just the portfolio of the loans. Consequently, since no party was concerned

    these parties were focused on the long-term consequences. It was almost like a
    game of “hot potato.” Once the loan was passed on, it was the other parties’ problem.
    The system flourished as long as the borrower continued to make the loan payments.
    However, it came to a sudden halt as many of the homeowners started defaulting
    on their payments. The situation ballooned relatively rapidly, and was accelerated
    by a concurrent drop in real estate values in parts of United States. As the flow

    where the property was based and where the loan was owned, led to inadequate monitoring
    of the process. Traditional system of checks and balances were compromised since

    assets and deriving a product that is liquid and easily tradable. Tokenization
    of illiquid assets attempts to serve the same need. Tokenization of assets, such
    as paintings or real estate, attempts to convert sparsely traded, high value assets
    into fungible components that can be traded with ease. Reverting back to the earlier
    example of the Monet painting. While the painting itself will not be traded often,
    perhaps once every 20–25 years, the tokens based on the value of the painting
    would be traded more often. While the value of the tokens is derived from the
    value of the painting, it is not essential to sell the painting to realize the
    value. Similarly, in securitization of real estate, while the property was not
    being sold on a daily basis, the securitized debt instrument had an active market
    and could be traded with ease. In both instances, to realize the full potential
    and making these tradable, the underlying illiquid asset is converted into small
    tradable elements through either securitization or tokenization.

    assets, such as the tokenization in mineral supply chain, there are some growing
    applications of tokenization that have resemblance to securitization. Not surprisingly,
    these applications are also in the real estate market. Hence, it is important
    to consider those similarities and institute controls and preventive measures
    so as not to repeat the lesson of 2008 GFC. There are many similarities between
    securitization and tokenization. These are:'

    free. However, verification of ownership of MBS was not the factor that caused
    the 2008 GFC. Instead, it was the valuation of underlying assets and the cessation
    of associated cash flow in terms of mortgage payments. These issues still persist
    under the new technology. Rather the problem is exacerbated since transactions
    are sped up and the pool of potential investors further widened.

    grow, participation of various objective professional organizations is necessary.
    There has to be clear regulation and mechanisms to protect investors. There should
    be means to identify unscrupulous vendors and the ability to impose penalties.
    Without such safeguards, there potentially will be losses borne by common investors
    thereby impacting the trust in the system.

    and enforcement of international standards, involvement of reputational legitimate
    intermediaries, such as accounting firms and Wall Street banks. Tokenization has
    much potential to create wealth and facilitate diverse ownerships; however, care
    must be taken to ensure that proper controls and restrictions are built into the
    infrastructure to avoid failures and frauds. Adequate regulation and enforcement
    of those regulations would prevent fraudsters and unscrupulous businesses from
    taking advantage of a new business model to prey on unwitting and perhaps gullible
    investors.

- en: Tokenization is the aspect of blockchain technology with great potential and
    wide array of business applications. Tokenization primarily is a digital proof
    of ownership. It facilitates not only the recordkeeping and verification of ownership
    but also its speedy transfer from the seller to the buyer. Hence, it is easy to
    conceptualize many business applications where the friction of transfer of ownership
    causes an impediment to the volume of transaction. We provided three simple developing
    applications of tokenization in the areas of options trading, ownership of high-valued
    paintings and financing movie production.

    method and the cash flow method. In the equity method the value of the token varies
    with the changes in the value of underlying asset. In the cash flow method, the
    proceeds from the sale of tokens are used to finance a project. At the conclusion
    of the project, the proceeds or profits from the project are distributed to the
    token holders. In both these cases there are challenges of valuation and measurement
    that the accounting profession can help address.'

    reach, flexibility and transparency. Additionally, the technology enhances the
    ease with which transactions can be undertaken. While ease and convenience are
    of importance to technologist, it is important note that other attributes could
    be of greater importance in financial applications. For example, in financial
    applications the safety and reliability of service is of greater importance than
    the convenience of the service. For example, we do not keep our cash and other
    valuables in the bank because it is convenient, but because it is safe. As we
    evaluate the potential applications of this new technology it is important not
    to lose perspective on what attributes really matter for each application.

    of tokenization. The first use-case is a traditional application of obtaining
    seed funding for a new venture. Instead of pursuing traditional means to obtain
    funding, the company chose to tokenize their initial public offering. The second
    use-case is in the mining industry where compliance and recordkeeping for purchase
    of conflict minerals is quite arduous. The use-case suggests an innovative solution
    that exploits the key features of blockchain technology to provide a cost efficient
    but effective solution. The third application is tokenization of Japanese real
    estate market. This is an emerging area of application of tokenization with immense
    potential. However, given the recent history of 2008 GFC caused primarily through
    securitization of real estate assets, this application is also fraught with risks.
    The challenge remains on how to institute adequate controls and proper safeguards
    to benefit from increased liquidity while preserving the integrity of the market.
