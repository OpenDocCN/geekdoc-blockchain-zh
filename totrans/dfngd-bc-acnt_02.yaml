  zh: 6.1. 引言
- en: Tokenization, an integral component of blockchain technology, has emerged as
    the feature that is creating innovative applications of blockchain technology
    since 2018, and is progressing at a rapid pace. There apparently is a desire to
    “tokenize” almost all types of asset classes on blockchain, including real estate,
    painting, diamonds, stocks among many others. These asset classes are sometimes
    difficult to transfer or sub-divide, hence buyers and sellers exchange “paper”
    or legal deeds that represent the ownership in all or part of the asset. As with
    paper trail, the property deeds and titles are often difficult to transfer and
    to track. Commodity exchanges, in developed countries, have largely eliminated
    paper records and substituted those with electronic records. The electronic records
    still however rely on trusted parties and secure storage, increasing the overhead
    costs of operation. Hence, a solution is digitization and wide dispersion of records,
    or maintaining the record on blockchain.

  zh: 资产令牌化是区块链技术的一个核心组成部分，自2018年以来，它已经成为创造区块链技术创新应用的特征，并且正在快速发展。很明显，人们渴望在区块链上“代币化”几乎所有类型的资产类别，包括房地产、绘画、钻石、股票等等。这些资产类别有时难以转让或分割，因此买家和卖家交换“纸质”或法律文件，代表资产的全部或部分所有权。与纸质记录一样，财产转让证明和产权证明往往难以转让和追踪。在发达国家，商品交易所已经很大程度上消除了纸质记录，用电子记录取而代之。然而，这些电子记录仍然依赖于可信方和安全的存储，增加了运营的开支。因此，解决方案就是数字化和记录的广泛分散，或者在区块链上维护记录。
- en: Tokenizing assets is using digital representation to prove ownership of real
    assets. Even presently when one purchases a high value asset, like a house, a
    boat or a car, the buyer gets a paper-record of the purchase in addition to the
    physical possession of the asset. In the United States, we call it the “title”
    for the house or the car. Traditionally, the title is issued by a government entity
    after verification of the terms of sale and payment. They also verify that the
    seller was the rightful owner of the property and therefore had the “right to
    sell.” The government agency acts as a “trusted third party” in this transaction,
    collecting a recording fee and providing an assurance on the validity of the sale,
    and keeping record of rightful owners of the property. In a digitized world, digital
    tokens are used to prove ownership in real assets. These records are maintained
    online and can be accessed at any time and by anyone. Tokens can expedite and
    facilitate the process of buying and selling by eliminating the delay of having
    the records verified by government agencies. This feature opens up the tokenized
    asset to a wider market and previously untapped potential investor base.

  zh: 资产令牌化是使用数字表示来证明实体资产的所有权。即便是在现在，当一个人购买一个高价值资产，比如一栋房子、一艘船或一辆车时，购买者除了获得资产的物理占有外，还会得到一份购买记录的纸质文件。在美国，我们称这份文件为房子的“产权证明”或车的“产权证明”。传统上，这份产权证明是在政府实体核实销售条款和支付后发行的。他们还会核实卖方是财产的合法所有者，因此有“出售权”。在这个交易中，政府机构充当了一个“可信第三方”，收取记录费用，并提供销售有效性的保证，并记录财产的合法所有者。在一个数字化的世界里，数字代币被用来证明实体资产的所有权。这些记录是在线维护的，可以随时由任何人访问。代币可以通过消除需要政府机构验证记录的延迟，加速和简化购买和销售过程。这一特性使代币化的资产面向更广泛的市场，并接触到之前未开发的潜在投资者基础。
- en: One of the earliest successful applications of tokenization has been in the
    domain of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO). With the increased interest in utility
    tokens and security tokens, it is a natural progression to tokenize other asset
    classes. Digital tokens can be used to prove ownership in physical assets. Digital
    tokens can either be created through ICO or Security Token Offering (STO). The
    tokens represent a share in the underlying asset and are initially sold by the
    owner of the asset. Once issued, the security tokens can trade in secondary markets.
    The holder of the token can hold on to the token until the underlying asset is
    disposed of and the resolution reached, or they could trade the tokens in secondary
    markets which will adjust the price of the token to be commensurate with the value
    of the asset. As the value of the asset increases, so does the price of the token,
    and vice versa.

  zh: 代币化的最早成功应用之一是在初始代币发行（ICO）领域。随着对实用代币和安全代币兴趣的增加，自然演进到代币化其他资产类别。数字代币可以用来证明对物理资产的所有权。数字代币可以通过ICO或安全代币发行（STO）创建。这些代币代表
    underlying asset 的股份，并由资产所有者最初出售。一旦发行，安全代币可以在二级市场上交易。代币的持有者可以选择持有代币，直到 underlying
    asset 被处置并达成解决方案，或者他们可以在二级市场上交易代币，这将使代币的价格与资产的价值相匹配。随着资产价值的增加，代币的价格也随之增加，反之亦然。

    kinds. Next, we present illustrations of the concept and how tokenization is actually
    operationalized. We next discuss some of the emerging use-cases of tokenization.
    These use-cases are still in developmental stages. We then summarize the process
    of tokenization and the anticipated growth potential. We conclude the chapter
    with a discussion of the prevailing risks and comparing tokenization with securitization
    of assets. There are many similarities between the two approaches, hence the lessons
    learnt from the 2008 global financial crisis should be revisited in the context
    of tokenization.

    a week or month to settle, especially when parties to the transaction are spread

    it easier to transact, increases the liquidity of the traded assets. In general,
    the asset is usually priced higher if they are liquid, and in contrast illiquid
    assets tend to be valued lower. In other words, there is an “illiquidity discount,”
    if the market of an asset is small, monopolized and the asset is difficult to
    sell. With increased liquidity through the application of technology, the value
    of the underlying asset is expected to increase.'

    about $1M. The college graduate wants to make a modest investment of $10,000 toward
    the apartment, and gradually increase the investment, each quarter, by about $5,000\.
    The $10,000 will buy him only about 10 square feet to start with and he will increase
    his holding by an additional 4–5 square feet every quarter. Currently, there is
    no mechanism to make such investment possible. What the individual will have to
    do, is to save the $10,000 and subsequent funds in a bank account or mutual fund,
    until he has enough to make a down payment towards the apartment.[¹](#fn1) The
    problem with the traditional method is that the real estate prices are usually
    more volatile, and increase at a faster rate than the returns on traditional investments.
    Hence, our young professional is playing catch-up with the real estate market
    with his modest investments, and it may take him years before he can save enough
    for a down payment toward the apartment. However, through purchasing real estate
    tokens, he will be pegged into the Manhattan real estate prices, the value of
    his investment appreciating in tandem with the increase in real estate prices.
    This is tantamount to holding real estate mutual funds without the exorbitant
    management fees and being mostly limited to dispersed ownership of commercial

    传统方法的问题是，房地产价格通常更加波动，并且增长速度比传统投资的回报快。因此，我们的年轻专业人士用他的适度投资追赶房地产市场，可能需要多年才能为公寓存够首付。然而，通过购买房地产代币，他将紧密地与曼哈顿的房地产价格挂钩，他的投资价值随着房地产价格的上涨而增加。这相当于持有房地产共同基金，而不需要支付高昂的管理费用，并且主要限于商业建筑的分散所有权。

    apartment for $5,000\. However, with tokenization, each property owner will be
    able to tokenize the property into small portions, or tokens, and can trade the
    tokens to others. In current situation, the owner has to rely on a bank providing
    him with a home equity loan of $5,000, which will bear an interest rate and would
    have to paid-off through regular monthly installments. With tokens, however, there
    is no implicit or explicit interest charges, and the principal amount does not
    have to be repaid. The owner of the apartment, selling the tokens, has the option

    a farmer needs capital to buy fertilizer, seeds and rent agricultural equipment

    needs $100,000 for the above and digitizes 1,000 tokens for $100 each toward 50%
    of the proceeds from the harvest. Once the crop has been harvested and sold say
    for $250,000, the holder of each token receives a sum of $125\. In the meantime,

    Currently, most common people are unable to participate in that market. Tokenization
    of the painting would enable individuals all over the world to be able to purchase
    and own a portion of these paintings and benefit from the increase in the painting’s
    value. Consider for example the painting of water lilies by Monet that was auctioned
    at New York for $43 million in 2012\. Tokenization will transform the ownership
    of the painting into say million tokens. At the conclusions of the auction, each
    token will sell for $43\. An individual purchasing 100 tokens for $4,300 would
    own 0.01% of the painting. With time, as the value of the painting increases,
    so does the value of the token. The tokens can be traded between individuals without
    having to sell the painting. Obviously, the purchaser of the token does not possess
    any physical portion of the painting. However, the $43,000 goes to the owner of
    the painting and if the owner were to sell the painting, they have to settle,
    or buyback, all of the outstanding tokens. Normally, this kind of transaction
    would require immense trust and recordkeeping. However, blockchain technology
    eliminates the recordkeeping costs and reduces the risk of fraud. Since blockchain
    is a public ledger, which is immutable, the purchase of 100 tokens for $4,300
    is permanently recorded and no one can “alter” or erase it. The immutable recordkeeping
    enabled through blockchain provides the trust required for such transactions to
    occur.

  zh: 著名的画作通常通过拍卖以数百万美元的价格售出。目前，大多数普通人无法参与这个市场。画作Token化将使全世界的个人能够购买并拥有这些画作的一部分，并从画作价值的增加中受益。例如，2012年纽约拍卖的莫奈的《睡莲》画作，成交价为4300万美元。Token化将把画作的所有权转化为比如说一百万个代币。拍卖结束后，每个代币的售价为43美元。个人花费4300美元购买100个代币，就拥有了画作0.01%的所有权。随着时间的推移，随着画作价值的增加，代币的价值也会增加。代币可以在个人之间交易，而不必出售画作。显然，购买代币的人并不拥有画作的任何物理部分。然而，43000美元会归画作的所有者所有，如果画作的所有者要出售画作，他们必须结算，或回购，所有未偿还的代币。通常，这种交易需要极大的信任和记录保存。然而，区块链技术消除了记录保存的成本，减少了欺诈的风险。由于区块链是一个公开的账本，是不可变的，4300美元购买100个代币的交易是永久记录的，没有人可以“更改”或删除它。通过区块链实现的不可变记录保存为这种交易的发生提供了所需的信任。

- en: What sometimes is not realized is that transparency and “trust” in blockchain
    and tokenization relate to ownership rights of the asset and not necessarily to
    the valuation of the underlying asset. This is an important distinction. What
    blockchain technology ensures is that the ownership at any point is indisputable,
    however the implied value of the token may not be reliable, depending upon the
    nature of the underlying asset. In situations when the underlying asset has a
    separate well-established market, such as for gold, silver and other precious
    metals and commodities, the value of the token can be precisely obtained. However,
    when the underlying asset itself is illiquid or is seldom traded, there will be
    a wide fluctuation in the value of the tokens. For example, the price in secondary
    markets of tokens representing priceless art are mostly speculative as precious
    art is not transacted as often. Moreover, since each piece is unique, it is difficult
    to precisely ascertain the market value of a classic painting. Since most of the
    sale of famous paintings occur at auctions, it is difficult to predict the transaction
    price or the market value of the painting, hence the derived value of the tokens.

  zh: 有时人们可能没有意识到，区块链和代币化的透明度与“信任”与资产的所有权权益相关，而与基础资产的估值并无必然联系。这是一个重要的区别。区块链技术确保的是，在任何时间点资产的所有权都是无可争议的，然而代币的隐含价值可能并不可靠，这取决于基础资产的性质。当基础资产有一个单独的、成熟的市场时，例如黄金、白银和其他贵金属和商品，代币的价值可以精确获得。然而，当基础资产本身不流动或很少交易时，代币的价值将会有很大的波动。例如，代表无价艺术品的代币在二级市场的价格大多是出于投机，因为珍贵的艺术品并不经常交易。此外，由于每件艺术品都是独一无二的，很难精确确定经典画作的市值。由于大多数著名画作的销售发生在拍卖会上，很难预测画作的交易价格或市值，因此代币的派生价值也难以预测。
- en: Mispricing of the underlying asset can lead to inefficiencies in the system
    and a loss of investor trust. For example, when the asset is mispriced at the
    inception, that is, at the time when tokens are being issued, the early investors
    are paying more than the true value of the token, hence are unlikely to recover
    their investment in the long run. Similarly, if the asset is undervalued at the
    time of disposal, the token holders at the time of disposal are paid less than
    the true economic value of their tokens. In that sense, they are cheated out of
    the wealth that rightfully belongs to them.

  zh: 基础资产的定价偏差可能导致系统低效和投资者信任丧失。例如，当资产在创立时定价偏差，即代币发行时，早期投资者支付的代币价值超过其真实价值，因此长期内不太可能收回他们的投资。同样，如果资产在处置时被低估，处置时的代币持有者收到的代币价值低于其真实经济价值。从这个意义上说，他们被剥夺了本应属于他们的财富。
- en: Since a rational market participant expects this kind of mispricing both at
    the time of inception, at the time of disposal or any time in between, they would
    rightfully demand that the valuation be certified by professionals. This creates
    a new market for accountants and auditors. Accounting, as a discipline, specializes
    in measurement of economic value. As the need for this measurement grows both
    in terms of precision and frequency, it generates additional responsibilities
    and opportunities for the accounting profession. Hence, professional accountants

- en: Likewise, for the cash flow method of tokenization, the problem of determining
    the underlying economics that govern the value of the token is non-trivial. Under
    the cash flow method, the determination of the final settlement value is based
    on the measure of operating profit of the venture. Again, while blockchain technology
    makes the records of ownership indisputable and transparent, it does not make
    the determination of operating profit any less ambiguous. Determination of operating
    profit has to conform to financial accounting policies and procedures and is subject
    to estimates and approximations prevalent in the current accounting methods and
    standards. Hence the accounting policies and estimates are clearly outlined at
    the inception of tokenization and adopted into smart contracts. In instances where
    underlying accounting policies are not explicitly and comprehensively specified,
    it provides the agent – the entity obtaining the funding, substantial leeway in
    reporting profits. This potentially could be a significant problem for crowd funding

    process worked. The prospective homeowner visits the local bank to obtain a loan
    for a house. The bank performs initial due diligence and approves the loan. The
    borrower purchases the house and the bank pays most of the purchase price. While
    the homeowner promises to make future payment, there is always risk that the homeowner
    could default on the payment. The holder of the loan takes on this risk and is
    compensated through the interest income. However, in order to remove the risk
    from the books and make more capital available for additional loans, the originating
    bank then sells the rights to the future cash inflows to an investment bank for
    a flat fee. The investment bank collects many such contracts of monthly mortgage
    payments from all over and packages those as mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
    In essence, securitization is the process of taking illiquid assets and transforming
    them into a security. The method was so popular and mainstream, that two Hollywood
    movies *Inside Job* and *The Big Short* based their plot around this seemingly
    complicated financial contraption.

  zh: 抵押贷款证券化是一个巧妙的装置，它使银行能够发放更多的抵押贷款，从而使更多的人能够负担得起购房。抵押贷款证券化是一个结构化的过程，通过这个过程，抵押贷款被组合并以“资产支持”证券的形式出售。它们被称为“资产支持”，因为这些贷款是以房屋或实物资产为抵押的。这个过程是这样运作的。潜在的房主访问当地银行获取购房贷款。银行进行初步尽职调查并批准贷款。借款人购买房子，银行支付大部分购买价格。尽管房主承诺将来还款，但总是存在房主可能违约的风险。贷款持有者承担这种风险，并通过利息收入得到补偿。然而，为了将风险从账本中移除并使更多资金可用于发放额外贷款，发起银行随后以固定费用将未来现金流入的权利出售给投资银行。投资银行从各地收集许多按月支付抵押贷款的合同，并将这些合同作为抵押支持证券（MBS）进行包装。本质上，证券化是将流动性差的资产转化为证券的过程。这种方法非常流行和主流，以至于两部好莱坞电影《Inside
    Job》和《The Big Short》以这个看似复杂的金融装置为基础来构建它们的剧情。
- en: Mortgage securitization is beneficial for all parties involved. The homeowner
    is able to tap into relatively cheaper international credit market. The originator
    is able to access broader funding sources at more favorable rates, usually at
    debt ratings higher than their overall corporate ratings. Moreover, by removing
    the assets and corresponding debt they are able to improve their balance sheets.
    The investment bank collects hefty fees for amassing the mortgages from all over
    and packaging them into MBS through the wizardry of financial engineering. The
    end-purchases of the MBS benefits from having lucrative investment opportunities,
    tailor made to suit their risk preferences, while not having to perform operational
    tasks of collecting payments and servicing the loan. The ensuing market is extremely
    large, providing a significant amount of liquidity to a group of mortgages, each
    of which would individually be illiquid.

    is creation of “tranches,” that is risk-adjusted returns. The first tranche is
    the safest, takes precedence in terms of payment hence commands a lower interest
    rate. The second tranche is paid only after the upper tranche is fully satisfied,
    hence is slightly risky and commands a higher interest rate. The lowest tranche
    is the riskiest since it is paid only after full payment is made to the first
    two tranches. In general, the tranches could be structured in virtually any way,
    and under any rules the issuer deems appropriate. This allows investment banks
    to design products that can be tailored to a wide variation of risk profiles.

- en: Unlike in the traditional method for loan originators to give out mortgages,
    the MBS method enables loan originators to pass on the risk of default of future
    payments. In the traditional method, the loan originator held on to the mortgage
    until it was paid up, hence internalized the risk of default. However, through
    MBS the loan originator passes on the risk when they “sell” the loan to the investment
    bank. Likewise, the investment bank passes on the risk when it creates and sells
    MBS to investors. Thus, the loan originator is concerned about default only up
    to the point until it transfers the loan to the investment bank. This causes perverse
    incentives for the loan originator. Rather than establishing the long-term credit
    worthiness of the borrower to be able to fully satisfy the terms of the loan,
    the originator has more of a short-term focus and is concerned only if the loan
    would remain solvent for the next six months until the sale is finalized to the
    investment bank.

  zh: 与贷款发起人发放按揭的传统方式不同，MBS方法使贷款发起人能够转嫁未来违约风险。在传统方式中，贷款发起人会持有按揭直到其还清，因此会内部化违约风险。然而，通过MBS，当贷款发起人将贷款“出售”给投资银行时，贷款发起人转嫁了风险。同理，当投资银行创建并出售MBS给投资者时，投资银行也将风险转嫁。因此，贷款发起人对违约的关心只限于将其贷款转交给投资银行的那一刻。这给贷款发起人带来了扭曲的激励。与其建立借款人的长期信用状况以完全满足贷款条款，贷款发起人更注重短期，只关心贷款在未来六个月内能否保持健全，直到贷款最终出售给投资银行。
- en: The investment bank in turn was also less concerned about credit worthiness
    of individual loans, since it wasn’t holding on to the loan until its maturity.
    Instead it was combining it with other loans, securitizing it and selling onwards.
    Similarly, the credit rating agencies were not much concerned with individual
    loans but just the portfolio of the loans. Consequently, since no party was concerned
    about the borrower’s long-term ability or intent to make payments on the loan,
    individuals with spotty credit history and uncertain earning prospects were granted
    long-term mortgages.

- en: As each party in the chain was interested in generating the product and selling
    it to the next party, thereby collecting their fees and commission, they were
    all interested in generating large businesses through approving loans. None of
    these parties were focused on the long-term consequences. It was almost like a
    game of “hot potato.” Once the loan was passed on, it was the other parties’ problem.
    The system flourished as long as the borrower continued to make the loan payments.
    However, it came to a sudden halt as many of the homeowners started defaulting
    on their payments. The situation ballooned relatively rapidly, and was accelerated
    by a concurrent drop in real estate values in parts of United States. As the flow
    of money stopped, the holders of the loans were adversely affected leading to
    bankruptcies of major US financial institutions like Lehman Brothers, Washington
    Mutual, among others.

    concurrent drop 而加速。随着资金流的停止，贷款持有者受到了不利影响，导致了雷曼兄弟、华盛顿互助银行等主要美国金融机构的破产。

    for the 2008 GFC. With hindsight, it was evident that there should not have been
    a lowering of standards when granting loans. The large degree of separation between
    where the property was based and where the loan was owned, led to inadequate monitoring
    of the process. Traditional system of checks and balances were compromised since

    of illiquid assets attempts to serve the same need. Tokenization of assets, such
    as paintings or real estate, attempts to convert sparsely traded, high value assets
    into fungible components that can be traded with ease. Reverting back to the earlier
    example of the Monet painting. While the painting itself will not be traded often,
    perhaps once every 20–25 years, the tokens based on the value of the painting
    would be traded more often. While the value of the tokens is derived from the
    value of the painting, it is not essential to sell the painting to realize the
    value. Similarly, in securitization of real estate, while the property was not
    being sold on a daily basis, the securitized debt instrument had an active market
    and could be traded with ease. In both instances, to realize the full potential
    and making these tradable, the underlying illiquid asset is converted into small
    tradable elements through either securitization or tokenization.
