- en: Google’s security foibles, its “aggregate and advertise” model, its avoidance
    of price signals, its vertical silos of customer data, and its visions of machine
    mind are unlikely to survive the root-and-branch revolution of distributed peer-to-peer
    technology, which I call the “cryptocosm.”

- en: Today, all around us, scores of thousands of engineers and entrepreneurs are
    contriving a new system of the world that transcends the limits and illusions
    of the Google realm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the Google era, the prime rule of the Internet is “Communications first.”
    That means everything is free to be copied, moved, and mutated. While most of
    us welcome “free” on the understanding that it means “no charge,” what we really
    want is to get what we ordered rather than what the authority chooses to provide.
    In practice, “free” means insecure, amorphous, unmoored, and changeable from the
    top.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This communications-first principle served us well for many years. The Internet
    is a giant asynchronous replicator that communicates by copying. Regulating all
    property rights in the information economy are the copy-master kings, chiefly
    at Google.

- en: In this system, security is a function of the network, applied from the top,
    rather than a property of the device and its owner. So everything rises to the
    top, the Googleplex, which achieves its speed and efficiency by treating its users
    as if they were making random choices. That’s the essence of the mathematical
    model behind their search engine. You are a random function of Google.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you are not random; you are a unique genetic entity that cannot be factored
    back into an egg and a sperm. You are unbreakably encrypted by biology. These
    asymmetrical natural codes are the ruling model and metaphor for enduring security.
    You start by defining not the goal but the ground state. Before you build the
    function or the structure, you build the foundation. It is the ultimate non-random
    reality. The ground state is you.

- en: 'Utterly different from Google’s rule of communications first is the law of
    the cryptocosm. The first rule is the barn-door law: “Security first.” Security
    is not a procedure or a mechanism; it is an architecture. Its keys and doors,
    walls and channels, roofs and windows define property and privacy at the device-level.
    They determine who can go where and do what. Security cannot be retrofitted, patched,
    or improvised from above.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For you, security means not some average level of surveillance at the network
    level but the safety of your own identity, your own device, and your own property.
    You occupy and control a specific time and space. You cannot be blended or averaged.
    Just as you are part of a biological ledger, inscribed through time in DNA codes
    and irreversible by outside power, your properties and transactions compose an
    immutable ledger. Just as you are bound in time, every entry in the cryptocosmic
    ledger is timestamped.

- en: 'The second rule of the cryptocosm derives from the first: “Centralization is
    not safe.” Secure positions are decentralized ones, as human minds and DNA code
    are decentralized. Darwin’s mistake, and Google’s today, is to imagine that identity
    is a blend rather than a code—that machines can be a singularity, but human beings
    are random outcomes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Centralization tells thieves what digital assets are most valuable and where
    they are. It solves their most difficult problems. Unless power and information
    are distributed throughout the system peer to peer, they are vulnerable to manipulation
    and theft from the blenders at the top.

- en: 'The third rule is “Safety last.”[¹](notes.html#ch05note-1) Unless the architecture
    achieves its desired goals, safety and security are irrelevant. Security is a
    crucial asset of a functional system. Requiring the system to be safe at every
    step of construction results in a kludge: a machine too complex to use.'

- en: The fourth rule is “Nothing is free. This rule is fundamental to human dignity
    and worth. Capitalism requires companies to serve their customers and to accept
    their proof of work, which is money. Banishing money, companies devalue their
    customers.
  prefs: []

- en: 'The fifth rule is “Time is the final measure of cost.” Time is what remains
    scarce when all else becomes abundant: the speed of light and the span of life.
    The scarcity of time trumps an abundance of money.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The sixth rule: “Stable money endows humans with dignity and control.” Stable
    money reflects the scarcity of time. Without stable money, an economy is governed
    only by time and power.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The seventh rule is the “asymmetry law,” reproducing biological asymmetry. A
    message coded by a public key can be decrypted only by the private key, but the
    private key cannot be calculated from the public key. Asymmetric codes that are
    prohibitively difficult to break but easy to verify give power to the people.
    By contrast, symmetrical encryption gives power to the owners of the most costly
    computers.

    be blended or changed from on top any more than your DNA can be changed or blended
    from above.

- en: The ninth rule is “Private keys are held by individual human beings, not by
    governments or Google.” Private keys enforce property rights and identities. In
    a challenge-response interaction, the challenger takes the public key and encrypts
    a message. The private responder proves identity by decrypting, amending, and
    returning the message encrypted anew with his private key. This process is a digital
    signature. By decrypting the new message with a public key, the final recipient
    is assured that the sender is who he says he is. The document has been digitally
    signed.

- en: Ownership of private keys distributes power. The owner of a private key (ID)
    can always respond to a challenge by proving ownership of the identity of a public
    address and the contents of a public ledger. Thus, in response to government claims
    and charges, the owner of the private key can prove his work and his record. By
    signing with a private key, the owner can always prove title to an item of property
    defined by a public key on a digital ledger.

    interpreter.” A focus on individual human beings makes meaningful security.

- en: Google is hierarchical. Life after Google will be heterarchical. Google is top-down.
    Life after Google will be bottom-up. Google rules by the insecurity of all the
    lower layers in the stack. A porous stack enables the money and power to be sucked
    up to the top. In life after Google, a secure ground state in the individual human
    being, registered and timestamped in a digital ledger, will prevent this suction
    of hierarchical power.

    and most efficient availabilities of what you want and need. The proof of your

    imperatives of “free” will give way to the calibrated voluntary exchanges of free
    markets and micropayments.

    through blenders of conformity, the new world will subsist on the foundational
    realities of individual uniqueness and choice. Whereas the Google world is stifling
    entrepreneurs’ access to the public markets through initial public offerings,
    which are down 90 percent in two decades, the new world will offer an array of
    new paths to enterprise. From initial coin offerings and token issues to crowd-funded
    projects, new financial devices are already empowering a new generation of entrepreneurs.
    The queues of abject “unicorns”—privately held start-ups worth a billion dollars
    or more—outside the merger and acquisition offices of Google and its rivals will
    be dispersed, replaced by herds of “gazelles” headed for public markets at last.[²](notes.html#ch05note-2)

    Whereas money in the Google era is fodder for a five-trillion-dollar-a-day currency
    exchange—that’s seventy-five times the amount of the world’s trade in goods and
    services—you will command unmediated money that measures value rather than manipulates
    it. Whereas the Google world is layered with middlemen and trusted third parties,
    you will deal directly with others around the globe with scant fees or delays.
