    automationAnother aspect of the blockchain and cryptocurrency conversation, especially
    as it pertains to the financial services, that is important to have in a comprehensive
    way is the discussions around the internal controls necessary for further adoption.
    It is true that the conversation and analysis that normally surround internal
    controls may not be one that attracts large amounts of attention or excitement,
    but it is a critical one for the blockchain and artificial intelligence conversation
    (Crosman [2018](#CR2)). Put simply, even as technology becomes more integrated
    within the broader financial landscape and services professions, it will still
    remain important for financial services professionals to be aware of, and well
    versed in, developing and implementing internal controls (Fig. [11.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_11_Chapter/467992_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_11_Chapter/467992_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: The core of the idea around internal controls is that internal controls are
    the processes and procedures that help to both ensure that the information reported
    and communicated by the organization is accurate, and that organizational assets
    are safeguarded. Segregation of duties, custody of assets, ensuring a review of
    work products before they are finalized, and establishing an independent check
    on the data verification itself traditionally forms the foundation of controls.
    As computing technology has become more integrated within the financial services
    profession, a debate has sprung up around internal controls. Namely, as technology
    takes over ever increasing parts of the financial services analysis and reporting
    functions, the temptation is to delegate controls and processing of data to the
    computer programs themselves. As tempting as this methodology is, however, doing
    so opens the proverbial door for errors and omissions that can derail the organization.

    enable increases in efficiency and more streamlined processing of information,
    it does remove some of the human oversight critical to financial functions. Whether
    it takes the form of holding off on executing trades during periods of market
    volatility, making judgment calls with regards to the types of data included external
    reports, or ensuring that the work products and information produced are relevant
    for decision making, the presence of controls and segregated duties is imperative
    (Gao and Zhang [2019](#CR4)). Technology, and especially technology that helps
    enable the automation of increased streamlining of entries, may often be seen
    as a tool to improve the efficiency of operations, but can also act as a proverbial
    black box that limits the insights available to business decision makers. Instead
    of directly auditing audit evidence or other associated information, auditors
    and other financial professionals will instead be tasked with automating either
    around the computer or the broader business environment itself. Auditing around
    the technology tools employed during the organization is not a new implementation,
    but the sophistication of current tools and options can make this seem daunting.

    control focused individuals, but for all financial professionals, including those
    dealing with clients and customers in an investment or advisory capacity. Ensuring
    that clients and customer understand what they are investing in, be it cryptocurrencies,
    emerging technology companies, or other investment tools, is a clear responsibility
    of financial practitioners (Alexander [2019](#CR1)). In addition to assisting
    clients and customers with various investment decisions, individuals working in
    industry can help secure the data and information that drives the decision making
    process across industry lines. No matter how sophisticated the individual technology
    tools are, be it blockchain, robotic process automation, or comprehensive artificial
    intelligence solutions, the controls over the data inputs and outputs must be
    maintained. In fact, and taking into account the reality that the pace of information
    processing and decision making only continues to accelerate, the importance of
    maintaining information integrity is key.

- en: At first glance it may seem counterintuitive to assemble a section based on
    the additional services that are able to offered connected to the area of internal
    controls around both artificial intelligence and blockchain. It would seem that
    the broader implementation and adoption of more technology would render the need
    for robust or improved internal controls less important or eventually obsolete,
    but that ignores a few fundamental areas in which increased automation and data
    management will have a dramatic impact on data management and reporting (De Simone
    et al. [2015](#CR3)). Clearly every software tool is unique and will function
    differently at different organizations, but a few of the core questions and topics
    that should be considered when offering advisory or other services connected to
    AI, blockchain, or automation questions in general are as follows.

- en: First, which parties actually have control or access to the information core
    information itself as it is uploaded and entered into the system. In the world
    of the internet of things, this is not an idle or abstract question, as data and
    information are being delivered to the management team from virtually every possible
    source. While these different flows of information are not necessarily always
    financial in nature, they will invariably have an impact on the performance of
    the organization. Inventory information, operational data, feedback obtained from
    market participants, and other types of information will drive the performance
    of the organization both in the present and in the future (Yunhao et al. 2014).
    This is not anything new or innovative, but what may be new is the reality that
    financial services professionals will be more a part of this operationally based
    dialogue that might have previously been the case. In order for the management
    team to make best use of these different sources of data, it must be trusted information.
    From a financial advisory perspective, this means that the organization must be
    able to effectively assess and understand the cost and functionality of different
    options available in the marketplace. In addition to have an appropriate understanding
    of costs and functionality, the intersection between different sources of information
    and funding availability should always be a part of the dialogue.

    efforts in order, financial services professionals with a market making perspective
    should focus on the following matters (Lowe et al. [2018](#CR7)). If, for example,
    the organization has invested in various sustainability and environmental initiatives
    and projects, this may open the door to grants, funding, and other financial opportunities
    that might otherwise have remained inaccessible. Especially as the interest toward
    various sustainability and environmental efforts continues to increase, this is
    quickly becoming a fundamental business issue rather than just an idea to consider
    at a qualitative level. Market oriented professionals should, reflecting the increased
    financial interest and activity in this space – in the form of green bonds, ESG
    investment opportunities, and institutional capital wanting to become affiliated
    with organizations operating in a sustainable manner – generating a true opportunity
    for management professionals and associated employees.

    a blockchain platform, and while every individual blockchain can be programmed
    differently that is a generally accurate statement. Once a block of information
    has been entered on the blockchain, and been verified/approved by other network
    members, that individual block of information cannot be altered. This also introduces
    the following concept that, as financial professionals are seeking to develop
    and implement blockchain oriented service, that a good place to start may be with
    busting some common myths associated with blockchain technology.

    Blockchain is, without a doubt, a hot topic for everyone associated with the financial
    services businesses, but that does not mean that blockchain is an accounting system
    or platform. There are no journal entries that take place on a blockchain platform,
    there are no financial statements produced on a blockchain, and there are not
    equity trades executed on the blockchain itself. Blockchain is an excellent tool
    to store and communicate information in an encrypted manner, but and is of interest
    for virtually everyone in the financial services landscape, but it is not an accounting
    platform.

    blockchain itself (specifically the bitcoin blockchain) has, to date at least,
    been immune to hacking attempts, that does not mean that simply by implementing
    blockchain that all risks are eliminated. In order to implement, develop, and
    stress test a blockchain option the organization must use hardware, software,
    and employ certain technically skilled individuals to program and maintain this
    blockchain. Whenever that combination of factors is involved in a project itself,
    there is always an opportunity for fraud, unethical behavior, or simply errors
    to derail the blockchain process itself.

    Although both blockchain and artificial intelligence have received large amounts
    of investment and attention, including billions of dollars invested by financial
    institutions, that does not necessarily mean that these tools are always better
    than current options. As both blockchain and artificial intelligence transition
    through the adoption cycle, and move from the hype peak through the trough of
    disillusionment, the disconnect between practical realities and potential is becoming
    more apparent. Even with these periodic failures and pilot tests being shut down,
    it is still important for financial services professionals to be aware of just
    where blockchain is being implemented.

    has been made in the development of industry and segment standards this does not
    mean that blockchain is either cost effective or easy to use. For example, the
    average starting salary for blockchain engineers, developers, or programmers continues
    to increase from the low six-figures to near mid six-figures. On top of these
    rather obvious costs, there are also costs and considerations that need to be
    accounted for in terms of integrating blockchain platforms and options with current
    technology options.

    Although cryptocurrencies might represent the most well known application and
    development of blockchain, that does not mean that all blockchains must use cryptocurrencies.
    Even more to the point of importance for financial professionals, this means that
    even if clients and/or client organizations are interested in blockchain options
    that does not mean that cryptocurrencies must be part of the conversation. This
    is an important point, and although it might seem relatively basic, for clients
    to understand and to integrate into their decision making process.

- en: Automation is coming for the financial services profession, whether or not individual
    firms or practitioners are preparing for the transition. Automated trading strategies
    have long been a part of the financial marketplace, but the proliferation of automation
    strategies continues to spread with almost relentless speed (Masli et al. [2010](#CR8)).
    Even with all of the benefits and opportunities that increased automation provides,
    however, it is also worth pointing out that controls and policies specific to
    RPA controls should be put into place. Contrasted versus previous automation and
    automated programming developments, RPA appears to represent a next step application
    and iteration of different technology processes, including the requirement and
    expectation of improved controls and control procedures over the custody, analysis,
    and handling of information. Differences, of course, will exists between different
    organizations, and these points of consideration are not meant to be all inclusive
    not exhaustive. Rather, these points should be considered and analyzed as starting
    points to initiative and continue a dialogue around the controls necessary to
    facilitate a broader implementation of technology such as robotic process automation.

- en: First, and perhaps most importantly, conversations and analyses must be held
    between financial services organizations and client firms. Making internal improvements
    in terms of data analysis and operational improvements are important things –
    in and of themselves – but will never be fully realized without the buy in and
    support of the clients who will be impacted. A core point of RPA and other advanced
    automation technologies is that information must be shared and distributed more
    openly between counterparties. Whether or not this is acceptable or desired by
    different clients and client organizations is something that must be addressed
    first and foremost, and especially before the substantial financial investments
    necessary for technology upgrades are undertaken.

- en: Second, are the employees and individuals who are going to be tasked with implementing
    such controls procedures and processes able to do so? This might seem like a relatively
    fundamental question or item to address, but is something that is vitally important
    to the successful implementation of a robust automation protocol. Traditional
    control policies and procedures simply will not be able to updated and upgraded
    to an increasingly RPA based and driven environment. Put simply, controls, control
    implementation, and the testing of said controls over the handling and processing
    of information are going to have to evolve and change on an almost fundamental
    level in order to remain relevant moving forward (Kim et al. [2018](#CR6)). Internal
    controls may appear to be an accounting specific conversation, but certainly have
    implications across the financial services spectrum. For example, and building
    on current movements toward automated investing decisions, financial service professionals
    will need to be able to understand how increasingly automated trading and investment
    platforms operate in regards to both investment decision making and the impact
    such automated decisions have on the financial performance of certain investments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, and of importance in a business environment increasingly concerned with
    controls around data and data integrity, the importance of maintaining controls
    even as certain decisions are automated is critically important. In order to effectively
    do this, for example, in the case of incorrect information being added to the
    blockchain, this may result in this faulty information being disseminated on a
    continuous basis. Such rapid distribution of data and information may actually
    end up damaging the business in terms of both reputational damage and financial
    damages as well. Controls both over the input of data into the various automation
    systems and blockchain options are critically important, especially as these tools
    and platforms are proliferating into other industries (Keune and Keune [2018](#CR5)).
    For example, as healthcare blockchains become more prevalent, the security and
    integrity over the patient and other confidential information it will an ever
    larger issue for practitioners to be aware of and able to articulate.

- en: For all of the potential and excitement that surrounds blockchain, robotic process
    automation, artificial intelligence, and other automation tools and platforms
    it is also important to take into account the internal control considerations
    that must be a part of the financial services conversation. Especially from an
    accounting and finance perspective, establishing and maintaining effective internal
    controls is an imperative responsibility, and even could be considered a fiduciary
    duty, for any practitioner seeking to offer and develop services connected to
    these areas. Numerous incidents have rippled through the blockchain and cryptocurrency
    landscape since the technology became mainstream, which only reinforces the need
    and expectation for practitioners to develop appropriate internal controls. What
    this mean from a practical point of view is that this chapter drills down into
    some of the considerations that need to be factored into any professional dialogue
    that are affiliated with emerging technology tools. Internal controls are a well
    established part of the accounting and financial services conversation, and this
    chapter connects this well established topic with the topics of emerging importance
    that include, but are not limited to those mentioned within this text. Additionally,
    an area that is explored in this text are the opportunities to develop and implement
    potential new service lines and business use cases developed to the need for more
    robust internal controls as they connect to emerging technology.
