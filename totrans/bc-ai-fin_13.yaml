    automationAnother aspect of the blockchain and cryptocurrency conversation, especially
    as it pertains to the financial services, that is important to have in a comprehensive
    way is the discussions around the internal controls necessary for further adoption.
    It is true that the conversation and analysis that normally surround internal
    controls may not be one that attracts large amounts of attention or excitement,
    but it is a critical one for the blockchain and artificial intelligence conversation
    (Crosman [2018](#CR2)). Put simply, even as technology becomes more integrated
    within the broader financial landscape and services professions, it will still
    remain important for financial services professionals to be aware of, and well
    versed in, developing and implementing internal controls (Fig. [11.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_11_Chapter/467992_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_11_Chapter/467992_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: The core of the idea around internal controls is that internal controls are
    the processes and procedures that help to both ensure that the information reported
    and communicated by the organization is accurate, and that organizational assets
    are safeguarded. Segregation of duties, custody of assets, ensuring a review of
    work products before they are finalized, and establishing an independent check
    on the data verification itself traditionally forms the foundation of controls.
    As computing technology has become more integrated within the financial services
    profession, a debate has sprung up around internal controls. Namely, as technology
    takes over ever increasing parts of the financial services analysis and reporting
    functions, the temptation is to delegate controls and processing of data to the
    computer programs themselves. As tempting as this methodology is, however, doing
    so opens the proverbial door for errors and omissions that can derail the organization.

  zh: 关于内部控制的核心思想是，内部控制是帮助确保组织所报告和传达的信息准确，并且保护组织资产的过程和程序。职责分离、资产保管、确保在最终确定之前审查工作成果，以及建立对数据验证的独立检查传统上构成控制的基础。随着计算技术在金融服务行业的更加融入，围绕内部控制展开了一场辩论。换句话说，随着技术接管金融服务分析和报告功能的越来越多部分，诱惑就是将控制和数据处理委托给计算机程序本身。然而，尽管这种方法诱人，这样做却打开了可能导致组织出现错误和遗漏的大门。
- en: Even though the digitization and automation of information and processes does
    enable increases in efficiency and more streamlined processing of information,
    it does remove some of the human oversight critical to financial functions. Whether
    it takes the form of holding off on executing trades during periods of market
    volatility, making judgment calls with regards to the types of data included external
    reports, or ensuring that the work products and information produced are relevant
    for decision making, the presence of controls and segregated duties is imperative
    (Gao and Zhang [2019](#CR4)). Technology, and especially technology that helps
    enable the automation of increased streamlining of entries, may often be seen
    as a tool to improve the efficiency of operations, but can also act as a proverbial
    black box that limits the insights available to business decision makers. Instead
    of directly auditing audit evidence or other associated information, auditors
    and other financial professionals will instead be tasked with automating either
    around the computer or the broader business environment itself. Auditing around
    the technology tools employed during the organization is not a new implementation,
    but the sophistication of current tools and options can make this seem daunting.

    and Zhang [2019](#CR4)）。技术，尤其是有助于自动化增加流程的技术，往往被视为提高运营效率的工具，但也可能成为限制企业决策者可用见解的黑匣子。审计人员和其他财务专业人员不会直接审计审计证据或其他相关信息，而是被要求自动化处理计算机或更广泛的业务环境。审计组织中所使用的技术工具并不是一个新的实施，但当前工具和选项的复杂性可能会使这看上去令人生畏。

    emerging technology companies, or other investment tools, is a clear responsibility
    of financial practitioners (Alexander [2019](#CR1)). In addition to assisting
    clients and customers with various investment decisions, individuals working in
    industry can help secure the data and information that drives the decision making
    process across industry lines. No matter how sophisticated the individual technology
    tools are, be it blockchain, robotic process automation, or comprehensive artificial
    intelligence solutions, the controls over the data inputs and outputs must be

    the broader implementation and adoption of more technology would render the need

    management will have a dramatic impact on data management and reporting (De Simone

    Simone等，2015）。显然，每个软件工具都是独特的，并且在不同的组织中的功能也不同，但在提供与AI、区块链或自动化问题相关的咨询或其他服务时，应考虑的一些核心问题和话题如下。
- en: First, which parties actually have control or access to the information core
    information itself as it is uploaded and entered into the system. In the world
    of the internet of things, this is not an idle or abstract question, as data and
    information are being delivered to the management team from virtually every possible
    source. While these different flows of information are not necessarily always
    financial in nature, they will invariably have an impact on the performance of
    the organization. Inventory information, operational data, feedback obtained from
    market participants, and other types of information will drive the performance
    of the organization both in the present and in the future (Yunhao et al. 2014).
    This is not anything new or innovative, but what may be new is the reality that
    financial services professionals will be more a part of this operationally based
    dialogue that might have previously been the case. In order for the management
    team to make best use of these different sources of data, it must be trusted information.
    From a financial advisory perspective, this means that the organization must be
    able to effectively assess and understand the cost and functionality of different
    options available in the marketplace. In addition to have an appropriate understanding
    of costs and functionality, the intersection between different sources of information
    and funding availability should always be a part of the dialogue.

    strategies continues to spread with almost relentless speed (Masli et al. [2010](#CR8)).
    Even with all of the benefits and opportunities that increased automation provides,

    and iteration of different technology processes, including the requirement and
    expectation of improved controls and control procedures over the custody, analysis,
    and handling of information. Differences, of course, will exists between different
    organizations, and these points of consideration are not meant to be all inclusive

    implementation, and the testing of said controls over the handling and processing
    of information are going to have to evolve and change on an almost fundamental
    level in order to remain relevant moving forward (Kim et al. [2018](#CR6)). Internal
    controls may appear to be an accounting specific conversation, but certainly have
    implications across the financial services spectrum. For example, and building
    on current movements toward automated investing decisions, financial service professionals

- en: For all of the potential and excitement that surrounds blockchain, robotic process
    automation, artificial intelligence, and other automation tools and platforms
    it is also important to take into account the internal control considerations
    that must be a part of the financial services conversation. Especially from an
    accounting and finance perspective, establishing and maintaining effective internal
    controls is an imperative responsibility, and even could be considered a fiduciary
    duty, for any practitioner seeking to offer and develop services connected to
    these areas. Numerous incidents have rippled through the blockchain and cryptocurrency
    landscape since the technology became mainstream, which only reinforces the need
    and expectation for practitioners to develop appropriate internal controls. What
    this mean from a practical point of view is that this chapter drills down into
    some of the considerations that need to be factored into any professional dialogue
    that are affiliated with emerging technology tools. Internal controls are a well
    established part of the accounting and financial services conversation, and this
    chapter connects this well established topic with the topics of emerging importance
    that include, but are not limited to those mentioned within this text. Additionally,
    an area that is explored in this text are the opportunities to develop and implement
    potential new service lines and business use cases developed to the need for more
    robust internal controls as they connect to emerging technology.

  zh: 尽管区块链、机器人流程自动化、人工智能和其他自动化工具和平台所带来的潜力和兴奋都都很重要，但必须考虑这些技术的内部控制意义。特别是从会计和金融的角度来看，建立和维护有效的内部控制是一项重要的责任，甚至对于寻求提供和开发这些领域服务的从业者来说，可以被视为一种受托责任。自从这项技术成为主流以来，许多事件已经在区块链和加密货币领域产生了连锁反应，这进一步强调了从业者需开发适当的内部控制的必要性和期望。从实际的角度来看，本章重点考虑了需要纳入任何与新兴技术工具相关的专业对话中的一些考虑因素。内部控制已经是会计和金融服务对话的一个结构完善的部分，并且本章将这个日益重要的话题与包括但不限于本文提到的话题相连接。此外，本文探讨了在这一领域的机会，以开发和实施潜在的新服务范围和业务用例，这些需求引起的更强大的内部控制作为与新兴技术相联系的。
