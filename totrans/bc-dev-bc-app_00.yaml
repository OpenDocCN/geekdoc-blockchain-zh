- en: 'IntroductionWhen human beings lead a more nomadic life, there was no concept
    of ownership. There was no need to own anything because everything they needed
    to survive they either gathered or produced for themselves. And because of the
    nomadic nature of their lifestyle there was no need to own land or livestock.
    They moved around and lived off the land.As time went on, they started to settle
    and grow their own crops. Once they started doing this there became a need to
    own the land that their crops grew on. There also was a need to own the apparatus
    they used to tend to these crops. Thus the concept of ownership was born.As they
    continued to farm and produce fruits and vegetables, they would end up with more
    produce than they actually needed. They began to barter with each other. If one
    had more tomatoes than they needed and wanted spinach, they could exchange some
    of their tomatoes for some of someone else’s spinach.Eventually, they felt the
    need to record these transactions so they started writing to keep track of ownership.
    We can look at these writings as the first ledgers.While they were moving in the
    right direction, they had a problem with trust. There was no way for them to verify
    the information contained in the ledgers because not everybody had access to them.When
    banks eventually came around, people also had to trust them to keep their money
    safe, and that didn’t always end well. There have been seven financial crises
    from the Great Depression to the Great Recession.Some people started to realize
    that we needed a way forward that didn’t see us relying heavily on other people.
    They saw that we needed a way to transact without fear or the constant threat
    of human error. Thus, Blockchain was born.The overarching theme with Blockchain
    and Cryptocurrency is that you don’t have to put your trust in an individual or
    a central authority to keep your assets safe. You don’t even have to worry about
    breaches of contract or the integrity of any other party. Blockchain has the potential
    to ensure that most, if not all industries run more efficiently.Blockchain DevelopmentBlockchain
    Development is a novel career path. Because of this there are many opportunities
    you can take advantage of. A blockchain developer builds Decentralized Applications
    or DApps for short. DApps are programs that operate on a peer-to-peer network
    of computers as opposed to a single computer.On a daily basis, a developer uses
    different programming languages to execute the code that designs user-interfaces,
    features and structures for blockchain applications. They are also responsible
    for putting security measures in place to avoid any attempts at hacking.There
    are many self taught programmers and developers operating in the tech world today.
    It is possible to become a blockchain developer without a degree, but you would
    have to work extremely hard and possess the right skill set. If you plan on going
    about becoming a developer the traditional way, you will need:● At the very least,
    a Bachelor’s degree in computer science or IT.● Analytical expertise. A key part
    of development is working out what the customer needs and finding ways to achieve
    the best results with whatever infrastructure they have.● Coding skills. A thorough
    knowledge of various coding languages would be advantageous because it takes more
    than one to build a blockchain network.● Foundational knowledge of blockchain
    protocols. A protocol is an array of practices for sharing data from device to
    device. The only way devices can share information is if there is an aforementioned
    agreement stating how to structure it and how it will be sent and received. If
    there was no protocol, computer A could be sending data in 32-bit increments while
    computer B is expecting to receive data in 64-bit increments. The most prominent
    set of protocols is OSI or Open Systems Interconnection. It is a set of instructions
    on how all network interactions should be carried out between computers. Internet
    protocols you may recognize are: IP, HTTPS, and DNS.Not every blockchain developer
    is going to have the same job specs because there are different positions one
    can hold, namely:Blockchain Solution ArchitectSolution Architects are responsible
    for everything technical during the sales process. They work closely with the
    sales head in devising solutions. They then lead a team of developers and eventually
    provide the solution to the customers.Blockchain Quality EngineerQuality Engineers
    supervise the development of blockchain applications and ensure that they are
    up to standard. Quality engineers are required to keep abreast of the newest blockchain
    features and developments.Blockchain Project ManagerProject managers are more
    like overseers. They monitor and evaluate resources, supervise security protocols
    and transaction administration systems, compose distinct features and manage any
    operational issues on a blockchain network.Blockchain ApplicationsWhen people
    think of the Blockchain, they almost immediately think of cryptocurrency, but
    it has other capabilities that could potentially involve Fiat money. Fiat money
    is tangible money. Fiat is Latin for ‘let it be done’. Money only has value because
    the government says so but it isn’t backed by anything.Applications include:●     Money
    transfersBy cutting out the middleman, transferring money from person to person
    works out cheaper and is much quicker. It’s convenient when transferring money
    across countries. Somebody in the United States can send money to the Dominican
    Republic in minutes.●     Financial exchangesThe bulk of cryptocurrency exchanges
    on the blockchain used to happen from person to person. Now, different organizations
    are starting to offer decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. These organizations
    have more control and can feel safe knowing that their transactions are secure.●     LendingSmart
    contracts can be used by lenders to administer guaranteed loans. Processing these
    loans is faster and less expensive because Smart contracts have features that
    automatically set off service payments and release of funds. This also means that
    they can offer better interest rates.●     InsuranceInsurance has always been
    murky. Customers have never really been sure of what the fine print says and have
    found themselves in precarious positions because of this. Smart contracts allow
    for transparency between insurance providers and customers. No customer would
    be able to claim twice for the same incident and they could actually receive payouts
    faster.●     Real estateReal estate involves a considerable amount of paperwork.
    Personal information needs verification and transfer documents need to be checked
    thoroughly before a sale goes through. Blockchain technology can minimize paperwork
    while still offering security and ensuring quicker transactions.●     Storing
    personal informationIt is possible for any entity storing personal information
    online to experience a breach in security. Storing this information on a public
    ledger offers more security because it’s harder to penetrate the blockchain system.●     Storing
    dataThe issuing of state benefits would substantially improve if identification
    information was stored on a blockchain.●     VotingIf identity information was
    stored on a blockchain, people would be able to cast their votes more easily.
    Nobody would be able to vote twice and votes wouldn’t be interfered with. It would
    also encourage more people to vote by being more convenient.●     State benefitsStoring
    identification information on a blockchain could aid in the dispersion of government
    benefits like Medicare. Blockchain’s infrastructure would reduce fraud and operation
    costs. People would also receive their benefits a lot faster.●     Storing and
    sharing medical informationStoring medical records on a blockchain could assist
    in patients receiving the best medical care. Doctors would receive the latest
    and most accurate information on their patients thus avoiding misdiagnosis and
    wrongful treatment.●     RoyaltiesIf there were up-to-date records on all film
    and music files spread over the internet, there would be a lot less piracy and
    artists’ royalties would be paid in full and on time.●     NFTsNon-fungible tokens
    are a way for people to own the rights to anything that can be stored as data
    online, but it’s most prevalent in digital art. Putting NFTs on a blockchain can
    make certain that only a singular piece of digital art exists. It makes investing
    in art easier for people because there’s no need to worry about storage and preservation.●     Supply
    chain and logistics trackingKeeping track of articles as they traverse a supply
    chain network can help supply chain and logistics departments work better together.
    If all the data is stored on a blockchain network then it can’t be modified and
    it can be accessed easily by the relevant parties.●     Securing Internet of Things
    networksThe Internet of Things or IoT, is a system of interlinked computers that
    have UIDs or Unique Identifiers that allow them to transmit data over a network.
    It works without human interaction. It’s convenient, but susceptible to digital
    crime. It makes use of a centralized server, which makes it easier for hackers
    to access. The blockchain interface can enhance security by keeping login credentials
    on a decentralized network.●     GamblingThe blockchain network could potentially
    be very beneficial, especially for gamblers. If a casino were to conduct its business
    on a blockchain there would be a lot more transparency. All dealings would be
    recorded on the blockchain which means that patrons would always be sure that
    their games were fair and that they would be paid out what they are owed. Use
    of a blockchain would also mean that personal information wouldn’t need to be
    shared and players could gamble anonymously.'
