- en: Blockchain is called a ledger technology that is distributed evenly across the
    network (Angeletti et al., [2017](#CR2)). Most of the transactions can be stored
    digitally. The whole assets are stored as notes in different networks, and the
    network is shared among various parts. Conventionally all the data will be stored
    on a server. This can be avoided by having all the data in the cloud. So the need
    for the ledger is not needed, and hence it can be stored and accessed at any part
    of the time and anywhere in the world. But the problem is that the data is not
    secure when it is shared among the various networks (Anastasia Theodouli et al.,
    [2018](#CR1)). The data is shared among various trustless parties, and they may
    provide a lot of problems in the real-time environment. Each data will be processed
    separately and combined as a block, and the same block will be transferred to
    various other nodes. The same thing may happen in the network. Through a proper
    validation, the nodes can transfer the blocks till it reaches the blockchain.

    factors. Here scaling plays a vital role. Today scaling in technology means how
    the data can be stored securely and also how to manage the data. Security threat
    is the biggest problem in storing the data (Mamoshina et al., [2018](#CR28)).
    The whole system is to be maintained such that the data must not be getting leaked
    in any situation. Hence, blockchain is used to segregate the data and for managing
    it as a ledger. It holds the data in the ledger, and all the blocks are connected
    as nodes. Once the consensus is reached, the data can be accessed after proper
    authentication. Here cryptography is used for achieving the consensus. The blockchain
    architecture involves cost as well as complexity to minimize the noise generated
    during transactions (Balaji et al., [2018](#CR3)). The blockchain architecture
    supports various areas like inventory, supply chain, and banking sector.

    sector is in dire need of this technology, and now it is expanding its growth
    at a wider level. The primary concern here is to go with database management as
    well as privacy. Recent analysis shows that the revenue generated for the blockchain
    is around $20 K, and it is expected to grow further. The growth of the healthcare
    unit highly depends on the usage of modern equipment and security level. Recent
    studies show that the healthcare unit does not follow the protocols on data privacy.
    Hence the third-party agents are accessing the medical records to improve their
    profit by making the people do the insurance policy. It leads to the growth of
    blockchain technology and an increase in the market rate. It is predicted that
    in 2025 the growth rate will be in the range of 40–50% of present revenue. The
    survey is done by Grand View Research, USA. Figure [9.1](#Fig1) shows the revenue
    involved in the blockchain.![../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.png)

    to provide a solution to these problems. So it uses cryptography technology, as
    well as a digital signature, to ensure that the data does not get lost with the
    third party. So this has to be taken care of by giving access to the third party.
    This is to be modified such that each party has to have certain access right such
    that the network does not get affected. If we compare the blockchain with the
    conventional database, it is storing data but supported by software that validates
    the data and third party. Every time new data is to be uploaded, it is to be verified,
    and then it is shared in the block (Liang et al., [2018a](#CR26), [2018b](#CR27)).
    It shows the need for authenticated software for sharing the data in the network
    (Li et al., [2018](#CR25)).

    In the book, we will have text content arranged in paragraphs and will have page
    numbers (Laskowski et al., [2017](#CR23)). The same way content of blocks is stored
    with the help of an address. It is also similar to saving data in tables or Excel
    sheets (Bell et al., [2014](#CR9)). So in this method similar to a book, each
    block will have data along with a header that contains the details about the block
    and extra contents that ensure security structure and digital signature. It is
    similar to a book. In a book, contents can be accessed with the help of page numbers,
    whereas in the blockchain, it can be accessed with the help of nodes. Scrambled
    books can be rearranged the same way it can be done in the case of blockchain.

    so much data, and this data has to be safely stored somewhere. This is where blockchain
    plays a major role. The blockchain systems work in a phased manner. Initially,
    it contains a database with the available data. The new data to be stored is taken
    as a new asset, and it will be stored in the blockchain after authentication.
    For authentication, many mathematical calculations have to be done so that the
    data is secure (Kuo, [2017](#CR22)).

    a vital role here in storing the data with security. Here each block is maintained
    as an encrypted block and hence cannot be accessed more simply. Each transaction
    is to be monitored, and hence each transaction is to be authenticated before doing
    the transaction. Here trust is maintained while doing each transaction, and hence
    the desired people alone can be able to access the data. While considering all
    this, the latency also has to be maintained so that data can be accessed in a
    lesser time. Figure [9.2](#Fig2) shows the blockchain importance (Dhillon & Metcalf,
    [2017](#CR13)).![../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.png)

    All the blocks are linked, and each node is to be accessed with the help of a

    being authenticated. The user has to use the private key to get his/her data.
    The key will be validated before releasing any data to a user. Here the consensus

    this, web applications are utilized to do the transaction. The data may be transmitted
    locally after authentication, or it will be sent to all ports using node-to-node
    communication in the network. When the data is locally authenticated, the data
    is sent among the local nodes. But it may not be common for all the networks.
    It may vary accordingly based on the rules. Every transaction will be validated
    and then transferred to the network, and the pending documents will be validated
    by keeping them in a queue. This is called a consensus between blocks (Guo et
    al., [2018](#CR17)). The first consensus is done; the notes can be transferred
    between various notes after validation. Once validation is done, it will be added
    to the database or ledger. Protocols need to be set for consensus. It is not possible
    to introduce a block simultaneously near a particular time. It will create a problem
    in the chain. All the blocks are taken and computed the measured function value.

    disease. This helps subside the spreading of any disease and helps the patients
    provide proper dugs for a speedy recovery. The data created for this purpose has

    private network and end-to-end encrypted messaging system. Smart contracts have
    been a major part of ethereum models. More public networks can be connected with
    this architecture, and this architecture connects all the nodes via hash functions.
    The hash functions are represented as e-hash as an indication of ethereum models.
    This function of representation is highly stable and adaptable so that the network
    is not limited to the new blocks and the transaction count. The consensus algorithm
    which uses the fault identification and tolerance methodology are adapted to the
    centralized application, and the records are maintained with lower security. The
    e-hash can handle more models and block with better security even if this can
    detect the oddity transaction and inconsistent network access. The blocks are
    connected to the other blocks in neural network models, and it can be detected
    using e-hash functions (Balaji et al., [2021](#CR8)). The major part of smart
    contracts is related to the different states and exchange of the events and functions
    whose scripting is done by solidity tools, whereas other tools such as testnet,
    Kovan, and Remix are payable versions for the transactions.
  prefs: []

    and proclaiming. It is done by a solidity tool. The real-time collected data are
    compiled, and then the corresponding byte codes are used for proclaiming the smart
    contract to the next ethereum network. Ethereum machines send the byte code to
    the next block via the web servers; the simplification of this network is performed
    on each interaction of the machines and then confirms the process via different
    blocks (Kumar et al., [2020](#CR21)). The blocks then send to the next block in
    an encoded manner, and the status of each block with the transaction is transmitted
    with the next block; then it is updated to the remaining blocks of the same network.
    Similarly, other blocks that are involved in the process of creating the smart
    contracts for the transaction will be updated to the other blocks as it is synchronous
    decentralized systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These smart contracts are the basic block that holds the transaction details,
    and the e-hash is specially used in these nodes (Swan, [2015](#CR39)). The same
    models are constituted of the medical data and the healthcare records like statistical
    model analysis. Each record acts as a block, and every part is connected with
    the node as individual and connected nodes. The medical records hold a large number
    of data and then share the routes of access with the owner under authorization.
    The smart contracts are encrypted, and it is end-to-end cryptography so that all
    the block properties are maintained on the entire network (Balaji et al., [2020](#CR6)).
    The digitally signed authentication is to carry out the ledgers and make the data
    exchange. Even though it is encrypted, it blocks certain protocols which are regulated
    to follow the authentication process and helps to access the healthcare unit ledger
    which is represented as byte codes. So that different e-hash codes are carried
    out between the consultant and the third party insurance agent. The process of
    authenticating is regulated so that data integrity is improved with highly secure
    access. Henceforth to access the data by the unauthorized person needs hash functions.
    It should be approved by the patients or the doctors to view the records. Also,
    this system could access the details of health data digitally, and it is more
    eco-friendly. Figure [9.8](#Fig8) shows the various methodologies used in the
    transaction in a blockchain model.![../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig8_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig8_HTML.png)

    is required to access the data. Any stakeholder represented in Fig. [9.8](#Fig8)
    can access the data at any time if the e-hash function is available. Each block
    is connected with the other block via the web server and web access. This is connected
    to the ethereum network, so that the authorization is done between the patient
    and the doctors or consultant who are connected to the particular architecture.
    The different access and various events are explained in Fig. [9.9](#Fig9), with
    the control unit and hash functions. Then each function is extended to its end
    so that all the processes are connected to the smart contacts via the described
    embedded codes. It enables the architecture to the decentralized nodes to manage
    them, and it will connect to all the nodes and reduce unauthorized access with
    improved administration. The access data are shared only between the doctor and
    the consultant to follow the process and sharing with other third-party accesses.
    The blockchain enables technology in the healthcare unit that has provided more
    security, and smart contracts ease the access and track them. The ethereum is
    connected with different hospitals that are taken as an individual node. Hence
    all the data is accessed to the external server and ensures the ease of access
    from the cloud at any time, but security is high. Also, the same system with authorization
    from the patient provides the customized notification whenever the hash key is
    modified, and then if any external party is access to the data, it can be accepted
    or rejected based upon the user requirement. Then the main access is connected
    to all the nodes, and individual responses of the node transactions are tracked
    at the various nodes. The blocks of e-hash always hold the transactions. The same
    is transferred with other nodes for security and data integrity processes.![../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_9_Chapter/504166_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png)

    body condition so that they can know how to keep their bodies healthy. Most of
    the people are ignorant of regular health checkups and also not ready to share
    their data with all the year counterparts. This makes them not to be healthy and
    not aware of their health. So blockchain plays a very vital role here by having
    the data in every secured way, and a concerned person can have his data in his
    hands so that he can view his health status at any point in time. Henceforth,
    a lot of people take medicines on their own and avoid their data to become transparent.

    Figure [9.9](#Fig9) shows the centralized blockchain network. To optimize the
    design process, this blockchain model is adopted with the consensus type. A total
    of four virtual models are created as hospital end servers. Each hospital is connected
    to the centralized blockchain network. Each transaction from the patient or consultant
    is tracked by this server and is updated to the local database. The hash details
    on the transaction are maintained as separate dataset to check the node-to-node
    transmission as hash functions.

    Hospital A server can be utilized for the transaction verification, and hospital
    B server is used for validation of blocks and duplication of hash functions. Similarly,
    hospitals C and D are used for the verification at the pharmacy and report generation
    to the lab. Patient details and the required medicine details after consultation
    with medicos are encrypted, and it is stored in the decentralized server. Through
    this consensus hybrid system, these details are stored in an encrypted format.
    Whenever the patient is approaching the pharmacy, he can use the hash function
    to retrieve the health records and update the changes. Hence this blockchain network
    provides more security on health record maintenance and shares with only authenticated
    users. The local database is updated for every hash value change, and the log
    file is maintained as a ledger network of consensus network. It also exhibits
    the response of public and private networks of blockchain between different nodes.
    Figure [9.9](#Fig9) illustrates the implementation of blockchain model for communication
    with a different node. The general server-client mechanism (SCM) is entirely different
    from the centralized blockchain mechanism. The SCM and BC characteristics are
    compared under the following category (Table [9.2](#Tab2)):'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This research work focuses on the implementation ways of blockchain in the healthcare
    sector. The security of patient data is improved using this technology. The third-party
    users cannot access the various data such as medical records, insurance details,
    and the patient’s past health records. The blockchain provides the end-to-end
    encryption security, and the process is dealing with the generation of e-hash
    functions. The e-hash consists of smart contracts with different stages for compiling
    and maintaining the records. Each node shares the ledger of data which consists
    of blocks, and the chain is connected with them. Every change in the blocks and
    nodes is shared with the decentralized network. Henceforth, all the node changes,
    and the block transactions are shared in the network for access by the patient
    and doctor. Authentication is required to access the data without patient approval.
    The web servers are connected with the other parts of nodes, so the overall process
    is connected to the blocks of the chain. The limitations of the traditional method
    can be overcome by using e-hash. The general medicine, drug tracking, and supply
    chain are also managed using this technology using peer-to-peer communication.
    The stored and secured data access helps the researchers and medical students
    analyze the effect of disease and the more quick invention of them. In the future,
    the blockchain may be added with AI technology using the collaborative robot which
    plays a role in automated surgery without human interaction.
