- en: 'Before we look at the relationship between Blockchain technology and other
    emerging technologies, it is worth looking at the risks and ‘perceived’ risks
    in adopting this new technology. As with all transformations, implementing Blockchain
    technology will not be easy and there will be many issues along the way, but I
    am 100% confident that the benefits more than outweigh the risks. As with any
    transformation project, do you own research first.  ## Change – Inertia of People'

    are fearful of what they do not understand.

    change, and want to be at the forefront of new technologies (I would argue that
    you are an early adopter, because you are reading the first comprehensive book
    on commercializing Blockchain). These people are important to the community and
    to your organization and you must help them to champion the development of Blockchain
    technology.

    which means that people do not see the benefits of Blockchain technology in the
    non-crypto world. This has changed slowly during 2018, but it is still the starting
    point of many conversations about Blockchain technology. I have had many a discussion
    with C-level executives on the fact that Blockchain technology is not Bitcoin;
    it is Bitcoin that is the first use case of Blockchain technology. As more and
    more Blockchain use cases are developed, this misunderstanding will slowly disappear.

    with Blockchain technology it is a different way to think – from front to back.
    This is a big change for many people who are process driven, they are used to
    entering data and then reconciling and auditing post the transaction; as we know,
    with Blockchain technology, the data is verified and certified as it enters the
    Blockchain. This 180-degree change is hard to understand after a lifetime of working
    the opposite way around. Once the users understand this, they will be well on
    the way to adopting the revolution powered by Blockchain technology.  ## User’s
    Adoption'

    If we cannot interact with a Blockchain solution in an easy and intuitive way,
    we will not adopt this. As I have mentioned previously, the first cryptocurrency
    wallets are very difficult to work with and result in many people not adopting
    them. We have to ensure that the end result is useable and what the customers
    want. The end user needs to be able to use the technology with the same ease they
    use today's technologies; anything that is more complex is likely to be left on
    the shelf.

    than the technology. If you bring the people on board with the journey, using
    their expertise, as well as the full ecosystem, then you will be able to collectively
    solve the issues around scale and complexity.  ## Standardization'
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With any new technology, there is a period before standards are established,
    where the technology's competing parties try to be ‘the’ only standard in the
    industry. There is a rush at the moment to be ‘the’ Blockchain solution, which
    I believe is completely pointless. The fact that Blockchain technology is decentralized
    means that we do not need one solution and one main provider.
  id: totrans-15

    across the internet or standards across the telecoms industry, we need to agree
    a set of standards on the operating of the Blockchain technologies. This is the
    key reason why I say that Blockchain is still at 0.7 or 0.8, we need these standards
    to take this revolutionary technology to 1.0 and then onwards.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next stage of standardization is with interoperability and ensuring that
    there are processes and standards in place for transferable systems and data agreements.
    These will help to allow all the different Blockchain solutions ‘communicate’
    together and across the entire ecosystem.
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, whatever the standard, they have to be easy to implement and understandable
    across the entire ecosystem globally. The standards and interoperability standards
    will need to cover all geographies and use cases, which means this will take time
    and interactions.
  id: totrans-18

    and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, where they have agreed to pool and share

    speed up the development of Blockchain technology to 1.0 and beyond.  ## Government'

    the UK government and see lots of other governments ‘looking at’ Blockchain technology,
    but do they really comprehend the significant benefits that this will bring to
    their countries, across all areas of government. From Digital ID to healthcare
    tracking to digital title deeds to digital payments, their entire system can be
    revolutionized with Blockchain technology.
  id: totrans-20

    they are highly siloed and risk-averse. They lack the correct knowledge and awareness,
    and unfortunately, they believe the fake news which we see on a daily basis. This
    will change over time and there are governments in countries such as Estonia,
    Malta, and UAE, where they are taking Blockchain technology seriously, and will
    have an excellent head start on the governments who are not embracing this revolution.

    worlds; it makes sense as they are the complete opposite of a decentralized organization.

    become decentralized, I expect them to adopt the Blockchain technology based on
    decentralization and sharing, to help benefit their countries and citizens.  ##

    and trust – neither of these two words have been used to describe the ‘system’
    for many years (if ever). My view is that if you are to allow Blockchain technology
    to be implemented across all organizations, there will be many people opposed
    to this new transparency. That is why I believe there is a concerted effort to
    slow down the implementation of this technology, and some of the reasons are bona
    fide.

    mix of national regulations crossing all organizations and borders.
  id: totrans-30

    that Blockchain technology will bring.

    the younger generations do not agree with the current ‘system’. They tend to lack
    trust in governments, law enforcement, and the large organizations that run the
    world. They want transparency and trust, and more understanding and a voice in
    the future of the world. They have unlimited access to technology and are born
    with the internet – there is nothing that they cannot find out.

    understanding of and interest in a world with Blockchain technology. Most of the
    students and graduates I speak to have a ‘standard’ interest in Blockchain technology.
    By ‘standard’ I mean they see it as an interesting opportunity to change the status
    quo now, and they view it alongside many other emerging technologies. This healthy
    attitude has to be countered with the understanding of the practicalities of a
    decentralized world.

    organizations around the world to improve themselves, their staff, and their customers’
    lives.  ## Ignorance'
