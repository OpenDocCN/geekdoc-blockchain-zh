- en: While the dizzying evolution of the internet has transformed how we access data
    and communicate, advances in data integrity and storage have limped along. We
    can use the internet to instantaneously pinpoint an obscure eatery in Borneo,
    watch cat videos, or share our views worldwide. But even with the advent of cloud
    storage technologies, data still gets lost, corrupted, censored, accidentally
    deleted, hacked, stolen, and destroyed.

- en: Blockchain could eliminate all of these problems. Pioneered in 2008 as a method
    of verifying cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain consists of a time-stamped,
    append-only series of blocks of immutable data that is not owned by any single
    entity. Once a *block* of data is added to the *chain* using cryptography, it
    can’t be removed or modified. Bad actors can’t change it. Censors can’t remove
    it. Hackers can’t steal what’s already been shared. It might be as revolutionary
    for data integrity and recording as the internet has been for data access.

    rest on knowing that the data we have actually reflects reality. Take, for example,
    supply chain: If it were possible, by reviewing a blockchain, to know with certainty
    that inventory was in a particular place, or arrived or left at a particular time,
    the cost of verifying its presence would steeply decline. And since these time-stamped
    transaction records couldn’t be manipulated, the likelihood of fraud would drop
    just as sharply. In so many other industries and functions, blockchain could reduce
    frictions and shrink bureaucracy to the point where entirely new business models
    are possible. This book will help you understand what will change, when, and how
    to prepare.'

    of the MIT crypto-economics lab, I spend a lot of time researching how blockchain
    will affect industry. Blockchain’s impact may be slow-moving, but it could ultimately
    be staggering. Decades may pass before the ramifications of profound new technologies
    and innovations emerge, and the changes they bring tend not to happen where one
    might expect. Volta invented the electric battery in 1800, but the development
    of one that was useful for industrial applications took at least sixty years.
    After the dot-com bust in 2000, it would have been easy to conclude that the internet
    held limited potential as a way to sell goods.

    several blockchain-based startups, some people are going to make similar mistakes.
    Don’t write off blockchain, and don’t ignore it because it seems too complicated—misjudging
    the pivotal moment we are living in could leave your business struggling to catch
    up. How many companies that underestimated the internet would like to do the year
    2000 over again if they could?

    we can’t yet be sure how blockchain technology will change society, we shouldn’t
    sit back and watch transformation happen without us. The insights in this volume
    sketch out how major industries, governments, marketing practices, and investment
    patterns could change substantially once data integrity has leaped forward. Use
    them to prepare yourself and your company for the promising blockchain future.
