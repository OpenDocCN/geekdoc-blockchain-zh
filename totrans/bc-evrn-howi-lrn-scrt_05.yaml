- en: Poker Night was usually held at Kirk’s house. Of the four of us, he was the
    bachelor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My friend had an obsession with J. R. R. Tolkien, so his house was filled with
    Lord of the Rings paraphernalia, like the exquisite hand-drawn map of Middle-earth
    that covered a wall, and the shiny hobbit sword that hung over the fireplace.
    This was not a movie prop; this was a legit sword.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Kirk looked a little like a hobbit: he was one of my few friends who were shorter
    than me. He was also the spitting image of CNBC’s Jim Cramer—though a kinder and
    gentler version.'

    is some epic journey.”

    was never sure how much he was getting, and how much he was missing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You guys in?” asked Ben. He was dealing out poker chips at Kirk’s circular
    Vegas-style poker table. If Kirk was the hobbit, Ben was the stoic elf, and Evan
    was the swarthy Greek dwarf.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    getting my MBA at Wharton. It’s really interesting. Like electronic cash, but
    it’s peer-to-peer.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    should appeal to your libertarian streak. I’ll bet five.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of knowing half smile that could be either charming or intimidating or both.
  prefs: []

    to your investor streak.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    didn’t look happy, so I raised. “Five to stay in.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kirk hesitated. “Fold.” I scooped up my winnings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So what do you actually have?” Ben asked. “When I buy stocks, I get a stock
    certificate. Do you get a receipt or something?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Like a physical key?” asked Kirk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, a long string of text and numbers. Like an email address.” I dealt cards
    as I spoke. “I can share my public key with anyone, like an email address. But
    I’m the only one with access to the private key. Like a password.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What if you lose the private key?” Ben asked, knocking on the table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Then you lose it all.” I turned to Kirk with my best Ian McKellen impersonation.
    “So keep it secret. Keep it safe.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evan knocked. The bet was to me, and I sat for a moment, riffling my Vegas-style
    poker chips. They made a satisfying chick-chick-chick. The odds were good that
    I could walk away with the pot, even though I only had a king. But maybe Ben was
    also bluffing? Chick-chick-chick.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    pushed in a fat stack of chips.

  prefs: []

    “And the return of the king,” he said, giving my cards back to me.

- en: Luca Pacioli was a sixteenth-century Franciscan monk who was also a genius mathematician.
    He hung out with Leonardo da Vinci, developed a method for teaching algebra that
    was easy and accessible—and, in his spare time, invented accounting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Accountant Monk was also a professional simplifier. Accounting had been
    used for hundreds of years, but Pacioli literally wrote the manual. He preached
    the gospel of accounting, and the other gospel as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Pacioli invented the idea of double-entry bookkeeping: credits on one side,
    debts on the other. This not only allowed us to keep count of who owed what, but
    it ushered in a new age of prosperity and our modern financial system. It was
    a monumental mathematical achievement.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Pacioli also invented the concept of an accounting ledger. You use one every
    time you balance your checkbook or view your online banking account. To Pacioli,
    a balanced checkbook was a “moral obligation,”^([2](notes.html#ch00-fn2)) and
    clean books were reflective of a clean soul.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the love of money is the root of all evil, Pacioli reasoned, then proper
    accounting is the root of all good. The proper allocation of value—to the places
    where it belongs—is how all human goodness takes root and flourishes (just as
    his ideas are taking root and flourishing even now in your mind).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the years, the accounting ledger stayed centralized, meaning it was owned
    by a person (like an accountant) or an institution (like a bank). This works fine
    if you have the Accountant Monk doing your bookkeeping, but not all accountants
    are saints.

- en: In fact, many of the financial meltdowns we have experienced in recent times—from
    the Enron disaster of 2001 to the collapse of the global economy in 2008—stemmed
    from deceptive accounting and a lack of financial transparency. We trust accountants
    and auditors to tell us the truth, but who’s auditing the auditors?
  prefs: []

    is tired of all these corrupted companies cooking the books. He wants an upgrade.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accounting ledgers keep track of credits and debits, inflows and outflows of
    money. The blockchain is just putting those accounting ledgers online so the public
    can verify they’re accurate. It’s like open-source data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That paragraph is the key to understanding blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a blockchain-based currency like bitcoin, everyone can see every transaction
    that’s been made—every bitcoin bought or sold—since the beginning of the chain.
    Because it’s open for everyone to see, everyone can verify that the ledger is
    correct. Safe, honest, and clean.

  prefs: []

    ledger sitting on an accountant’s desk, the ledger is distributed across many
    hundreds or millions of users across the Internet. It’s like a giant checkbook
    that we all balance together.

    of poker chips. “I can send five to you, five to Ben, five to John.” He pushed
    piles to each of us. “This is all stored on the ledger like a giant checkbook.
    But no one owns the checkbook. It’s open for everyone to see. Open-source money.”
