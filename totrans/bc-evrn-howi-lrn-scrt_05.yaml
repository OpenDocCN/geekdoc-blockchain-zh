- en: My friend had an obsession with J. R. R. Tolkien, so his house was filled with
    Lord of the Rings paraphernalia, like the exquisite hand-drawn map of Middle-earth
    that covered a wall, and the shiny hobbit sword that hung over the fireplace.
    This was not a movie prop; this was a legit sword.

  zh: 我的朋友对J. R. R. 托尔金有着迷般的爱好，所以他的房子里摆满了《指环王》的周边，比如覆盖了一面墙的精美手绘中土世界地图，以及挂在壁炉上方的闪亮的霍比特人剑。这不是电影道具；这是一把真正的剑。

- en: If the love of money is the root of all evil, Pacioli reasoned, then proper
    accounting is the root of all good. The proper allocation of value—to the places
    where it belongs—is how all human goodness takes root and flourishes (just as
    his ideas are taking root and flourishing even now in your mind).

- en: Over the years, the accounting ledger stayed centralized, meaning it was owned
    by a person (like an accountant) or an institution (like a bank). This works fine
