    business process flow automation, operations, or development), enterprises will
    see increased efficiency in their business and reduction of the total cost of
    ownership. There will be lesser defects due to human errors, and enterprises will
    move away from active monitoring to active auditing. Ultimately, this means there

    well-known example of such a disruption was the Stuxnet attack in Iran. In January
    2010, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting the Natanz
    uranium enrichment plant in Iran noticed that filters used to enrich uranium gas
    were failing at an unprecedented rate. The cause was a complete mystery, and Iranian
    technicians replaced the filters. Five months later, a seemingly unrelated event
    occurred. A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot a
    series of computers in Iran that were crashing and rebooting repeatedly. The researchers

    The interoperability issues in IoT can be seen from different perspectives due
    to heterogeneity. Heterogeneity  is not a new concept nor restricted to a domain.
    Even in the physical world, there are many types of heterogeneities, for example,
    people speak dissimilar languages, but they can still communicate with each other
    through a translator (human/tools) or by using a common language. Likewise, the
    diverse elements comprising IoT (devices, communications, services, applications,
    etc.) should seamlessly cooperate and communicate with each other to realize the
    full potential of the IoT ecosystem.

    interoperability, syntactic interoperability, semantic interoperability, and platform

    Several efforts have emerged to establish standards for providing interoperability

    The European Union has also recently funded several research projects under the
    H2020 program focusing on the federation of IoT platforms. However, it may take
    a long time before the related standards are fully agreed upon and accepted, if
    ever.

    issues can be resolved, thereby ensuring that solutions built now can be future-proofed.
    To set expectations right, interoperability should be aspired specific to an industry
    rather than cross industries, else it will lead to disasters in IoT implementation.
    What this means is that the different hardware and software that are part of the
    IoT architecture should be interoperable to implement use cases within an industry
    domain such as manufacturing or retail or pharmaceutical. As an example, Gateways
    built for IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) should be able to communicate with
    sensors and devices built for hospitals and are not required to interoperate with
    sensors and devices used in manufacturing.

    the format to do so (such as XML or JSON). The message sender encodes data in
    a message using syntactic rules, specified in some grammar. The message receiver
    decodes the received message using syntactic rules defined in the same or some

    the cloud, the Internet of Things, and so on, and each of these technologies is
    redefining the definition of digital in their own way. Interestingly, it is not
    a big deal to implement these technologies if it is implemented one at a time.
    These technologies are all nice and create some new opportunities for enterprises,
    but the key reason for any enterprise to embark on a digital transformation journey
    is because they want to be seen as a great company. And to be a great company,
    they need to get the basics right and then use these new technologies to make
    themselves more special. So along the way of this technology evolution, everyone
    needs to understand that it is not about individual technologies that make an
    enterprise great or different, but it is more about the confluence of these technologies
    that creates opportunities for businesses to change the way they had been doing
    business earlier and be more competent in the future. With the technologies we
    have in the market today, the technical limitations we had in the past are eliminated,
    and therefore enterprises can run their business much more efficiently.

    recognize a new technology, and they think they can have a new strategy. So companies
    have introduced a mobile strategy, a big data strategy, a social media strategy,
    an Internet of Things strategy, a cloud strategy, and a cognitive computing strategy,
    and this is how many companies have operated so far in silos of each technology,
    which is a very bad idea. It is a bad idea not because these enterprises want
    to onboard new technologies but because there is no business strategy underpinning
    these technologies – as an example, a mobile strategy will not make a business
    successful.

    mean a grocery store entering into a clothing business or the same grocery store
    entering into a radically different business line, such as cloud computing, for
    example, Amazon. Such competitors undermine the viability of your product service
    portfolio or your go-to-market approach. In other words, they find ways to make
    your customers happier than you do, by either offering them new kinds of relationships
    or a new product service for portfolio or a better customer experience than you

    Still others push more boldly, using connectivity to create entirely new products

    Transformations  are aimed at the fundamental building blocks of how value is
    delivered in the industry. Examples of this kind of innovation are well known,
    from Netflix’s reinvention of video distribution to Apple’s reinvention of music
    delivery (iTunes) and Uber’s reinvention of the taxi industry. This kind of transformation
    should however be occurring in every industry, and IoT can support such a transformation.
    Insurance companies, such as Allstate, are using IoT with data and analytics to
    unbundle insurance contracts and charge customers by the mile, which is a big
    change to the auto insurance business model. Although not yet a reality, there
    are also numerous efforts underway to transform the business of mining to a wholly
    robotic exercise using IoT, where no humans would be required to travel below

    asset sharing model that is allowing enterprises to create a new business model

    model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An asset sharing model allows enterprises to share their costly IoT-enabled
    assets with other business entities or users. A clear example of an asset sharing
    model is the electric scooters that are now on the streets of the UK. IoT-connected
    devices combined with consumers’ pay-per-use for a product is the model that is
    getting more prevalent in the world. The organization sharing the asset can charge
    for the asset based on the usage, time for the usage, and nature of the usage,
    which is similar to the outcome business model. In this model, a customer rents
    assets, but whatever they do not use is then fed back into the system. Instead
    of renting out an equipment to one customer, with asset sharing the customer has
    the asset for a specific amount of time. In this way, the products are circulating
    the market quicker, and the product is benefitting from full utilization across
    several customers. This also determines how long the asset is lying idle and not
    in use. In this use case, rather than taking the asset and only paying for the
    time customers use it or the outputs, customers rent the asset for a set amount
    of time, and when they are finished, it is then passed on to the next customer.
    With an IoT system, the assets are connected to the Internet to ensure they are
    not stolen and can be easily tracked for usage and wear and tear.

    power plant with AI and IoT networks, mapping a power plant virtually to control
    the inputs and outputs and to make use of any excess supply of energy during power
    outages. These plants do not own the energy assets; they own the data that is
    transferred between each piece of equipment in the network.

    do not appreciate the real opportunity for these new technologies to unlock wholly
    new businesses for their companies beyond currently served markets. Often, it
    is this type of transformation that offers the greatest opportunities to create
    new value. A clear example how Domain Transformation works is the online retailer
    Amazon. Amazon expanded into a new market domain with the launch of Amazon Web
    Services (AWS), now the largest cloud computing service provider, in a domain
    formerly owned by IT giants such as Microsoft and IBM. What made Amazon’s entry
    into this domain possible was a combination of the strong digital capabilities
    it had built in storage, computing databases to support its core retail business
    coupled with an installed base of thousands of relationships with young, growing
    companies that increasingly needed computing services to expand. AWS is not a
    mere adjacency or business extension for Amazon, but a wholly different business
    in a fundamentally different marketspace.

    input (such as labor, materials, machines, and capital) into goods and services
    or output. But today it is no longer limited to measuring ratios of inputs and
    outputs. Increasing productivity just means working smarter, and enterprises can
    look for opportunities to improve efficiency just about anywhere – some may consider
    cost takeout by optimizing existing operations or production lines as a productivity
    improvement strategy  , and some may want to bring improvements in their current
    operations by reducing manual interventions, thereby improving quality and leading
    to reduce cost of failures. With IoT technology comes the possibility of automation.
    Smart offices make use of a number of connected devices that monitor, control,
    and manage various operations across a business. Using these to automate repetitive
    tasks normally held by employees can increase efficiency and free up their time
    to focus on more complex work.

    Smart tags and sensors help keep track of inventory levels in real time and even
    track where an item is in a warehouse or store. This allows for more efficient
    stocking, which can improve companies’ cash flow. More precise inventory tracking

    for ABC Retail, where a salesman can retrieve specific data about a customer,

    shoes. The salesman comes back in a few minutes with a few dark blue trousers
    and a few pointed black shoes which are exactly of the same size and favorite
    colors of customer A. This is not a magic. The salesman was able to do that because
    of the capabilities that ABC Retail has created under him. ABC Retail created
    a totally transparent supply chain capability where each salesman within ABC Retail
    has access to the past events and purchases of their customers. Based on these
    insights, the salesman in this specific example understood that customer A has
    got a new job. Based on the past one-year buying patterns, he also got to know
    customer A’s shoe and dress sizes and favorite colors, based on which he was able

    that the digital transformation journey should not be embarked just for optimizing
    costs in an enterprise. Digital transformation journeys are embarked by a need
    for enterprises to do business differently and adapt to any changing business

    simply to survive in the market. It is critical to embrace the dynamic landscape,
    as new economic opportunities are continually opening for organizations that need
    to quickly build and scale robust environments. Transforming the entire operations
    of an enterprise is extremely complex and can present a significant risk if not
    executed correctly. Without the right guidance and experience, it is all too easy
    to focus purely on technology adoption to drive the successful implementation
    of digital transformation strategy, overlooking the impact the changes will have
    on the rest of the organization. The result is high implementation costs, missed

    and is successful only if it is done at an enterprise level. This does not mean
    that organizations need to embark on a digital transformation journey and make
    big changes to their already existing IT and OT systems, tools, and processes.
    What this means is that digital transformation should be embarked by utilizing
    a well-defined enterprise-level digital transformation methodology. Without an
    enterprise-level methodology, enterprises cannot succeed in their efforts toward
    digital transformation, and IoT Standards addresses just this. IoT Standards is
    an enterprise-wide digital transformation model that empowers all types of organizations
    to embark on digital transformation journeys using IoT, thereby allowing enterprises
    to achieve the full benefits of digital at scale by first understanding the business
    drivers behind the transformation and then enabling transformation using IoT.
    The results of IoT Standards implementation are achieving greater alignment and

    impact from an IoT pilot. We all need to understand that a single use case just
    would not prove the benefits of IoT. It has to be implemented at scale both in
    terms of the number of use cases and the breadth to demonstrate the impact. More
    widespread implementation of IoT use cases forces a cultural shift and provides
    new perspectives to the board and business on the benefits of IoT. In a ripple
    effect, this momentum often also exposes weakness in technology along with gaps
    in talent, both in terms of in-house IoT skill levels and the numbers of experts
    needed to implement IoT at scale. The “go big” approach may seem counterintuitive,
    particularly among enterprises that have fewer resources to deploy and feel more
    comfortable focusing on a small number of use cases. While a smaller scale may
    be good for very early days, there is a clear learning curve that companies achieve
    as they add use cases, and the sooner the learnings are achieved, the better it
    is for the enterprise. I have personally experienced that a greater number of
    use cases correlate with economic success regardless of the use case or type of
    company.

    their enterprise, the next set of use cases that form part of the Warm zone will
    prove the worth of IoT if implemented at scale. As discussed, use cases that are
    complex but at the same time have high impact to achieve the business objective
    are placed in the Warm zone. Complexity may be complemented with an increasing
    cost, but at the same time these are use cases that have much higher impact on
    the business strategy.

    the board level executives supported me when I realized and told them that the
    IoT deployment strategy which we originally designed is not bold enough. We initially
    decided to deploy IoT with six use cases (called minimum viable products  or MVPs
    in this organization) from the Hot zone, but soon I realized that this narrow
    focus will not improve performance as much as expected, neither will we be able
    to achieve the outcomes that the board will appreciate. A few leaders from across
    the enterprise pushed against voices of caution and expanded the number of MVPs
    to 15, and we went to an extent to select a few MVPs from the Warm zone. Executives
    also found that giving managers a larger number of IoT use cases to oversee focused
    their attention on creating a bias to make IoT a success. That momentum built
    on itself as the company’s best talent wanted to be part of the innovative push
    using IoT. A strong base of 21 IoT scrum teams was formed for these 15 MVPs which
    helped loosen bureaucratic decision-making rules. Finally, unexpected efficiencies
    turned up as engineers were able to reuse similar data architectures for multiple
    MVPs and found numerous synergies with each other. At the end, such an aggressive
    IoT use case strategy produced new revenue streams as well as improved the business
    process efficiencies between 60% and 80% and reduced costs between 28% and 67%
    for the specific business processes that these 15 MVPs were part of.

    Enterprises typically choose uses cases from this zone for implementation once
    they have implemented all use cases within the Hot zone and the Warm zone. Some
    use cases that have dependencies on use cases from the Hot and Warm zones are
    also placed in this zone which are called the use case subsets. With a combination
    of the use cases in the Hot and Warm zones, the use case subsets (i.e., dependent
    use case) in the Cold zone can generate additional value to enterprises.

    or opportunities identified within the business process based on which the use
    cases have been defined.

    A scan-and-go is a modern shopping technique where a customer can scan items as
    they shop using their mobile phones or a specific device provided by the store
    and then do self-checkout without the need of a store cashier.

    major retailers in the United States and the UK,^([4](#Fn4)) it was found that
    there were product losses of as much as 10 basis points for every 1% of sales

    scan-and-go, product losses could go up an additional 1%. According to the [National
    Retail Federation](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/retail-shrink-tops-50-billion-cyber-threats-become-more-priority),^([5](#Fn5))
    retailers currently lose around 1.4% of their product stock each year through

    the legacy mobile application named “Alerting App” which stores the personnel
    use to receive alerts was not capable of receiving real-time alerts. This defeats
    the whole idea of implementing this use case, and therefore an IT Application
    modernization was performed on the Alerting App in parallel to implementing an
    IoT solution. The Alerting App was rewritten using modern technology stack, thereby
    enabling real-time alerts to store personnel.
