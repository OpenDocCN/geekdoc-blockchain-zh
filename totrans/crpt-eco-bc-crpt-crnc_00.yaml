    change and who will be left behind? Decentralization, trust, privacy, and democratization
    of financial transactions are all ideas whose time has come. Blockchain technology
    will certainly drive these ideas over the next few years; the question is: Where
    will this happen? Some governments will embrace the technology of the future and
    others will resist, steadfastly clinging to the status quo. Who wins and who loses?'

    the Financial World, Aries Wanlin Wang expertly describes how this revolutionary
    new economy will function. As an insider who cofounded exchanges and has functioned
    successfully in the crypto economy over many years, he is the ultimate guide to
    this sometimes confusing new economy. Readers will no doubt benefit from his perspective
    and understanding of the concerns and motives of the people who make the economy

    and motivations of various nations and regulators to this new technology. As a
    representative of a Nongovernmental Organization (NGO) at the United Nations in
    New York City, I have heard the concerns of technology and information ministers
    from multiple countries all around the world. I am formerly an attorney for the
    United States government, so I have insight into how government regulators react
    when faced with new technologies. I am also the CEO of a startup company called
    Myntum Limited, which is building online vaults to secure critical digital assets
    (including cryptocurrencies and tokens). For this reason, I have been closely
    following developments in the crypto economy for the past two years. Finally,
    I am the founder of a nonprofit organization called First Freedoms, which advances
    the five freedoms listed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
    (freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly, and redress of grievances). What
    is the link between the First Amendment and crypto economy?

    and ideals of the First Amendment became part of the bedrock of the US’s emphasis
    on individual freedom. Now is the time for the ideas and ideals of blockchain
    and the crypto economy. And yet there are still questions that remain, which must
    ultimately be addressed:'

    have three options: support, oppose, or no position. The crypto economy desires
    support or neutral positions from governments. To accomplish this, most people
    in the crypto economy know they need to work with governments in various jurisdictions
    to enact smart regulation to help make the new economy thrive. Working with friendly
    jurisdictions to make the new crypto economy thrive also allows for the possibility
    of convincing governments that oppose it to change their policy.'

- en: So, decentralization or centralization? For centuries, financial transactions
    have required centralized banks or financiers—national banks, commercial banks,
    credit card issuers—to act as “trusted Third Parties” to facilitated transactions
    between two parties. Until blockchain technology arrived in 2008, no one had developed
    a sound and safe way to bypass the banks. With blockchain technology, individuals
    and businesses for the first time have the power to deal directly with each other.
    This sounds ideal, but there are important issues to work out, and I believe that
    sometimes involving a trusted Third Party is a good choice.

- en: Trust between parties or requiring a Third Party to ensure trust? The crypto
    economy provides individuals and businesses the option to either deal directly
    with each other or to deal in the traditional “fiat” currency economy involving
    a Third Party. I believe the future of cryptocurrency acceptance will involve
    crypto being used for relatively small purchases and fiat currency being used
    for relatively large purposes. At this time, there is no good method of dispute
    resolution in the cryptocurrency markets. There is no crying in crypto. If a transition
    goes badly, there is no one to complain to. In which jurisdiction would you file
    a complaint? I believe in the near future those involved in large transactions
    will continue use the traditional economy, but this is still good news for crypto!
    Most of the routine transactions every day are small transactions that are perfect
    for cryptocurrencies.

    transactions are transparent on a public ledger for the world to see. Each Bitcoin
    can only be used once. This is a radical departure from the fiat traditional economy,
    which uses the same dollar multiple times. The brilliant Ray Dalio of Bridgewater
    Associates described this in 2014 in “How the Economic Machine Works”:'

    to deliver money) rather than money itself. The total amount of debt in the US
    is about $50 trillion and the total amount of money (i.e., currency and reserves)
    in existence is about $3 trillion. So, if we were to use these numbers as a guide,
    the amount of promises to deliver money (i.e., debt) is roughly 15 times the amount
    of money there is to deliver.

    and there is no one scrambling for a seat in musical chairs. But if and when the
    music stops, there are fifty people fighting over three seats. This is what happens
    in economic crises. Because each Bitcoin can only be used once, this type of problem
    cannot happen.

- en: A borderless world with less political influence or a bordered world with more
    political influence? I’m an idealist. I am very much drawn to the idea of a borderless
    world. Technology is borderless. Financial transactions in theory can be borderless.
    In the traditional fiat economy and in the crypto economy, assets can be sent
    anywhere at the click of a mouse. This is not the reality, however. Governments
    sometimes get into disagreements and sanction one another and prohibit their citizens
    from doing business with one another. Businesses and individuals should absolutely
    respect the sanctions that their countries impose. A simple business principle?
    Respect and honor any regulator who can close you, litigate and fine you out of
    existence, or put you in prison.

    don’t get into ego-driven damaging political contests with one another. Algorithms
    don’t get into trade wars, or exchange tariffs. Algorithms don’t have historic
    rivalries, military ambitions, or leaders in search of glory. The borderless world
    and cryptocurrencies have great potential to democratize economic transactions
    and economic opportunity to the benefit of individuals all over the world.

    governments? Initial coin offerings, now more commonly called Token Generating
    Events (TGE), are simply crowdfunding. I believe that this democratization of
    business fundraising holds great promise, with smart regulation. Governments have
    a legitimate interest in stopping frauds. This is true in both the traditional
    economy and the crypto economy.

    largest economies are generally wary of upsetting the status quo. Their current
    economic policies have them in the G20! Many of the 180 countries NOT in the G20
    are willing to experiment. The top twenty economies in the world hold 80 percent
    of the world’s wealth. The other 172 countries are less thrilled with the status
    quo and view the crypto economy differently. This is a frequent topic of conversation
    at the United Nations. The developing world views the crypto economy and blockchain
    technology as a potential way to improve the lives of their citizens through TGEs.

    the potential of the technology. It’s important to understand that countries take
    their currencies seriously. Government planners in the United States, China, and
    the European Union are concerned about the potential of capital flight. Economists
    in the G20 countries might have to make projections based on imperfect data if
    they can’t figure out how to track every transaction!

    will need to work with governments regarding taxation as the markets mature. This
    cooperation will be a complicated culture clash, but I think it is necessary and
    will benefit all parties in the long term. Countries don’t want to push their
    best and brightest citizens, the businesses they will start, and the jobs they
    will create over borders.

    freedom for individuals and rewrite the way the globe does business.
