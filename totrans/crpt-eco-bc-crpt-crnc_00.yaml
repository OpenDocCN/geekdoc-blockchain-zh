    of financial transactions are all ideas whose time has come. Blockchain technology
    will certainly drive these ideas over the next few years; the question is: Where
    will this happen? Some governments will embrace the technology of the future and
    others will resist, steadfastly clinging to the status quo. Who wins and who loses?'

    the Financial World, Aries Wanlin Wang expertly describes how this revolutionary
    new economy will function. As an insider who cofounded exchanges and has functioned
    successfully in the crypto economy over many years, he is the ultimate guide to
    this sometimes confusing new economy. Readers will no doubt benefit from his perspective
    and understanding of the concerns and motives of the people who make the economy

- en: Through my varied professional experiences, I have insight into the concerns
    and motivations of various nations and regulators to this new technology. As a
    representative of a Nongovernmental Organization (NGO) at the United Nations in
    New York City, I have heard the concerns of technology and information ministers
    from multiple countries all around the world. I am formerly an attorney for the
    United States government, so I have insight into how government regulators react
    when faced with new technologies. I am also the CEO of a startup company called
    Myntum Limited, which is building online vaults to secure critical digital assets
    (including cryptocurrencies and tokens). For this reason, I have been closely
    following developments in the crypto economy for the past two years. Finally,
    I am the founder of a nonprofit organization called First Freedoms, which advances
    the five freedoms listed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
    (freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly, and redress of grievances). What
    is the link between the First Amendment and crypto economy?

    and the crypto economy. And yet there are still questions that remain, which must
    ultimately be addressed:'

- en: 'How do governments make decisions on new technology? In general, governments
    have three options: support, oppose, or no position. The crypto economy desires
    support or neutral positions from governments. To accomplish this, most people
    in the crypto economy know they need to work with governments in various jurisdictions
    to enact smart regulation to help make the new economy thrive. Working with friendly
    jurisdictions to make the new crypto economy thrive also allows for the possibility
    of convincing governments that oppose it to change their policy.'

  zh: 政府如何对新技术做出决策？一般来说，政府有三个选择：支持、反对或中立。加密经济希望政府能给予支持或中立立场。为了实现这一点，大多数加密经济中的人都清楚他们需要在各个司法管辖区与政府合作，实施明智的监管以帮助新经济繁荣。与友好的司法管辖区合作，使新的加密经济繁荣，也使说服反对它的政府改变政策成为可能。
- en: So, decentralization or centralization? For centuries, financial transactions
    have required centralized banks or financiers—national banks, commercial banks,
    credit card issuers—to act as “trusted Third Parties” to facilitated transactions
    between two parties. Until blockchain technology arrived in 2008, no one had developed
    a sound and safe way to bypass the banks. With blockchain technology, individuals
    and businesses for the first time have the power to deal directly with each other.
    This sounds ideal, but there are important issues to work out, and I believe that
    sometimes involving a trusted Third Party is a good choice.

  zh: 那么，是去中心化还是中心化？几个世纪以来，金融交易一直需要中央银行或金融家——国家银行、商业银行、信用卡发行商——作为“可信第三方”来促成两方之间的交易。直到2008年区块链技术出现，没有人开发出一种可靠且安全的方式绕过银行。有了区块链技术，个人和企业第一次有了直接相互交易的能力。这听起来很理想，但还有一些重要的问题需要解决，我相信有时候涉及一个可信的第三方是一个很好的选择。
- en: Trust between parties or requiring a Third Party to ensure trust? The crypto
    economy provides individuals and businesses the option to either deal directly
    with each other or to deal in the traditional “fiat” currency economy involving
    a Third Party. I believe the future of cryptocurrency acceptance will involve
    crypto being used for relatively small purchases and fiat currency being used
    for relatively large purposes. At this time, there is no good method of dispute
    resolution in the cryptocurrency markets. There is no crying in crypto. If a transition
    goes badly, there is no one to complain to. In which jurisdiction would you file
    a complaint? I believe in the near future those involved in large transactions
    will continue use the traditional economy, but this is still good news for crypto!
    Most of the routine transactions every day are small transactions that are perfect
    for cryptocurrencies.

  zh: 双方之间的信任还是需要第三方来确保信任？加密经济为个人和企业提供了直接相互交易或涉及第三方的传统“法定”货币经济的选项。我相信，加密货币的接受度将来会涉及到加密货币用于相对较小的购买，而法定货币用于相对较大的目的。目前，加密货币市场没有好的争议解决方法。在加密领域没有哭泣。如果过渡做得不好，就没有可以向之抱怨的人。您会在哪个司法管辖区提出投诉？我相信在不久的将来，参与大额交易的人将继续使用传统经济，但这对于加密来说仍然是好消息！大多数日常交易都是小额交易，非常适合加密货币。
- en: 'Transparency of transactions or hidden or opaque transactions? Cryptocurrency
    transactions are transparent on a public ledger for the world to see. Each Bitcoin
    can only be used once. This is a radical departure from the fiat traditional economy,
    which uses the same dollar multiple times. The brilliant Ray Dalio of Bridgewater
    Associates described this in 2014 in “How the Economic Machine Works”:'

  zh: 交易透明度还是隐藏或晦涩的交易？加密货币的交易是公开在公共账本上的，全世界的人都可以看到。每个比特币只能使用一次。这是与使用同样美元多次的传统法定经济的一个根本性的背离。桥水associates的辉煌雷·达里奥在2014年的《经济机器是如何运作的》一书中描述了这一点：
- en: Virtually all of what the Federal Reserve calls money is credit (i.e., promises
    to deliver money) rather than money itself. The total amount of debt in the US
    is about $50 trillion and the total amount of money (i.e., currency and reserves)
    in existence is about $3 trillion. So, if we were to use these numbers as a guide,
    the amount of promises to deliver money (i.e., debt) is roughly 15 times the amount
    of money there is to deliver.

  zh: 美联储所谓的几乎所有货币都是信用（即交付货币的承诺）而不是货币本身。美国的总债务约为50万亿美元，而流通中的总货币（即现金和准备金）约为3万亿美元。所以，如果我们以这些数字为参考，那么交付货币的承诺（即债务）的数量大约是现有货币的15倍。
- en: As long as the gears of this economic machine are turning, the music is playing
    and there is no one scrambling for a seat in musical chairs. But if and when the
    music stops, there are fifty people fighting over three seats. This is what happens

    cannot happen.

- en: A borderless world with less political influence or a bordered world with more
    political influence? I’m an idealist. I am very much drawn to the idea of a borderless
    world. Technology is borderless. Financial transactions in theory can be borderless.
    In the traditional fiat economy and in the crypto economy, assets can be sent
    anywhere at the click of a mouse. This is not the reality, however. Governments
    sometimes get into disagreements and sanction one another and prohibit their citizens
    from doing business with one another. Businesses and individuals should absolutely
    respect the sanctions that their countries impose. A simple business principle?
    Respect and honor any regulator who can close you, litigate and fine you out of
    existence, or put you in prison.

  zh: 一个没有边界的世界，政治影响较小，还是一个有边界的世界，政治影响较大？我是一个理想主义者。我非常倾向于一个没有边界的世界的想法。技术是无边界的。理论上，金融交易可以是无边界的。在传统法定货币经济和加密经济中，资产可以在点击鼠标的情况下发送到任何地方。然而，这并不是现实。政府有时会陷入分歧，对彼此实施制裁，禁止他们的公民相互开展业务。企业和个人绝对应该尊重他们国家实施的制裁。一个简单的商业原则？尊重并尊敬任何可以关闭你、通过诉讼并将你罚得倾家荡产，或把你送进监狱的监管机构。
- en: Cryptocurrencies are a borderless world with less political influence. Algorithms
    don’t get into ego-driven damaging political contests with one another. Algorithms
    don’t get into trade wars, or exchange tariffs. Algorithms don’t have historic
    rivalries, military ambitions, or leaders in search of glory. The borderless world
    and cryptocurrencies have great potential to democratize economic transactions
    and economic opportunity to the benefit of individuals all over the world.

- en: Crowdfunding for new businesses or only venture capital, investment banks, and
    governments? Initial coin offerings, now more commonly called Token Generating
    Events (TGE), are simply crowdfunding. I believe that this democratization of
    business fundraising holds great promise, with smart regulation. Governments have
    a legitimate interest in stopping frauds. This is true in both the traditional
    economy and the crypto economy.

  zh: 对于新企业来说，是众筹，还是仅仅只是风险投资、投资银行和政府？初始代币发行，现在更常见地被称为代币生成事件（TGE），其实质就是众筹。我相信，只要进行明智的监管，这种企业筹资的民主化将大有前途。政府有正当的理由去阻止欺诈行为。这在传统经济和加密经济中都是正确的。
- en: Regulations on TGEs vary greatly country by country. G20 countries with the
    largest economies are generally wary of upsetting the status quo. Their current
    economic policies have them in the G20! Many of the 180 countries NOT in the G20
    are willing to experiment. The top twenty economies in the world hold 80 percent
    of the world’s wealth. The other 172 countries are less thrilled with the status
    quo and view the crypto economy differently. This is a frequent topic of conversation
    at the United Nations. The developing world views the crypto economy and blockchain
    technology as a potential way to improve the lives of their citizens through TGEs.

- en: Crypto economy and blockchain leaders need to work with regulators to realize
    the potential of the technology. It’s important to understand that countries take
    their currencies seriously. Government planners in the United States, China, and
    the European Union are concerned about the potential of capital flight. Economists
    in the G20 countries might have to make projections based on imperfect data if
    they can’t figure out how to track every transaction!

- en: The elephant in the room regarding governments is taxes. The crypto economy
    will need to work with governments regarding taxation as the markets mature. This
    cooperation will be a complicated culture clash, but I think it is necessary and

    will create over borders.
