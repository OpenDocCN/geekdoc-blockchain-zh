    on the type of execution, there are market orders and pending orders. Pending
    orders, in turn, can be limit orders, stop orders, or stop limit orders. Each
    type of order can be used to buy or sell some kind of asset.

    market order. This order is executed at the current market price immediately after
    placing it on the exchange if there is a reverse limit order for it. For example,
    to execute a market buy order, a sell limit order is required. To execute a market
    sell order, a buy limit order is required.

- en: To execute a market order, the best one is chosen from all the available limit
    orders. Therefore, the market buy order is executed at the ask price, while market
    sell order is filled at the bid price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When dealing with this kind of order, you do not need to specify the price,
    just the volume, i.e. how much you want to buy. However, there is a big problem
    you can face – slippage. What is it? It is the difference between the expected
    price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. Slippage
    may occur during periods of higher volatility when market orders are used and
    also when there are large orders there may not be enough interest at the desired price
    level to maintain the expected price of trade. It is for this reason that I do
    not recommend using market orders at all.

    mentioned above: bid, ask, andsSpread. A bid is the price a buyer of the cryptocurrency

    difference between these two prices.'

    while the sellers set the price they want to sell an asset for. Put simply, it

    It is the situation observed on the cryptocurrency exchange.'

    be the first in this line, you must offer the best price. At the same time, sellers
    with the ask price also line up. The first in this line is also the one who offers
    the best price. Each price has an indication of the volume a buyer wants to buy
    or a seller wants to sell. Traders call such lines of pending orders on both the
    bid and ask side market depth.

    is always happy to earn something. If you place a market order, then be 99% sure
    you will never get the very first ask price. As a result, you’ve sent your order,
    and then, for example, get a price of 244.78.

    is an order to buy or sell a certain volume of an asset at a specific price. Here
    we consider two parameters: price and volume. For example, you place an order
    to buy coins for $5,000 at a price of $243.47\. The first option: you can place
    a buy limit order, for example, in the bid line. So you join the line of buyers
    waiting until their orders are filled. Another option: you can come to the sellers
    and make a deal at their price, but one which is not lower than yours.'

- en: However, it may happen there is no sufficient volume to fill your order. What
    should you do to get the needed volume? You should evaluate your order with regard
    to the overall liquidity of market depth. That is, you need to examine what orders
    have been placed. Theoretically, you have a chance to gather the first best positions
    regarding price and volume, but there is always a possibility that someone had
    already placed an order before you and took this volume because the information
    is sometimes displayed with a delay. If you still want to fill your order (not
    using a market order to avoid large slippage), you simply place a limit order
    at a price where your order will be definitely executed, not at a price you wish
    it were executed. This means that you are very likely to fill your order at a
    price offered by a seller. If these orders are in the market and you’ve managed
    to hit them, then you increase your chances of filling your order having offered
    a little bit outsized price.

    with those of a limit order. A stop-limit order requires the setting of two price
    points. The first point initiates the start of the specified action, referred
    to as the stop, while the second represents the outside of the investor’s target
    price, referred to as the limit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my opinion, a stop-limit order is even worse than a stop order. It does not
    guarantee the order execution, even if a price reaches a given stop price (because
    the limiter might not work). For this reason, I do not recommend using stop-limit
    orders to close position with a view to limit losses (stop-loss). In addition,
    not all brokers accept this type of trade order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, it seems that stop orders should protect you from losses because
    if something suddenly starts to fall, you can close the position. In fact, it
    doesn't work that way, and stop orders will be of no use. You might think that
    you place a stop order, it will definitely turn into a market order when the price
    reaches a specific level and your position will close. However, when you use a
    stop-limit order, it is logical that your stop turns into a limit. If there is
    a price in the market to execute your limit order, it will be executed. However,
    if the market does not offer such a price, you will simply stand in line and wait.
    Thus, I believe it does not make sense to use a stop-limit order.

    remains active until it is either rescinded by the investor or the trade is executed.
    In this regard, such an order is very convenient. Fill or Kill order is a limit
    order variation. If in the previous situations you placed a limit order, you may
    get only part of your desired volume, but with a Fill or Kill order, your order
    must be filled in its entirety or cancelled.

    borrow the rest from other players offering money. The balance of your margin
    account is used only to serve as this borrowed money and to cover loan costs if

    you don’t actually have. The borrowed capital you trade is called leverage.'

    Your margin is 25%. You buy for $40,000, and if the purchased currency starts
    to grow, your profit becomes four times larger, but if it all starts to fall,
    your losses are also four times larger. Accordingly, if you buy cryptocurrency
    for $10,000, you may lose all your money only if your asset (for example, Bitcoin)
    drops to zero. If you buy cryptocurrency for $40,000 with leverage on the margin
    account, you will lose all your personal money ($10,000) when the asset falls

    of 1:4 and want to trade not for the $10,000 you have but for $40,000, then you
    will pay a higher interest. It can reach 1% -2% per day. In the case we’re considering,
    the interest accrues for $30,000\. I remind you that you actually only have $10,000.

    than 10% of loss in a position. That is your limit. However, technical analysis

    use technical analysis as it is simple enough to determine the entry/exit points.
