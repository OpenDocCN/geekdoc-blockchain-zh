- en: There is more value to the blockchain-enabled technology other than top-notch
    security. For instance, individuals can transact or communicate via secure channels.
    Transactions don’t go through intermediaries and hence simpler and faster than
    those run by centralized entities. Colleges, universities, hospitals, and financial
    firms are a few of the institutions expected to leverage the pros of this technology.

    an important question that if answered could lead to many people adopting cryptocurrencies
    and its underlying blockchain technology. UBIQUICOIN is one of the crypto companies

    prices dropping in massive scales. Even Bitcoin wasn’t spared, either. Despite
    these unfortunate circumstances, huge companies such as Amazon and Facebook are
    said to be interested in adopting the blockchain technology. TraDove is a Francisco—based
    B2B company that raised millions in ICO pre-sales to help them move their services
    onto the blockchain for secure and faster transactions.

    accepting payment in form of cryptocurrencies. The number of companies accepting
    this medium is expected to grow. Actually, any enterprise that won’t be accepting

    Some of the companies leveraging the benefits of this technology include JoyToken
    (gaming platform) and meVu, a betting platform with an aim to make betting less
    expensive. Towards the end of 2018, smart contracts will have taken over from
    signed paper contracts and other expensive escrow services we are using at the
    moment.

    cutting out intermediaries who make education costly.
