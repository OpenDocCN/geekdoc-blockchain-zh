    the first native digital medium for value. Our research at the Blockchain Research
    Institute continues to look beyond the enterprise and the industry, to understand
    how blockchain will transform the economy and society at large. The financial
    services sector is a key lever in such transformation. Blockchain-based applications
    such as digital identities and smart wallets running in a trust-minimized manner
    on mobile devices will enable over a billion people to participate in the global
    economy.

    financial markets. In Chapter 1, we explore the nine major disruptions to our
    global financial system in the areas of identity verification and compliance with
    know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations; checking and value transfer
    services; savings and deposits; loans and credit accounts; trading and exchanges;
    venture capital and securities markets; insurance and risk management; financial
    analysis; and accounting and financial reporting. It’s quite a list!

    of its original 28 backers have dropped out of the project—Mastercard, PayPal,
    and Visa among them—the project has the support of the Bank of England Governor,
    Mark Carney. He said that Britain must face up to the problems of its payments
    system. “In this day and age, those payments should be instantaneous, it should
    be the same as us exchanging a bank note online,” he said. “It should be instantaneous,
    it should be virtually costless, and it should be 100 percent resilient.”¹ We
    consider how the other FAANG companies—that is, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix, and
    Google—might respond with their own digital tokens. The chapter provides direction
    for incumbents, innovators, and central bankers alike. Finally, we preview the
    world of financial services in the year 2030, so that readers get a clear sense
    of the unintended consequences of going it alone in financial services and the
    potential costs of doing nothing now.

    such as bitcoin represents digital scarcity—finite, immutable, not copiable—in
    a global financial system where digital goods tend to be abundant, duplicative,
    and adaptable. What’s more, tokens as programmable money could potentially automate
    internal governance over our common resources. As Michael writes, “It’s money
    with a dynamic use”—not just a unit of exchange but also a direct means of achieving
    community objectives, a completely new approach to managing our increasingly digitized
    economy. With scarce digital tokens, communities with a common interest in value
    generation can embed their shared values into these tokens and use them as instruments
    of those values.

    and incentives” are far-reaching. A chasm has emerged between those who see a
    game-changing shift, not simply in fundraising activity or economic strategy but
    also in mitigating the tragedy of the commons, and those who warn of reckless
    initial coin offering (ICO) scams and an impending regulatory crackdown. Everyone
    should read Michael’s lucid chapter and participate in the debate.

    of blockchain-based systems, some of which qualify as ecosystems, such as Bitcoin
    and Ethereum, and some, as decentralized applications. While the ICO addresses
    the weaknesses of the initial public offering (IPO), it presents its own challenges,
    highlighted by some high-profile swindles that WIRED magazine called “straight-up
    trolling.” Among them was Prodeum, which appeared on a Thursday, raised barely
    any money, and disappeared by the following Monday, along with its website, its
    press release, and its social media accounts.² Hacking is also a problem. The
    professional services firm Ernst & Young analyzed more than 300 ICOs and determined
    that roughly 10 percent ($400m) of the $3.7 billion raised had been siphoned off,
    with phishers nicking as much as $1.5 million a month.³

    and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its equivalents in other jurisdictions are gauging
    the level of regulatory oversight required to balance the viability of blockchain
    start-ups with the risk to investors, especially retail investors caught up in
    the hype. The chapter’s all-star team of researchers—Fennie Wang, Primavera De
    Filippi, Alexis Collomb, and Klara Sok of Coalition of Automated Legal Applications
    (COALA)—deftly describes various legal solutions that could support ecosystems
    that are innovative and streamlined, yet fair for all stakeholders. It is among
    the most thoughtful and definitive studies to date.

    improve international clearance and settlement by replacing layers of complex
    systems for communicating with each other and adding fees and delays at each step
    of the payment process. With blockchain technology, proven mathematics instead
    of fallible or sometimes corrupt human beings will bolster users’ trust in the
    system by providing a much-needed single version of the truth. In addition, dramatically
    reduced fees, micropayment capability, and mobile infrastructure will help a billion
    unbanked people to participate in the global economy. Bob details how our current
    payment system evolved, and what we can do to transform it for the digital economy.
    Blockchain start-ups are disrupting the banking industry’s arcane procedures with
    distributed ledger technology. The incumbent powers may be slow to embrace blockchain;
    according to Bob, if they resist change, then they may find themselves without
    a role in the global economy. It’s a powerful message.

    store, and manage information (not necessarily financial), with a deep dive into
    government use cases, though the same fundamental principles apply entirely to
    financial services. More than ever, engaged citizens expect to be heard and informed—indeed,
    to be active collaborators rather than passive recipients. They expect elected
    officials to spend tax funds wisely. Blockchain technology makes these goals easier
    to accomplish. In this chapter, Anthony Williams focuses on ways to simplify and
    improve government services through a single digital ledger for all government
    accounts. He assesses Canada’s current general ledger system, compares it with
    best practices in places like Estonia and Sweden, and presents a possible blockchain-based
    solution. The analysis is not cheerleading; Anthony lays out the relevant challenges
    and implementation costs, including managing risk and connecting with existing
    policies and procedures.](chapter0087.html)'

    Louis D. Brandeis, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” Transparency
    is critical to the robust functioning of markets, corporations, and governments.
    Consider the murkiness of Enron’s balance sheet and the opacity of the US subprime
    mortgage market: the former contributed to the largest corporate failure ever
    at the time, the closure of a storied accounting firm with 85,000 jobs lost, and
    the convictions of several C-suite executives; and the latter factored into the
    2008 market crash. Today trillions of dollars of underfunded derivatives—and some
    experts peg that amount much higher—threaten to trigger an economic crash that
    would make 2008 look like a tremor.'

    it makes such obfuscation more difficult, if not impossible. For starters, two
    people cannot claim ownership of the same asset—the ledger will not allow it.
    That reminds me of the next part of Justice Brandeis’ quote: “Electric light [is]
    the most efficient policeman.”⁴ The chapter’s author Andreas Park is a finance
    professor at the Rotman School of Management. He studies equity markets and advises
    regulatory bodies on the economic impact of technology within the financial industries.
    In this final chapter, he demonstrates that transparency is a design choice and
    argues for public disclosure even on permissioned blockchains. His is a compelling
    argument, and one well worth considering for those weighing their public/private
    blockchain design options.'

- en: As you can see, this book is a preview of the fast approaching future of financial
    services, markets, and money. It is a global industry ripe for disruption, and
    blockchain start-ups around the world are targeting every aspect of it. Time has
    become the scarce commodity. Nobel laureate Robert Schiller observed, “Hesitation
    is often like procrastination. One may have vague doubts and feel a need to mull
    things over; meanwhile, other issues intrude on thought, and no decision is taken.”⁵
    There are ideas and opportunities here for every forward-looking leader to act
    on now.
