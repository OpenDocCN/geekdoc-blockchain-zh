- en: Mining is a foundational concept in understanding how the Bitcoin protocol operates.
    It refers to a decentralized review process performed on each block of the blockchain
    to reach consensus without the need for a central authority to provide trust.
    In other words, mining is the computational equivalent of peer review in a decentralized
    environment where neither party involved trusts the other. We continue our discussion
    of a hash-function explained in Chapter [1](A430562_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml) as it
    refers to mining and solving PoW functions. Then, we integrate the concepts of
    block target values and network difficulty with mining and how mining has evolved
    to keep up with the increasing difficulty. This will lead us further into talking
    about the types of hardware mining that have recently been developed. We end the
    chapter with an analysis of startups that began selling dedicated hardware for
    mining, leading to the Bitcoin mining arms race and their eventual failure.

    new bitcoins to the money supply and verifying transactions. In this chapter,
    we look at the mechanisms behind these two processes. Essentially, mining is the
    appropriate solution to the double spending problem we discussed previously. To
    remove the need for a central authority, individuals running the Bitcoin client
    on their own machines (called miners) participate in the network and verify that
    transactions taking place between two parties are not fraudulent. Mining is actually
    a computationally intensive activity, but what incentives does anyone have to
    help mine for new Bitcoins? The key incentive for miners is getting a reward in
    the form of Bitcoins for their participation. Let’s look at a simplified view
    of the mining process in Figure [2-1](#Fig1).![A430562_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    2-1.A simplified overview of the mining processUnpackaged transactions that have
    recently occurred in the Bitcoin network remain in the transaction pool until
    they are picked up by a miner to be packaged into a block. A miner selects transactions
    from the transaction pool to package them in a block. After the block has been
    created, it needs a header before it can be accepted by the blockchain. Think
    of this as shipping a package: Once the package has been created, it needs to
    be stamped so that it can be shipped. A miner uses the header of the most recent
    block in the blockchain to construct a new header for this current block. The
    block header also contains other elements such as a timestamp, version of the
    Bitcoin client, and an ID corresponding to the previous block in the chain. The
    resulting block is called a candidate block, and it can now be added to the blockchain
    if a few other conditions are satisfied.The process of mining is very involved
    and Figure [2-1](#Fig1) only serves to paint a broad picture regarding the participation
    of miners in the protocol. Next, we explore the technical aspects of the stamp
    (analogy referenced earlier) and the mechanism of stamping a package. Keep in
    mind that mining is a competitive process: Figure [2-1](#Fig1) describes this
    process for only one miner, but in reality, a very large number of miners participate
    in the network. The miners compete with each other to find a stamp for the package
    (block) they created, and the first miner to discover the stamp wins. The race
    between miners to find a stamp is concluded within ten minutes, and a new race
    begins in the next ten minutes. Once the stamp is discovered, the miner can complete
    the block and announce it to the network, and then it can be added to the blockchain.
    Let’s take a look at the process behind searching for the stamp, better known
    as a block-header , in Figure [2-2](#Fig2).![A430562_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    2-2.Generating a block header by solving proof of work (PoW)The package created
    by a miner is almost a block, but it is missing a header. It’s called a candidate
    block and it can only be added to the blockchain after the stamp, or the header,
    is added. The header from the most recent block in the blockchain is retrieved
    and combined with a 32-bit value called nonce. This combination is directed to
    the hash function (SHA-256) as an input. The hash function computes a new resulting
    hash as an output. This generated hash is then compared to the target value of
    the network (at the given time). If the hash value is larger than the target value,
    then the nonce is readjusted and a new input is sent to the hash function to obtain
    a new potential output. The problem of finding the appropriate hash value that
    is smaller than the target value is at the heart of PoW, and it can only be solved
    using brute force. Once a hash value smaller than the target value is discovered
    by a miner, this hash can then be used in the block header for the candidate block.
    The first miner to discover the hash is considered to be the winner. The winning
    miner has shown PoW that she did to discover the hash, so the transactions contained
    within the block are now considered valid. This block can now be added to the
    blockchain. Additionally, the winning miner also earns the reward for solving
    the PoW problem , which is a certain number of Bitcoins. This whole process from
    packaging transactions into a block, to finding the hash and announcing the block
    to the Bitcoin network repeats itself approximately every ten minutes.We introduced
    some new terminology in Figure [2-2](#Fig2), so let’s describe the terms here
    properly for the sake of completion.'

    works, let’s take a look at mining difficulty and target values. Those two concepts
    are analogous to dials or knobs that can be adjusted over the course of time for
    the network and all Bitcoin clients update to follow the latest values. So what
    is mining difficulty? Essentially, it can be defined as the difficulty of finding
    a hash below the target value as a miner is solving the PoW problem. An increase
    in difficulty corresponds to longer time needed to discover the hash and solve
    PoW , also known as mining time. The ideal mining time is set by the network to
    be approximately ten minutes, which implies that a new block is announced on the
    network every ten minutes. The mining time is dependent on three factors: the
    target value, the number of miners in the network, and mining difficulty. Let’s

    PoW 问题时找到低于目标值的哈希的难度。难度增加意味着需要更长的时间来发现哈希并解决 PoW，也被称为挖矿时间。网络设置的理想挖矿时间约为十分钟，这意味着每十分钟在网络上宣布一个新的区块。挖矿时间取决于三个因素：目标值、网络中的矿工数量和挖矿难度。让我们看看这些因素是如何相互关联的。

    2-3.Solving the PoW problemMiners across the network compete to solve the problem
    and the winning miner announces the block to the network, which then gets incorporated
    in the blockchain. To solve the PoW, a miner has to keep generating new hash values
    (through the hash function) using the incremented nonce until a hash that is below
    the target value is discovered. In this case, notice that the nonce is the only
    adjustable value. This is a simplified PoW scheme and there are small differences
    in its implementation.NoteThe term mining is used because the process is similar
    to the mining of rare metals. It is very resource intensive and it makes new currency
    avaliable at a slow rate, just like the miners in the Bitcoin protocol getting
    rewarded.We talked about the self-correction properties in Bitcoin network and
    how they allow the network to adapt. Next, we take a look at an unexpected case
    of having a very large number of miners in the network as Bitcoin gained popularity.
    This led to an arms race of sorts and it had far-reaching consequences. First,
    though, we need to talk about the new types of mining hardware that emerged.

    2-3. 解决 PoW 问题网络中的矿工竞争解决问题，获胜的矿工宣布区块加入网络，然后被纳入区块链。为了解决 PoW，矿工必须不断生成新的哈希值（通过哈希函数）使用增加的随机数，直到发现一个低于目标值的哈希值。在这种情况下，请注意随机数是唯一可以调整的值。这是一个简化的
    PoW 方案，其实现方式有细微差别。注释术语“挖矿”是因为这个过程类似于挖掘稀有金属。这是一个非常资源密集型的过程，并且它以很慢的速度提供新货币，就像比特币协议中的矿工一样获得奖励。我们讨论了比特币网络中的自我纠正特性，以及它们如何使网络适应。接下来，我们将看看一个意想不到的情况，即随着比特币的普及，网络中出现了大量矿工。这导致了一种类似军备竞赛的情况，并产生了深远的影响。但首先，我们需要谈论出现的新型挖矿硬件。

    hardware, as developers were designing new chips and buying new equpiment for
    mining rigs that allow them to mine the most Bitcoin. This initial push, driven
    by profit, accelerated Bitcoin’s reach and created a golden era for the alternative
    currency. More developers and enthusiasts joined in, buying custom hardware to
    maximize their profits. The network responded by increasing the difficulty as
    the number of miners increased. Within a short time span, the bubble could not
    sustain itself for the miners due to the self-correcting features present in the
    protocol and the difficulty kept rising. In some cases, the hardware that miners
    purchased could no longer mine profitably by the time it arrived from the factory.
    A significant capital investment was required up front to achieve any appreciable
    returns. Most of the ASICs hardware is now historic, and even Bitcoin mining pools
    are not profitable for the average miner. The startups and companies that commercialized
    ASICs and custom hardware made a decent short-term profit and then flopped. We

    between mid-2013 and late 2014\. The startups covered here followed the strategy
    of selling pickaxes to make profits, but some took it a step further. The first
    startup we discuss is Butterfly Labs. This company out of Missouri came about
    in late 2011 with the promise of selling technology that was capable of mining
    Bitcoin leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Their ASICs were supposedly
    able to mine Bitcoin 1,000 times faster, and they opened up for preorders soon
    after the initial announcement in 2012\. Miners flocked to purchase the hardware,
    which was promised for delivery by December of the same year. Butterfly Labs collected
    somewhere between $20 million and $30 million in preorders as reported by the
    Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Shipments started to roll out to only a few customers
    around April 2013, but most customers did not receive their mining equipment for
    another year. When the customers did recieve their machines, they were obsolete,
    and some accused Butterfly Labs of using the hardware to mine for themselves before
    delivering them. Despite being unable to follow through with their initial orders,
    Butterfly Labs began offering a new and much more powerful miner and opened preorders
    for that new miner. Ultimately, the company became one of the most hated in the
    Bitcoin community, and the FTC had to step in to shut it down.The second company
    we discuss, CoinTerra, is a more complicated case because the startup was founded
    by a team that had deep expertise in the field. The CEO, Ravi, was a CPU architect
    at Samsung previously, and the company’s board included many other leaders in
    the field. Initially, they were venture backed and well funded, and in 2013, they
    announced their first product, TerraMiner IV, which was supposed to be shipped
    in December of the same year. The company could not ship the product in time and
    eventually pushed the date back. The miner still did not arrive in 2014 and eventually
    CoinTerra apologized to customers, offering them some compensation, which was
    also largely delayed, frustrating customers even further. It seems that the company
    is trying to pivot to cloud mining services, but most of its customer base has
    already lost their trust.The final case focuses on a startup called HashFast.
    Similar to previous two examples, HashFast was offering miners called Baby Jet
    that would be delivered in December 2013\. The team at HashFast overpromised the
    features and underdelivered at a time when difficulty skyrocketed. It is likely
    that the company took the cash from early adopters to fund its own development,
    and when they encountered difficulties, the customers demanded refunds for their
    orders. The problem at the time was that the price of Bitcoin increased steadily,
    so the company did not have enough funds to pay back the customers. They were
    facing multiple lawsuits and running out of cash reserves very fast. Eventually,
    a judge allowed the auctioning of all assets that the company owned to pay back
    the creditors and investors. A common theme these companies share is that they
    were frequently unable to deliver mining hardware on the promised timeline and
    significantly delayed or refused to issue any refunds to their customers.We can
    construct a general scheme of operations from the cases presented here and other
    ASICs startups that failed similarly to Butterfly Labs:'

  zh: 在本节中，我们重点介绍了比特币黄金热时期（2013年中至2014年末）的一些故事。这里涵盖的初创公司遵循了出售镐头以获利的策略，但有些公司走得更远。我们讨论的第一家初创公司是Butterfly
    Labs。这家总部位于密苏里州的公司于2011年末成立，承诺销售能够比竞争对手快跃进数倍的挖矿技术。据联邦贸易委员会（FTC）报道，他们的ASIC据说能够比特币挖矿快1000倍，并在2012年初公布后不久就开始接受预购。矿工们蜂拥购买承诺在同年12月交付的硬件。Butterfly
    Labs据FTC报告，收集了约2000万至3000万美元的预购款项。在2013年4月左右，开始向少数客户发货，但大多数客户在另一年才收到他们的挖矿设备。当客户收到机器时，它们已经过时，有人指责Butterfly
    Labs在交付之前使用硬件进行挖矿。尽管无法完成最初的订单，Butterfly Labs开始提供一款新且更强大的矿工，并为该新矿工开放了预购。最终，该公司成为比特币社区中最受憎恶的公司之一，FTC不得不介入关闭它。我们讨论的第二家公司是CoinTerra，这是一个更为复杂的案例，因为该初创公司由一个在该领域拥有深厚专业知识的团队创立。首席执行官拉维（Ravi）曾是三星的CPU架构师，公司董事会还包括该领域的许多其他领导者。最初，他们得到了风险投资支持和资金充足，在2013年，他们宣布了他们的第一款产品TerraMiner
    IV，应该在同年12月发货。公司未能及时发货，并最终推迟了日期。到2014年，矿工仍未到货，最终CoinTerra向客户道歉，提供了一些补偿，但也大大延迟，进一步激怒了客户。看起来公司正试图转向云挖矿服务，但大部分客户已经失去了信任。最后一个案例集中在一家名为HashFast的初创公司。与前两个例子类似，HashFast提供了称为Baby
    Jet的矿工，将于2013年12月交付。HashFast团队在困难激增时过度承诺功能并未兑现。当时的问题是比特币价格稳步上涨，因此公司没有足够的资金偿还客户。他们面临多起诉讼，并迅速耗尽现金储备。最终，法官允许拍卖公司拥有的所有资产以偿还债权人和投资者。这些公司共享的一个共同主题是，它们经常无法按照承诺的时间表交付挖矿硬件，并严重延迟或拒绝向客户退款。我们可以从这里呈现的案例和其他类似于Butterfly
    Labs失败的ASIC初创公司构建一个一般的运营方案：

  zh: 新共识
- en: 'We conclude this chapter by talking about the same theme that we started it
    with: consensus. This chapter’s central idea was that in Bitcoin, mining is used
    to reach consensus to prevent users from double spending and validate all the
    transactions. However, since the advent of Bitcoin, other consensus algorithms
    have been developed. We refer to the PoW algorithm referenced in the original
    Bitcoin protocol for reaching consensus as the Nakamoto Consensus. A new consensus
    algorithm that has recently become popular is known as proof of stake (PoS), where
    the participants essentially play the role of validators. In Bitcoin, bad actors
    with fraudulent transactions have to face a rigorous approval process and validation
    from the network of miners. In PoS, the participants have a stake in the network
    (hence the name) in the form of currency. As such, they want to see the network
    succeed and trust emerges in blocks that have the largest stake of currency invested
    by the validators. Additionally, the malicious validators will get their stake
    slashed for acting in bad faith. We dive into the technical aspects of PoS, and
    how it compares to the mechanism of PoW, later in the book. Our journey ends in
    this chapter with consensus and we pick up our discussion on the Bitcoin network
    and the blockchain in the next chapter.'

  zh: 我们通过讨论相同主题来结束本章：共识。本章的核心思想是，在比特币中，挖矿用于达成共识，以防止用户双重花费并验证所有交易。然而，自比特币问世以来，其他共识算法也得到了发展。我们将原始比特币协议中用于达成共识的PoW算法称为中本聪共识。一种最近变得流行的新共识算法被称为权益证明（PoS），其中参与者基本上扮演验证者的角色。在比特币中，有欺诈交易的不良行为者必须经受来自矿工网络的严格批准和验证。在PoS中，参与者通过货币形式在网络中拥有利益（因此得名），因此他们希望网络成功，并且信任建立在验证者投资的货币中拥有最大股份的区块上。此外，恶意验证者将因为恶意行为而被削减他们的利益。我们将在本书后面深入探讨PoS的技术方面，以及它与PoW机制的比较。我们在本章中以共识结束我们的旅程，并在下一章中继续讨论比特币网络和区块链。

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we talked about the concept of mining and presented the technical
    background necessary to understand how miners verify blocks. We discussed in depth
    the backbone of mining in Bitcoin called PoW, and throughout the remainder of
    the book, we present other consensus mechanisms. Then, we described the arms race
    in Bitcoin mining over producing the best hardware, which led to the huge rise
    in difficulty, and the startup failures that resulted from that time period. Finally,
    we ended the chapter with a mention of PoS, which we return to in a later chapter.
