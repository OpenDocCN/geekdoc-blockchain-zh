    (within their clouds titled Azure and Bluemix, respectively). These private networks
    pose considerable issues about their experimental nature, as it is not yet clear
    how these attempts will be affected by the scale and operation of the exercise
    in relation to its infrastructure. Nonetheless, the potential is already apparent.
