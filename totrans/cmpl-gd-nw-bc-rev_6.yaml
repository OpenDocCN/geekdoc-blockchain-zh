- en: Both Microsoft and IBM have recently released private Blockchain service technologies
    (within their clouds titled Azure and Bluemix, respectively). These private networks
    pose considerable issues about their experimental nature, as it is not yet clear
    how these attempts will be affected by the scale and operation of the exercise
    in relation to its infrastructure. Nonetheless, the potential is already apparent.

    developments in the works. Understanding how it will be implemented as a service
    reveals the key to understand the future applications that are being considered
    now, even though the technology is not yet far enough advanced to make these concepts
    into reality just yet.

    in Blockchain technology. Players from the finance sector have already put almost
    $1 billion toward companies that are working to further develop Blockchain technology.
    It is projected that $20 billion could be saved yearly with the successful implementation

    and JPMorgan are just a few of the big names involved in providing assets to further
    develop the technology. What are they researching? With the funds they’ve invested,
    these companies will be able to explore how Blockchain technology can be commercialized
    to handle the trade of stocks, bonds, loans, derivatives and other assets. At
    this time, those transactions are recorded and stored by central banks and other
    institutions. This process is costly and takes a lot of time.

    security. Both within companies and between them, programs for transactions are
    being piloted so that banks can securely make faster, safer exchanges. These kinds
    of transactions differ from the ones practiced through the Bitcoin Blockchain
    because they are private rather than public, which means there may be an authority
    overseeing the transactions. Already this year, successful tests have been conducted
    and Nasdaq successfully carried out a securities transaction using its own Blockchain
    exchange.

    to trace the ownership of an item to determine whether they are of illegal or
    false provenance. Insurance companies are finding themselves drawn into cybersecurity
    issues, and one is already working with a Blockchain startup to begin tracking
    diamonds as they leave mines to trace their movements.

    recorded and ascribed to a serial number that has been assigned to the item. The
    serial number can, in some cases, be inscribed directly on the item. That information
    then enters the Blockchain database; it cannot be stolen or corrupted because
    it is replicated on every node and encrypted. This kind of system would allow
    the provenance of each item to be certified by sellers and give buyers a way to
    find out about the items they are seeking to purchase. This also gives the police
    and other authorities a resource to use when seeking items that have been stolen.'

    to industries where the data being transmitted must be protected, such as the
    transaction of medical records. The healthcare system has long lagged and been
    held back by inefficient practices that must be imposed to keep patient identities
    safe. That’s why health care industries are showing interest in the potential
    of Blockchain. For pharmaceutical companies, the draw lies in the potential to
    track and tag drugs to regulate the trade of goods to prevent illegal trade and
    counterfeiting.

    of privacy. There are projects underway that are investigating the potential for
    people to have the power to store their own personal data on a secure and private
    server. This would empower them to have control over who accesses it. The following
    scenario would then be possible: when a call for research is made, individuals
    would have the power to sell or allow access to their data for researchers to
    use. Data is then utilized as an asset and something you own and can be compensated
    for rather than just giving it away for free.'

    businesses but also has the potential to destroy other forms. New types of policies
    could be invented; for example, with the 24-availability of Blockchain technology,
    you could get insurance on the weekends, even after company hours. With real-time
    updates to the database, you could have the option of insurance over a mere period
    of hours. This would mean making longer-term forms of accident insurance less
    popular, which could cut into profits.

    downloading. What if there were a way to make music available online secure, yet
    convenient to access on the web? Blockchain has the potential to change the way
    the music business deals with royalty costs. Everyone knows the music business

    a Blockchain, they would be able to capitalize on collection of royalties in a
    way no platform has ever been able to guarantee its artist’s before. Instead of
    having the music encoded on a file as with MP3s, a new type of file would be used.
    MP3s can carry meta-data, but the amount is not significant and it can be easily
    removed and passed on further without the ability to trace it. This new type of
    file would be one that plays music as well as wears the Blockchain data on intellectual
    property rights and requirements for payment.

    contracts, deeds and titles more secure and trackable than ever before. This is
    particularly useful for instances where this information is at a risk for loss.
    Imagine the dangers posed in the face of the loss of a paper archive, for example,
    in a war-torn environment. With an updated record distributed across multiple
    platforms, the risk of this loss is avoided and can be better maintained.

    property of businesses, both small and large. 3D Printing, as mentioned above,
    can be risky in terms of transferring data. This applies to other goods as well.
    Particularly for smaller companies, the task of protecting the IP of their products
    is high challenging when they are also trying to operate on a platform to sell
    their wares. Using Blockchain, people who hold rights on their creations have
    a platform to store metadata on actual substances, thereby ensuring the safety
    of their wares.

    data. Consider platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Every time you interact
    with information through these platforms, you are creating data that is then controlled
    by those companies and sold off to other parties to design marketing targeting
    your tastes. This is an example of companies having ownership off your own data,
    data that you have created.

    by you personally and selectively released at your discretion rather than available
    in the ownership of the companies. This ties into the concept of Internet of Things,
    because with the implementation of identity-protecting Blockchain technology,
    you can have control over who has access to what aspects of your identity. Combined
    with smart contracts, you will have opportunities to authorize and more effectively
    manage the collection of data on your identity. A new era of privacy is ushered
    in with the development of Blockchain.
