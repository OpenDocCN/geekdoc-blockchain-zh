- en: Today’s financial transactions are complex and costly. These are prone to human
    error and even fraud as each participant has their own separate ledgers. Intermediaries
    are also needed for validation that causes inefficiencies; and there are often
    delays and monitory losses. However, with the emergence of the Blockchain Technology,
    also known as Distributed Ledger Technology, it has been recognised that this
    new technology can provide highly efficient solutions to some of the issues with
    financial transactions that currently exist, especially when transactions involve
    cryptocurrencies.

- en: 'Blockchain (BC) seems complicated, and it certainly can be, but its core concept
    is quite simple. A Blockchain is a particular type of database: a data structure
    that consists of a growing list of data records, called blocks, that are linked
    together using cryptography. It is an open and decentralised ledger that can record
    transactions between participants across a peer-to-peer network, without the need
    for a central certifying authority. Formally, as per the definition by McKinsey
    in Garson (2018), Blockchain is a decentralised, shared, and trusted distributed
    ledger (or database) that consists of encrypted ‘blocks’ of information added
    to a chain of existing blocks of linked records. The World Economic Forum estimate
    that by 2025, at least 10% of the world’s GDP, currently at USD 100 trillion,
    will be managed via the Blockchain technology (Hance, 2020). According to Yahoo
    Finance (2020), the Blockchain market size is expected to grow from USD 3.0 billion
    in 2020 to USD 39.7 billion by 2025\.'

- en: Blockchain technology is highly attractive due to the numerous advantages that
    it offers including increased transparency, reduced transaction costs, faster
    transaction settlement, automation of information, increased traceability, improved
    customer experience, improved digital identity, better cyber security, and user-controlled
    networks in real time. Potential applications and use cases include funds transfer,
    smart contracts, e-voting, efficient supply chain management, and financial transactions
    using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin; covering nearly every sector of the society
    including finance, healthcare, law, trade, real estate, and many more. As is always
    the case, challenges and limitations also exist due to the newness of this technology
    but mainly due to lack of adequate regulations and controls. The inherent issues
    include high energy consumption, limited scalability, complexity, security, network
    size, and lack of regulations; and also, unethical and illegal activities such
    as money laundering and avoidance of tax. Nevertheless, Blockchain is an attractive
    technology, and has much to offer to the modern-day industry.
