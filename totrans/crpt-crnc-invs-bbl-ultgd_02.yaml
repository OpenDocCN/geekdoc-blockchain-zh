- en: The entire banking system of our days, regardless of the country, is arranged
    in such a way that we do not own our money. Central banks in any state hold emission
    monopoly, which is provided through legislation, creating a sure stumbling block
    to cryptocurrency legalization.

  zh: 当今整个银行体系，无论哪个国家，都是如此安排，以至于我们并不拥有自己的钱。任何国家的中央银行都拥有货币发行垄断权，这是通过立法提供的，为加密货币合法化制造了一个确定的绊脚石。
- en: Fiat money is a term used by the cryptocurrency community to designate a currency without intrinsic
    value as money by government regulation or law (dollar, euro, etc.).

  zh: 法定货币是加密货币社区用来指代没有内在货币价值的货币，这种货币是由政府规定或法律（美元、欧元等）所指定的。
- en: In theory, this currency should be secured by at least those goods, products,
    or services that are produced in the territory of a particular country (GDP) so
    that every citizen of this country can change their personal money for products.
    All the banks of the country also undertake the same currency, and the central
    bank promises to maintain its stability and reliability. This is how it works
    in theory, but no one can actually guarantee the currency’s stability.

  zh: 在理论上，这种货币应该至少由那些在一个国家领土内生产的产品、商品或服务来支持，以便这个国家的每个公民都可以用他们的个人货币兑换产品。一个国家的所有银行也承担同样的货币，中央银行承诺维持其稳定性和可靠性。这就是它在理论上的运作方式，但没有人能真正保证货币的稳定性。
- en: The government of a country is the main customer of all goods and services for
    the population, i.e. one of the largest employers. It is also the largest customer
    for the construction of roads, houses, hospitals, schools, etc. This makes up
    the lion's share of the GDP of each particular country. Accordingly, the government
    ensures the life of the population – pays pensions and social benefits. All these
    funds are taken from the central bank, which can issue currency and finance the
    government.

  zh: 一个国家的政府是所有商品和服务的最大客户，即最大的雇主之一。它也是道路、房屋、医院、学校等建设的最大客户。这构成了每个国家GDP的大部分。相应地，政府确保人口的生活——支付养老金和社会福利。所有这些资金都来自中央银行，后者可以发行货币并资助政府。
- en: A policy dubbed [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing)
    was once implemented in the USA and later even spread to Europe and Japan. Due
    to this phenomenon, the amount of money in the world has greatly increased, while
    the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased over the past 100 years by 95%.
    This trend is ongoing. The more money exists, the cheaper it becomes.

- en: It is important to keep in mind that each kind of currency experiences inflation,
    which indicates the depreciation of currency over some time. In other words, inflation
    is the speed of money circulation. The country's economy has its own cycles as
    people take on loans and then pay them back.

  zh: 重要的是要记住，每种货币都会经历通货膨胀，这表明货币在一段时间内的贬值。换句话说，通货膨胀是货币流通的速度。一个国家的经济有自己的周期，因为人们承担贷款然后偿还。
- en: I cannot help but mention these loans. In the USA, the loan interest rates are
    at an average of 1%. They remained at zero level for a long time in the past.
    The central banks issued money and bought up financial assets, and accordingly,
    the poor people remained poor, and those people who had financial assets, stocks,
    or real estate made a constant profit. That is why each crisis makes the poor
    even poorer and the rich even richer. These processes result in a very powerful
    stratification of the population. However, alas, the economy works in this way,
    and we approach a kind of dead end, as many financial analysts state. All of this
    to demonstrate that the central banks do not cope very well with their function.

  zh: 我忍不住要提到这些贷款。在美国，贷款利率平均为1%。过去很长一段时间内，它们保持在零水平。中央银行发行货币并购买金融资产，因此，穷人依然贫穷，而那些拥有金融资产、股票或房地产的人则不断获利。这就是为什么每次危机都使穷人更穷，富人更富。这些过程导致了人口非常强大的分层。然而，遗憾的是，经济就是以这种方式运作的，正如许多金融分析师所说，我们正走向某种死胡同。这一切都说明中央银行并没有很好地履行其职能。
- en: So people started to look for an alternative way to preserve the value of money.
    If not to multiply, at least not to lose. That’s why many people invest in gold,
    fixed income instruments, shares, etc. At the same time, the economy began to
    develop swiftly after the Internet appeared, so people realized they do not need
    to hold money in physical form now. Thus, the concept of electronic money emerged.

    there is a difference between Bitcoin and other types of digital money. If you
    use such electronic money systems as PayPal, Western Union, or Skrill, your finances
    are stored in the same companies. In this case, we deal with centralized money
    management, i.e. the fate of your money depends on decisions of specific people
    in these companies. You have no power to influence these decisions.

    of Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin and created its original reference implementation.
    He released the first Bitcoin software that launched the network and the first
    units of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Bitcoin became a new type of digital currency,
    which was very different from all the others. Its main difference lies in the
    fact that it is decentralized. Therefore, each participant cannot influence its

  zh: 在2008年全球金融危机的背景下，一个名叫中本聪的人设计并创建了比特币的原始参考实现。他发布了第一个比特币软件，启动了网络，并产生了第一个比特币加密货币单位。比特币成为了一种新的数字货币，与所有其他货币非常不同。它最主要的区别在于它是去中心化的。因此，每个参与者都无法影响它的命运。
- en: The following question arises. There are a lot of people on the network, they
    do not know each other, and it's logical that they do not trust each other. So
    how can they be sure that payments are carried out and their money will not be
    stolen? However, everything was thought out in advance by Satoshi Nakamoto and
    carefully described by me in the book Mastering Bitcoin for Starters. Suffice
    it to say that Nakamoto’s vision for a decentralized currency held true, solving

    Nakamoto）早已预见了一切，并在我撰写的《比特币入门精通》一书中详细阐述。只需说 Nakamoto 对去中心化货币的愿景得以实现，解决了许多问题。
- en: By the way, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is still shrouded in mystery. Several
    attempts have been made to disclose it because some people believe that Satoshi
    Nakamoto is a group of people rather than one person. However, none of these attempts
