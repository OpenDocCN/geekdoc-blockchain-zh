    in such a way that we do not own our money. Central banks in any state hold emission
    monopoly, which is provided through legislation, creating a sure stumbling block
    to cryptocurrency legalization.

    value as money by government regulation or law (dollar, euro, etc.).

    or services that are produced in the territory of a particular country (GDP) so
    that every citizen of this country can change their personal money for products.
    All the banks of the country also undertake the same currency, and the central
    bank promises to maintain its stability and reliability. This is how it works
    in theory, but no one can actually guarantee the currency’s stability.

    the population, i.e. one of the largest employers. It is also the largest customer
    for the construction of roads, houses, hospitals, schools, etc. This makes up
    the lion's share of the GDP of each particular country. Accordingly, the government
    ensures the life of the population – pays pensions and social benefits. All these
    funds are taken from the central bank, which can issue currency and finance the
    government.

    was once implemented in the USA and later even spread to Europe and Japan. Due
    to this phenomenon, the amount of money in the world has greatly increased, while
    the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased over the past 100 years by 95%.
    This trend is ongoing. The more money exists, the cheaper it becomes.

    which indicates the depreciation of currency over some time. In other words, inflation
    is the speed of money circulation. The country's economy has its own cycles as
    people take on loans and then pay them back.

    at an average of 1%. They remained at zero level for a long time in the past.
    The central banks issued money and bought up financial assets, and accordingly,
    the poor people remained poor, and those people who had financial assets, stocks,
    or real estate made a constant profit. That is why each crisis makes the poor
    even poorer and the rich even richer. These processes result in a very powerful
    stratification of the population. However, alas, the economy works in this way,
    and we approach a kind of dead end, as many financial analysts state. All of this
    to demonstrate that the central banks do not cope very well with their function.

    If not to multiply, at least not to lose. That’s why many people invest in gold,
    fixed income instruments, shares, etc. At the same time, the economy began to
    develop swiftly after the Internet appeared, so people realized they do not need
    to hold money in physical form now. Thus, the concept of electronic money emerged.

- en: The idea of creating a digital currency like Bitcoin is not entirely new. Still,
    there is a difference between Bitcoin and other types of digital money. If you
    use such electronic money systems as PayPal, Western Union, or Skrill, your finances
    are stored in the same companies. In this case, we deal with centralized money
    management, i.e. the fate of your money depends on decisions of specific people
    in these companies. You have no power to influence these decisions.

    by the independence from a single transaction processing center. It is very difficult
    to track cryptocurrency transactions and impossible to cancel them. Using this
    type of currency, two people can carry out a purchase and sale transaction directly
    on the Internet, without resorting to the center of financial transactions.

- en: In the midst of the global financial crisis of 2008, somebody under the name
    of Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin and created its original reference implementation.
    He released the first Bitcoin software that launched the network and the first
    units of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Bitcoin became a new type of digital currency,
    which was very different from all the others. Its main difference lies in the
    fact that it is decentralized. Therefore, each participant cannot influence its
    fate.

    do not know each other, and it's logical that they do not trust each other. So
    how can they be sure that payments are carried out and their money will not be
    stolen? However, everything was thought out in advance by Satoshi Nakamoto and
    carefully described by me in the book Mastering Bitcoin for Starters. Suffice
    it to say that Nakamoto’s vision for a decentralized currency held true, solving
    many problems.

    attempts have been made to disclose it because some people believe that Satoshi
    Nakamoto is a group of people rather than one person. However, none of these attempts
    has proved successful.
