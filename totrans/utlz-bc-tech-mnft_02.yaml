- en: Blockchain technologies have lately risen to the top of the academic and industry
    agendas, owing to their potential advantages across a wide range of sectors. This
    is due to their practical skills in resolving many problems that are presently
    impeding progress in different industrial sectors. These problems include securely
    capturing and exchanging transactional data, creating automated and efficient
    supply chain procedures, and improving transparency throughout the whole value
    chain. Blockchain provides an effective method to address these problems using
    distributed, shared, secure, and permission transactional ledgers. The uses of
    blockchain technology in the manufacturing and logistics sectors have been examined
    in this chapter. The study shows many possibilities for using blockchain in different
    industrial sectors; nevertheless, certain obstacles must be solved before this
    technology can be fully used. This chapter also covers case studies and difficulties
    encountered in the industrial and logistics sectors while using blockchain.

    sectors. Many existing commercial and industrial processes can benefit from these
    features, which can help them improve, optimize, secure and simplify their operations.
    They also enable the development of new business models that were difficult to
    achieve just a few years ago. These new business models impact numerous industries,
    including banking, medical care, manufacturing and logistics. While the Internet
    has helped create many of today's business and service models, safe registration
    and ensuring commercial transactions between different parties always have problems.
    Companies and people may now record and preserve their contracts signed by the
    blockchain advent.

    users (organizations, businesses, individuals, software agents, etc.). Its content
    is agreed upon by all parties concerned. All transactions are safe and can't be
    changed once they've been added. It also enables comprehensive transaction monitoring,
    measuring, and tracing. Without a governing authority, Blockchain allows a group
    of companies to agree on a specific transaction and record that agreement. Blockchain
    can be used to record, secure and communicate their agreed actions. A cash transaction
    from one member to another, a purchase, a voting engagement, or a patient's medical
    lab test entry are examples of agreed upon activities. Multiple parties collaborating
    on a particular job, contract agreements, and supply chain logistics are just
    a few examples of such operations.

    with cryptographic techniques to ensure that completed agreements are legitimate.
    No approved or registered activity may be altered without the participation of
    the other participating organizations. This functionality is ideal for facilitating
    other commercial agreements amongst a group of organizations from various locations.
    In addition to preserving the sequence of events, blockchain can guarantee the
    accuracy of recorded transactions over time. It is virtually difficult to falsify
    records or reject an agreement since no one can independently change any recorded
    transactions. Consequently, numerous sectors and companies are contemplating adopting
    blockchain, and more research is being conducted to use blockchain in these areas

    can benefit from these features by improving, optimizing, securing and simplifying
    them. They also enable the development of new business models that were previously
    difficult to develop. These innovative business models impact areas such as finance,
    healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. While the internet has contributed to
    the development of many of today's business and service models, concerns remain
    about how to securely register and guarantee agreements between the numerous parties
    involved in commercial transactions. With the advent of blockchain technology,
    businesses and individuals can now record and preserve their transacted agreements
    with each other. The typical applications of blockchain technology are shown in

    information technology, is a life-changing invention. Its usefulness extends well
    beyond digital currencies and financial assets, as it was created as part of Bitcoin's
    fundamental design in 2008 (Nakamoto, 2008) . The technology is still in its infancy
    and has yet to be adopted by the general public or businesses. There have been
    numerous improvements, new use cases, and applications as the technology have
    risen in recent years (Bogart & Rice, 2015). The possibilities for Blockchain
    applications are endless, ranging from digital money to Blockchain-enabled legal
    contracts (Buterin & others, 2014), with the most promising applications still
    being researched.

    the users such as organizations, businesses, individuals, software agents, etc.
    Its content has been agreed upon by all parties involved. All transactions are
    secure and cannot be changed once they are entered. It also allows for accurate
    transaction tracking, measurement, and tracing. Blockchain allows parties to agree
    on a specific activity and record that agreement in the absence of a governing
    body. Blockchain technology has the potential to be used to record, secure, and
    transmit agreed-upon actions. A cash transaction from one member to another, a
    purchase activity, a vote activity, or a medical lab test entry for a patient
    are all examples of agreed-upon activities. Collaboration on multi-party projects,
    contract negotiations, and supply chain logistics are some of the other activities.
    To guarantee the validity of completed agreements, blockchain technology benefits
    peer-to-peer networks with cryptographic techniques. Without the involvement of
    the other participating entities, none of the authorized and registered actions
    may be altered. This functionality is ideal for facilitating other commercial
    agreements amongst a group of companies from various locations. Furthermore, in
    addition to preserving the order of events, blockchain can verify the accuracy
    of documented transactions over time. Therefore, it is almost hard to falsify
    records or reject an agreement since no one can independently modify any recorded
    transactions. As a result, numerous sectors and organizations are contemplating

    century, given its effect on a wide range of industries, from banking to manufacturing

    in 1991\. Their original goal was to establish a cryptographically secure chain
    of blocks that would guarantee that no one could tamper with the timestamps on
    documents. Merkle trees were added to their system in 1992, increasing efficiency
    and allowing them to store more documents on a single block. However, due to the
    efforts of one individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Blockchain History
    begins to acquire significance in 2008\. Blockchain technology is attributed to
    Satoshi Nakamoto as the brains behind it. Individuals think Nakamoto may be a
    person or a group of people that worked on Bitcoin, the first use of digital ledger
    technology, but very little is known about him (Rathee, 2020). The Figure 2 depicts
    the history of blockchain technology from 1990s to 2018.

    Nakamoto published the first whitepaper on the technology (Iredale, 2020). In
    the whitepaper, he explained how the technology was particularly well suited to
    bolstering digital trust because of the decentralisation component, which meant
    that no one could ever control anything. The digital ledger technology has evolved
    since Satoshi Nakamoto left the scene and turned over Bitcoin development to other
    core developers, resulting in additional applications that make up the blockchain

- en: A blockchain is a growing collection of linked documents, referred to as blocks,
    linked and protected using encryption techniques (Bogart & Rice, 2015). The connections
    established from one block to the next are the key to the efficacy of this list,
    making it impossible to alter any block once it has been put to the list. As a
    result, the term “blockchain” comes from the fact that it is essentially a chain
    of data blocks. This list is a password-protected online register for recording
    agreed-upon and completed transactions between various companies or organizations.
    Financial, commercial, industrial, and system operations are all examples of activities
    that produce recorded transactions. The transaction blocks are typically timestamped,
    encrypted, and duplicated across many locations, and they cannot be changed.

- en: Blockchain can record certain transactions by connecting individuals or companies
    through a network (activities). Members of the group can typically view previously
    recorded transactions, but no one can edit or delete them. As a result, Blockchain
    keeps an immutable record of the group's actions. This history is shared with
    all or part of the group. All recorded transactions have a high degree of traceability
    and transparency, and anyone involved can view them. However, it is ensured that
    these records (or blocks) cannot be changed by anyone in the group that created
    them, nor by anyone else. The group agrees on the logical relationships between
    transactions, but changing them is difficult because they are irreversible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most significant aspects of blockchain technology is that it permits
    two or more organisations to securely record an agreement for specified acts over
    a public network like the Internet without the participation of a third party
    like a licenced firm or government agency. The parties may or may not be acquainted,
    and they most certainly do not trust one another. They can still agree, document
    the transaction, and have it added to the chain. As a result, when the agreement
    is attached to the chain, none of the parties involved may change, cancel, or
    deny the agreement's record. The authenticity and integrity of the executed agreements
    added to the chain is ensured through a process known as mining. This crucial
    function was not accessible before the blockchain's introduction. As a result,
    blockchain is the most important facilitator of the Internet of Transactions (Abeyratne
    & Monfared, 2016), (Mainelli & Milne, 2016) and is required to support a wide
    range of industrial applications.

    DLT is a decentralized, secure, and transparent data storage and transmission
    system that does not rely on a centrally trusted third party. A distributed ledger
    is a decentralized database that is maintained by a peer-to-peer network of numerous
    nodes. Each node verifies and replicates the ledger. One kind of DLT is blockchain.
    On the blockchain, data is split into blocks and connected by an append-only structure.
    The most common DLT data structure is the chain-based block structure, although
    it is far from the only one. DLT may be implemented using other data structures,
    such as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BlockDAG and Transaction DAG are the two types of DAG-based DLT (TDAG). The
    BlockDAG structure is a DAG in which each block may refer to many preceding blocks.
    Inclusive Two examples of blockDAG systems are BlockDAG (Lewenberg, Sompolinsky,
    & Zohar, 2015) and Spectre (Sompolinsky, Lewenberg, & & Zohar, 2016). Transactions
    are immediately added to a graph in the TDAG-based DLT, creating a graph of transactions.
    Therefore, each transaction refers to many prior ones. Two typical TDAG systems
    are IOTA (Xie, et al., 2019) and Byteball (Xie, et al., 2019). Because blockchain
    is the most commonly used distributed ledger system, we will concentrate on it
    in this article.

    and consortium blockchain (Cui, et al., 2017). The consortium and private blockchains
    are both permissioned, whereas the public blockchain is permissionless. On the
    public blockchain, anybody may join the network, participate in the consensus
    process, read and send transactions, and keep track of the shared ledger. Permissionless
    blockchain systems are used by the majority of cryptocurrencies and open-source
    blockchain platforms. Bitcoin (Li, et al., 2010) and Ethereum (Steiner, Baker,
    Wood, & Meiklejohn, 2015) are two of the most well-known public blockchain platforms.
    Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency,

    that contain a complete transaction record list. A blockchain is shown in Figure
    1 as an example. A block has just one parent block if the block header contains
    a last block hash. Uncle blocks' hashes (children of the block's predecessors)

    Logistics management is critical for every company to guarantee fair pricing and
    timely delivery of raw material and supplies for its operations. It also aids
    in the effective and timely distribution of their goods to meet their consumers'
    requirements. Using blockchain for industrial logistics management may decrease
    time delays, management expenses, and human mistakes, just like any other logistics
    management program (Buterin & others, 2014). As a result, businesses may lower
    their production costs while also becoming nimbler and more competitive.

    process and commercial activity aiming to deliver more personalized goods and
    services to consumers. Using this technique, manufacturing businesses may be able
    to increase their competitiveness. When multiple manufacturing companies collaborate
    to share their social manufacturing resources and create a social manufacturing
    network for the benefit of all members, the success of this technique can be increased.
    With more social manufacturing resources in this network, a manufacturing company

    the items, such as their previous locations, the length of time they've been stored
    at the facility, and more. Detailed inventory auditing may be simplified using
    IoT sensors, lowering the risk of missing goods, incorrect storage, and other
    issues that impact total profitability.

    an average of 42 days to settle an invoice in full, which is a waste of time and
    money. A smart contract is a blockchain-based technology that enables supply chain
    legal binding agreements to be automated. Smart contracts allow businesses to
    track the stages in a logistical process and enforce adherence to the transaction's
    pre-determined standards, lowering the chance of the other party failing to fulfill
    an agreement (Scand, 2020). This is especially useful for enabling smaller and
    less known businesses, such as start-ups, to enter the supply chain industry without
    a prior reputation or references. Smart contracts, by ensuring transparency, may
    help to mitigate this problem.

    Additionally, companies may analyse the performance of individual vehicles in
    the fleet and past carrier performance, such as on-time pickups and deliveries,
    among other things (Scand, 2020). This information enables better decision-making
    and, as a result, supply chain improvement. Businesses may create faster routes
    and eliminate needless stages in the shipping process using important data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We covered just a few blockchain use scenarios in the manufacturing industry.
    The technology is still far from being extensively adopted, and there are numerous
    obstacles such as industry-wide standards and more. However, one thing is that
    blockchain may change how manufacturers are doing business. The slow-moving, unsecured,
    manual system is being revolutionized into a digital, safe, quick, and automated
    network run on a single platform. In terms of process change, money transfers,
    supply chain monitoring, guarantee management and more, we may anticipate more
    blockchain until we ultimately see an entire, decentralized manufacturing system.
    Although we see a blockchain revolution occurring mainly now in white papers and
    papers, but as more and more companies are piloting their cases of use to disrupt
    the manufacturing industry, we can be sure that most companies will soon embrace
    it to try to survive when the fourth industrial revolution comes into being. Logistics
    is one of the major problems in today's company development. But the entire ball
    game is different if you are a member of a logistics business. Important players
    include manufacturers, suppliers, 3PLs, long-haul carriers, short-haul carriers,
    warehouses, and consignors. The use of various data storage strategies, integration
    with the present ecosystem, the development of blockchain technology, and information
    flow are the primary difficulties facing the logistics business right now. Inventory
    tracking, increased transparency, dispute resolution, and invoicing and payments
    are some of the logistics use cases for blockchain. Nonetheless, even in these
    cases, blockchain offers many success factors in logistics.
