    that contains digital information. Despite the fact that faultfinders are challenging
    its durability, safety and stability, it has oﬃcially changed the way of life
    of numerous people due to its overwhelming impact on many applications. The blockchain
    emerged as a novel distributed consensus scheme that allows transactions, and
    any other data, to be securely stored and verified without the need of any centralized
    authority. Distributed trust and therefore security and privacy are at the core
    of the blockchain technologies, and have the potential to either make them a success
    or cause them to fail. Although the feature of blockchain technologies may bring
    us more reliable and convenient services, the security issues and challenges behind
    this innovative technique is also an important topic that we need to concern.
    In this chapter, we will try to present security threats to the blockchain because
    a hacker cannot modify the data on the blockchain because each user has a copy
    of the book and the data in the block is encrypted. This chapter also describes
    security attacks and their prevention for developing advanced blockchain systems.

    integration of technology into mathematics, cryptography, algorithms, financial
    models and more. Blockchain is the fastest growing trend. Blockchain are the easiest
    way to execute transactions because they use cryptocurrencies that are immune

    and sharable leader of all cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain supports distributed
    databases, in which different computer systems can be created. Each and every
    computer on the network is referred to as a junction or a point, and each node
    on the network automatically receives an identical copy of the blockchain in the
    remote locations that it downloaded. We can also say that this is a public lead
    for all cryptocurrency transactions stored in a continuous order to help customers
    track transactions. Transaction details are distributed to all permanently engraved
    members of the block, each member owning several bitcoins.

    secrecy. As we can see that many cryptocurrencies cannot provide benami assets
    in which the two addresses are in the same wallet and belong to the same user.
    Therefore, unlinkability is not possible as the same user uses dissimilar addresses
    for the input. While, the public chain discloses all the data used for transaction,
    the coins that used for transaction is also discloses to all the users. If the
    user is considering Bitcoin, then these aspects are visible in the recent work,
    which guides strict security principles for future reference based on past actions.

    used to create new cryptocurrencies which includes secret assets. Some of the
    proposals are discussed below. In this direction, it is one of the first mixing
    policies based on accountability policy to highlight the use and theft of random
    mixing fees. Furthermore, this approach provides optimization of the mix network
    for bitcoins to perform indistinguishable features against active attackers. In
    addition, BlindCoin has expanded the MixcoinProtocol to improve privacy features.
    In particular, the authors proposed that the blind signature scheme be used to
    ensure that any user hidden to the mixing server has input/output address mapping.
    Another mixing mechanism has been proposed, which deals with coinjoin.

    personal computers by orders of magnitude in terms of both mining power (number
    of hashes per second) and mining energy eﬃciency (number of hashes per watt).
    In addition, specialized mining hardware is usually very expensive. As a result,
    they mostly end up in the hands of a small number of groups, such as owners of
    big mining farms and ASIC miner manufacturers. One possible approach to democratizing
    mining power is to design ASIC proof hashing algorithms for PoW.

    are other ways of ensuring trust. For example, verifiable computation and secured
    hardware allows clients to run code on untrusted platforms. In doing so, an untrusted
    platform generates verifiable proofs for clients to vet the correctness of computation.
    With verifiable computation, trusting the majority of system nodes does not need
    to be assumed any more. As another example, formal verification and certified
    programming allow programmers to provide a mathematical proof showing that a blockchain
    implementation meets its specification by construction. This could be used to
    eliminate the unintended behaviors in blockchain implementations.

    For example, many programming constructs, such as concurrent data structures,
    can be borrowed from extensive programming languages research in past decades.
    Second, the smart contract runtime needs to be redesigned to support parallel
    execution of smart contracts and at the same time still maintains a deterministic
    transaction order and keeps all the transactional guarantees. Many existing approaches

    Blockchain is important and may be renewable because Blockchain provides identity
    building trust. At the time confidence in institutions and authority figures is
    waning, a new system of trust is much needed.

    the rule of law, though, the credibility has been established through peer interaction
    in peer relationships where the trust system exists based on shared values. Blockchain
    creates a new build for trust, shared. Trust is not imposed on anyone a character
    in the system, but, rather, placed in the system as a whole. Blockchain technology
    makes it possible to rely on trust that everyone in the program shares the same
    information; me it comes from the same computer that will fit every other time.
    By moving a trust agency in a program that can be legally certified, you need
    to trust any single person. Therefore the system of “Reliable trust.”

    new to suit the legitimacy. Unfortunately, this can be diﬃcult, especially for
    a startup company that does not have the manpower or funding. If you want to avoid
    all the obstacles and legal implications that may arise in the future, it is best
    to create a new business model from scratch. This means rethinking all aspects
    of the business model, especially your channels, revenue streams, key sources
