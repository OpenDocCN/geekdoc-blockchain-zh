    blockchain development. As with any technology, there is a level of trust required
    and the expectation that each participant will honestly participate. However,
    that’s a naïve assumption, since there will always be dishonest and malicious
    individuals who would jeopardize the entire system for marginal personal benefits.
    As the technology grows and becomes popular, the potential for illicit gains or
    profiteering increases as well, further incentivizing the duplicitous characters
    to benefit from nefarious activities rather than earn reasonable income by following
    the rules. For the technology to grow and be widely adopted, these vulnerabilities
    and weaknesses have to be adequately addressed. Current research in computer science
    is focusing on these and other vulnerabilities.

    of the drug or tampering of the expiry date. There are some instances when medicine
    has been tampered with leading to devastating outcomes. One such infamous case
    of tampering was that of Tylenol tablets in the United States in 1982\. Three
    members of the same family died in Chicago after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol,
    and four other people died across the nation. This created a panic in the United
    States and cost Johnson and Johnson, the manufacturer of Tylenol, millions of

    business transactions occurring on it. In this section, we describe these challenges.
    The development of blockchain has exploded, both given its promise as well as
    the ease of creating and propagating a blockchain. Naturally, with some useful
    and valid applications, there are also some deceiving ones developed by nefarious
    characters. It is important for a lay investor or professional to be able to tell
    the difference. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the blockchain community
    to ensure that the “shady” actors in their domain are quickly identified and marginalized.

  zh: 另一个需要进一步开发和验证的领域是在重要商业交易发生之前对区块链进行测试和验证智能合约。在本节中，我们描述这些挑战。区块链的发展已经爆炸式增长，这既是因为它的前景，也是因为创建和传播区块链的便利。自然而然，一些有用和有效的应用之外，还有一些由邪恶角色开发的欺骗性应用。对于普通投资者或专业人士来说，能够区分二者是很重要的。此外，区块链社区有责任确保他们领域中的“可疑”行为者能够迅速被识别和边缘化。
- en: Recently, in 2019, there has been an explosion in new blockchain applications
    being introduced. At last count, there were over 700 cryptocurrencies listed.
    As expected, some developers are falsifying their performance to attract unsuspecting
    investors. Moreover, blockchain solutions are being marketed to businesses that
    may or may not meet their needs and requirements. To help address these issues
    there has to be a validation and accreditation organization that tests and validates
    the application to give it some level of credibility.

  zh: 最近，在2019年，新的区块链应用如雨后春笋般涌现。截至目前，已有超过700种加密货币上市。不出所料，一些开发者为了吸引 unsuspecting investors，伪造了他们的性能。此外，区块链解决方案正在被推广给可能满足也可能不满足其需求和要求的商业企业。为了解决这些问题，必须有一个验证和认证组织，该组织测试和验证应用程序以使其具有一定程度的信誉。
- en: 'Any proposed blockchain solution should meet two basic criteria: it should
    have the features inherent in blockchain to be classified as such; and more importantly,
    it should do what it claims to do. The features of blockchain, consensus mechanism,
    smart contracts and tokenization principles should be disclosed and explained.
    At the testing phase, it should be shown to perform as claimed. For example, if
    a new developer claims that their solution improves “throughput” of the blockchain,
    then they should be asked to establish it prior to obtaining validation.'

  zh: 任何提出的区块链解决方案都应满足两个基本标准：它应具备区块链固有的特性，才能被归类为区块链；更重要的是，它应做到它所声称的事情。区块链的特性，如共识机制、智能合约和代币化原则，应予以披露和解释。在测试阶段，应展示其如声称般的表现。例如，如果一名新开发者声称他们的解决方案改进了区块链的“吞吐量”，那么他们应该在获得验证之前被要求证实这一点。
- en: Likewise, specific testing has to be developed to ensure that smart contracts
    satisfy the specifications. That is, they perform the “if-then-else” rule as specified
    and there are no hidden or unfair contract terms. Since these contracts operate
    on self-execution, programing flaws could have dire consequences.

- en: Increased popularity of a specific blockchain application is a double-edged
    sword. Increased popularity implies an increase in the number of transactions
    that now have to be stored in the blockchain. In other words, the blockchain may
    become “bulky.” Each node has to store all transactions and have to validate these.
    An increase in the number of transactions implies greater storage requirements
    as well as processing requirements to validate these transactions. Scalability
    of blockchain solutions, therefore, is an important feature. Currently, research
    is ongoing on how to “lightweight” the bulky blockchains, either by removing old
    transactions or by outsourcing time-consuming computations. Advances in this area
    are needed to ensure that the technology is capable of handling the increased
    load, and its own increased popularity does not cause it to fail.

  zh: 特定区块链应用的日益普及是一把双刃剑。日益普及意味着现在必须存储在区块链上的交易数量增加了。换句话说，区块链可能会变得“庞大”。每个节点都必须存储所有交易并对其进行验证。交易数量的增加意味着更大的存储需求以及验证这些交易的处理需求。因此，区块链解决方案的可扩展性是一个重要特性。目前，研究正在进行中，探讨如何使庞大的区块链“轻量化”，无论是通过移除旧交易还是通过外包耗时的计算。在这一领域的进步是确保技术能够处理增加的负载，以及其自身日益增加的普及度不会导致其失败的必要条件。
- en: Another key feature of blockchain is the privacy and anonymity it provides to
    its users. Though not fully anonymous, there was a degree of pseudo-anonymity
    that blockchain participants have to come to expect. With increased number of
    transactions, the privacy and anonymity of very active participants could be ascertained.
    Current research is ongoing to ensure preservation of privacy despite increase
    in transaction volume by the participant.

    a database with very detailed, tamper-free and easily accessible records. There
    are some benefits of having a system to perennially store data, however, not much
    value-added propositions can be created merely through a storage service. Storage
    of detailed data with a mechanism with analyzing that data could lead to powerful
    and beneficial combination. Hence, in future it is conceivable that blockchain
    would be combined with big data analytics or other machine learning techniques.
    It is a natural marriage between a data management system and data analytic technique.

    of data. This combined with big data techniques could lead to useful and valid
    insights. In future, for example, consumer data and purchases could be stored

- en: Another potential area of advancement is embedding AI techniques into smart
    contracts. Currently, smart contracts are basic “if-then-else” rules that are
    pre-programed into the system. All eventualities and pre-conditions have to be
    foreseen and programed into the smart contract. This in a manner of speaking is
    “narrow intelligence.” As blockchain technology develops, it is conceivable that
    the smart contracts of the future would develop its own “if-then-else” rule based
    on machine learning techniques. With the incorporation of AI and machine learning
    techniques, the smart contracts can evolve and learn certain functions and rules

- en: Combining blockchain with AI techniques could have far-reaching business and
    regulatory implications. For example, with all the data stored in the blockchain,
    a properly programed smart contract could look through transactions of all participants
    and identify “red flags” on money laundering and alert relevant authorities, banks
    and regulators. This will immensely aid in the “know your customer” compliance

- en: Currently, there are many independent blockchains that exist and an individual
    may be a participant in multiple blockchains. However, since there is no communication
    across the blockchain, the data for each participant is restricted to the transactions
    they engage in on a particular blockchain ecosystem. Thus, anyone following the
    audit trail of such an individual or organization has to access and audit each
    and every blockchain ecosystem that the individual participates in. It is conceivable
    that in near future, multiple blockchain ecosystems would be combined into a *blockmatrix*.
    Each blockchain will form a column in the matrix and each participant the row.
    Down the column, one can identify all the participants of the blockchain, and
    across a row it will now be possible to identify all the blockchain ecosystem
    the individual or the organization subscribes to. This kind of feature would lead
    to greater transparency and limit the individual’s ability to profit from arbitrage
    opportunities by compromising one blockchain ecosystem to benefit another.
