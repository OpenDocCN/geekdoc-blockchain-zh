    and the expectation that each participant will honestly participate. However,
    that’s a naïve assumption, since there will always be dishonest and malicious
    individuals who would jeopardize the entire system for marginal personal benefits.
    As the technology grows and becomes popular, the potential for illicit gains or
    profiteering increases as well, further incentivizing the duplicitous characters
    to benefit from nefarious activities rather than earn reasonable income by following
    the rules. For the technology to grow and be widely adopted, these vulnerabilities
    and weaknesses have to be adequately addressed. Current research in computer science
    is focusing on these and other vulnerabilities.

    of medical devices, such as ventilators, face masks and other personal protective
    equipment to healthcare workers and first responders in the “hot zones” was essential
    during the COVID pandemic. Much inefficiencies and delays were caused by problems
    of bureaucratic coordination and archaic centralized systems. A distributed network
    wherein each participant could request supplies as well as donate surplus supplies

    shift in business practices. Over the past century the energy grid was centrally
    managed. Energy produced in one location was delivered in a different location
    to largely passive, “price-taking” consumers. Driven by declining cost of alternative
    energy and consumer awareness, the past model started to transition at the turn
    of the century toward a more flexible and distributed energy model. As blockchain
    provides the infrastructure to manage distributed processing and control of information,
    energy sector is actively exploring the use of blockchain technology across many
    of its functions including peer-to-peer energy trading, trading of energy options,
    supply chain tracking and others. It is conceivable that blockchain will assist

    the consumers more demanding. Managing a number of decentralized resources from

    Presently, this is a time-consuming and complex task requiring details about trading
    countries, package contents, number of items, individual costs, currency, etc.,

    these vulnerabilities and altering the algorithm to minimize the risk and/or the
    damage. Traditional attacks against Bitcoin consisted of waiting for an external
    action, such as shipping of goods, before discarding the transaction from the
    main branch. This revoking of the original transaction allowed the buyer to double-spend

    with any transaction system. The miscreant would like to make multiple purchases
    with his legitimate resources, by taking advantage of the time lag in the system
    to record and implement the transaction. In traditional setting, it is tantamount
    to “check kiting” where twice the legitimate balance is shown by transferring
    funds from one financial institution to another.

    has made payments but not the ones in which he received the goods or services.
    Since the payment transaction has already been confirmed by the network, to revert
    the transaction the miscreant will issue a new transaction nullifying the previous
    one. For example, the miscreant (*M*) purchases some goods from the victim (*V*)
    and pays them through smart contract. Later, they revert the transaction by booking
    another transaction reversing the previous payment transaction, and thereby in
    essence nullifying the payment.

    the blockchain ecosystem. Desynchronization can be caused by exceedingly long
    delays in message delivery.

    two transactions for payment, one to the victim and one to themselves. It consists
    of solo mining a block with a transaction that sends coins to itself without broadcasting
    it to the rest of the network. Next, it engages in a transaction that double-spends
    the coin. Once the goods are delivered, the malicious node broadcasts its block
    to override the payment to the merchant. If the merchant waits a while for additional
    blocks to be mined, prior to shipping the goods, the merchant could subvert such

    Bribery attacks are possible in blockchains employing proof of work consensus
    mechanism. In proof of work consensus mechanism, miners could participate without
    having any stake in the system. Thus miners are motivated only by the economic
    rewards of mining the blocks. In this setting, a malicious agent could offer a
    bribe greater than the reward for honestly generating a block. Many economically
    rational miners would have clear incentive to accept the bribe and participate
    in the attack. Bribery attacks are less effective in blockchains that use the

    releases them strategically. Through coordinated release of subsequent blocks,
    the attacker could force dropping of legitimately created blocks from the blockchain.
    Through this mechanism, the attacker adversely affects the growth of the chain
    and increases the relative ratio of adversary blocks. In blockchain system, when
    the miner gets rewards for mining new blocks, the attacker can obtain greater
    rewards than if it were following an honest strategy of releasing blocks.

    portion of its hashing power is in control of malicious participants. Similar
    to “long-range attacks,” the miscreants will keep their mined blocks without broadcasting
    it to the rest of the chain. The private branch will be revealed to the public
    at a strategic time, only when the private branch is longer than the public branch.
    During the time the private branch is hidden, honest miners are wasting their
    time mining the useless branch, whereas miscreants are creating the private branch
    without any competition from others. Thereby, selfish miners get more revenue
    while wasting the resources of honest miners.

    mining, the miners continue to work on the private chain even though the public
    chain is longer. The stubborn miners then also engage in network-level eclipse
    attack (discussed above). It has been shown that malicious nodes with less than
    25% of computational resources can still gain more rewards from selfish mining
    than by honestly creating blocks.

    The motivation behind this type of attack is to unjustly influence the leader
    selection process. Doing so, improves the chances of the malicious node to be
    selected as the leader, despite having low stake in the blockchain. Once selected
    the leaders, the malicious nodes can then engage illegitimate activities. The
    malicious node tests several possible block headers and block contents to find
    what gives it the best chance of being selected as a slot leader in the future.

    does not require computational efforts, the participants can simultaneously create
    and participate in multiple blockchains. In this kind of attack, the legitimate

    to deter attacks. These stakeholders might hedge against financial losses by accepting

    are well recognized the proponents of blockchain. First and foremost is the need
    for the blockchain industry to attract qualified professionals. The blockchain
    sector will need professionals with a well-defined skill portfolio comprising
    of accounting, business and technology expertise. A new role will emerge, that
    of an intermediary between accounting, legal and business experts and the developers
    of blockchain. This book attempts at bridging that gap by presenting technical
    concepts in context familiar to business professionals.

    testing of blockchain and validating of smart contracts prior to consequential
    business transactions occurring on it. In this section, we describe these challenges.
    The development of blockchain has exploded, both given its promise as well as
    the ease of creating and propagating a blockchain. Naturally, with some useful
    and valid applications, there are also some deceiving ones developed by nefarious
    characters. It is important for a lay investor or professional to be able to tell
    the difference. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the blockchain community
    to ensure that the “shady” actors in their domain are quickly identified and marginalized.

    being introduced. At last count, there were over 700 cryptocurrencies listed.
    As expected, some developers are falsifying their performance to attract unsuspecting
    investors. Moreover, blockchain solutions are being marketed to businesses that
    may or may not meet their needs and requirements. To help address these issues
    there has to be a validation and accreditation organization that tests and validates
    the application to give it some level of credibility.

    have the features inherent in blockchain to be classified as such; and more importantly,
    it should do what it claims to do. The features of blockchain, consensus mechanism,
    smart contracts and tokenization principles should be disclosed and explained.
    At the testing phase, it should be shown to perform as claimed. For example, if
    a new developer claims that their solution improves “throughput” of the blockchain,
    then they should be asked to establish it prior to obtaining validation.'

    satisfy the specifications. That is, they perform the “if-then-else” rule as specified
    and there are no hidden or unfair contract terms. Since these contracts operate
    on self-execution, programing flaws could have dire consequences.

    sword. Increased popularity implies an increase in the number of transactions
    that now have to be stored in the blockchain. In other words, the blockchain may
    become “bulky.” Each node has to store all transactions and have to validate these.
    An increase in the number of transactions implies greater storage requirements
    as well as processing requirements to validate these transactions. Scalability
    of blockchain solutions, therefore, is an important feature. Currently, research
    is ongoing on how to “lightweight” the bulky blockchains, either by removing old
    transactions or by outsourcing time-consuming computations. Advances in this area
    are needed to ensure that the technology is capable of handling the increased
    load, and its own increased popularity does not cause it to fail.

    its users. Though not fully anonymous, there was a degree of pseudo-anonymity
    that blockchain participants have to come to expect. With increased number of
    transactions, the privacy and anonymity of very active participants could be ascertained.
    Current research is ongoing to ensure preservation of privacy despite increase
    in transaction volume by the participant.

    a database with very detailed, tamper-free and easily accessible records. There
    are some benefits of having a system to perennially store data, however, not much
    value-added propositions can be created merely through a storage service. Storage
    of detailed data with a mechanism with analyzing that data could lead to powerful
    and beneficial combination. Hence, in future it is conceivable that blockchain
    would be combined with big data analytics or other machine learning techniques.
    It is a natural marriage between a data management system and data analytic technique.
    The former without the latter is of limited use, and the latter without the former
    is superfluous.

    of data. This combined with big data techniques could lead to useful and valid

    to identify purchasing pattern or change in that pattern as people age.

    contracts. Currently, smart contracts are basic “if-then-else” rules that are
    pre-programed into the system. All eventualities and pre-conditions have to be
    foreseen and programed into the smart contract. This in a manner of speaking is
    “narrow intelligence.” As blockchain technology develops, it is conceivable that
    the smart contracts of the future would develop its own “if-then-else” rule based
    on machine learning techniques. With the incorporation of AI and machine learning
    techniques, the smart contracts can evolve and learn certain functions and rules
    and be able to function independently in a semi-autonomous manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Combining blockchain with AI techniques could have far-reaching business and
    regulatory implications. For example, with all the data stored in the blockchain,
    a properly programed smart contract could look through transactions of all participants
    and identify “red flags” on money laundering and alert relevant authorities, banks
    and regulators. This will immensely aid in the “know your customer” compliance
    of the financial institutions.

    may be a participant in multiple blockchains. However, since there is no communication
    across the blockchain, the data for each participant is restricted to the transactions
    they engage in on a particular blockchain ecosystem. Thus, anyone following the
    audit trail of such an individual or organization has to access and audit each
    and every blockchain ecosystem that the individual participates in. It is conceivable
    that in near future, multiple blockchain ecosystems would be combined into a *blockmatrix*.
    Each blockchain will form a column in the matrix and each participant the row.
    Down the column, one can identify all the participants of the blockchain, and
    across a row it will now be possible to identify all the blockchain ecosystem
    the individual or the organization subscribes to. This kind of feature would lead
    to greater transparency and limit the individual’s ability to profit from arbitrage
    opportunities by compromising one blockchain ecosystem to benefit another.

    anonymous transactions on cryptocurrencies. Hence, its development and growth
    will likely be powered by the financial industry. There still is untapped potential
    for blockchain-based solutions in the issuance and retirement of securities. There
    are possibilities of developing blockchain applications using smart contracts
    in derivative markets. Of course, for blockchain to continue to flourish in the
    financial industry, it has to be acceptable to relevant regulators. Regulators
    are likely to encourage adoption and application of blockchain-based solutions
    due to its immutability and autoexecutory smart contracts. This potentially could
    increases compliance and verifiability of transactions engaged in the blockchain
    ecosystem. For example, smart contracts could forbid or prevent certain illegal
    transactions from occurring.

    it is imperative for the legitimate members of the blockchain community to monitor
    such occurrences and alert necessary authorities early to mitigate damage. For
    increasing occurrences of business failures and fraud schemes on blockchain platform
    will erode public’s trust in the system, thereby inhibiting its growth and limiting
    its potential. Effective governance is a key to the successful and thriving proliferation
    of blockchain applications. Ultimately, protecting participants, investors and
