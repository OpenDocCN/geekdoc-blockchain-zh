    for Web 3.0 and highlighted many live applications across a variety of industries.
    This is our first chapter in the ‘Road to Maturity’ section of the book. This
    chapter focuses on developments aiming to improve blockchain technologies. We
    specifically address solutions for the massive resource consumption for certain
    protocols; security; performance and scalability; anonymity for public blockchains;
    confidentiality for private blockchains; and interoperability. We’ve also included
    some behavioral practices that readers can take to reduce their risks when using
    these technologies. There are three things every reader must do: first, protect
    your private keys; second, protect your private keys; and third, protect your
    private keys! By the end of this chapter, readers will be well equipped to understand
    the debates and conversations around these technologies. Readers will be able
    to explain some quite sophisticated technical concepts, such as the threat of
    quantum computing, zero-knowledge proofs (interactive and non-interactive), and
    interoperability methods for cross-chain transaction processing (notaries, sidechains,
    and hash-time locked contracts (HTLCs)). It sounds intimidating at first, but
    our coverage will ease the learning journey.'

    The computational intensity of a given blockchain’s consensus protocol is the
    main driver of resource consumption. Recalling from [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml),
    Bitcoin and Ethereum use the safest, yet computationally most resource-demanding
    protocol called Proof-of-Work. Bitcoin’s first miners back in 2009 could successfully
    compete for a block reward using their desktop computers. As Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed,
    miners shifted to specialized hardware and shared computational power through
    mining pools. Specifically, Bitcoin requires an Application-Specific Integrated
    Circuit (ASIC). Ethereum mining requires a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Proof-of-Work
    is admittedly a resource hog for both of these public networks. In order to compete,
    large mining centers have been established (see [Figure 10.1](#f_10_1) for an
    example).

    many blockchains have had heists resulting from software weaknesses in the code
    base. These typically happen within the first year of launch when the code base
    is still very new. The Bitcoin blockchain was hacked in August 2010 when someone
    exploited a software vulnerability to create 184 *billion* bitcoins, a highly
    suspicious act given the maximum money supply is only 21 *million* bitcoins.^([11](#fn_11))
    A hacker of Ripple was able to transfer 1000 bitcoins from an address that had
    only .0001 bitcoins in 2014.^([12](#fn_12)) As software updates are implemented,
    new vulnerabilities could be introduced. For example, a serious bug in a Bitcoin
    Core update was discovered in 2018 that could have brought down the network with
    a denial-of-service attack, a type of malicious attack that floods a network with
    so many transactions that it disrupts service for legitimate users. Fortunately,
    the Bitcoin Core developers spotted it and fixed it before hackers could exploit
    it.^([13](#fn_13)) Although the source code was fixed quickly, these episodes

    distinctive. Performance is about the length of time it takes for a transaction
    to be processed in a system; scalability refers to the *throughput,* i.e., how
    many transactions can be processed per second. Performance and scalability issues
    are significantly greater for public, permissionless blockchains than for private,
    permissioned blockchains. We’ll examine them separately.

- en: Because the *a priori* trust among trading partners is nil in a public blockchain,
    the computer networks need a lot of computational power to validate transactions
    and to constantly monitor the integrity of records. All this computation slows
    down performance and throughput. As we saw in the huge adoption surges in 2017
    and 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum struggled to process transactions within the targeted
    windows. Moreover, settlement times are not fast enough for transactions requiring
    nearly instantaneous reaction times, such as IoT devices that monitor the status
    of critical systems, or for retail applications where a customer will certainly
    not wait around for a transaction to settle. Additionally, public blockchains
    like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered too small in scale to handle the volumes
    that will be required for many enterprise applications. For example, PayPal handles
    about 193 transactions per second, SWIFT—the global provider of secure financial
    messaging services—processes about 329 messages per second,^([36](#fn_36)) and
    Visa handles 1,667 transactions per second (and claimed it could accommodate up

- en: One consequence of public blockchains’ lack of scalability is higher transaction
    costs. For the early years of Bitcoin, transaction fees were indeed very small,
    averaging about 11 cents (in $US) per transaction in June 2014 and 28 cents in
    December of 2016.^([40](#fn_40)) When the network is not congested, very small
    fees are enough to incentivize miners. For a specific example, we found a successful
    transaction on March 12^(th) 2017, where a person offered just 45 cents worth
    of bitcoins to transfer over $8200 worth of bitcoins.^([41](#fn_41)) However,
    when the network is congested, miners cannot include all of the newly validated
    transactions in the next block, so the miners’ algorithms select the transactions
    offering the highest fees. As Bitcoin traffic exploded in December of 2017, fees
    skyrocketed to as high as $55 per transaction.^([42](#fn_42)) During peak times
    in 2017, senders offering smaller fees sometimes waited days to be added to the
    blockchain, or worse, their orphaned transaction eventually dropped out and needed
    to be resent.^([43](#fn_43)) Moving ahead to 2021/2022, Figures [10.6](#f_10_6)
    and [10.7](#f_10_7) show the average transaction fee per transaction in US dollars
    for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Keep in mind, these are *averages*—senders who want
    to guarantee that their transaction is included in the next block offered fees
    as high as hundreds of dollars’ worth of bitcoin or ether.

    the biggest protocol change in Bitcoin since its inception. It improved Bitcoin
    in a number of ways. First, SegWit squeezed more transactions into a block by
    moving digital signatures (called ‘witnesses’) from the sender’s address to a
    new part of a Bitcoin block. By segregating the signatures, block sizes increased
    from 1 megabyte to possibly 4 megabytes, thus improving throughput. This innovation
    also solved ***transaction malleability***, the possibility for a hacker to alter
    a digital signature before it is added to a block, which would change the transaction
    ID. The recipient would still receive the bitcoins, but the sender would not be
    able to find it by searching for the transaction ID (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml)
    for more).

    design, which moved the anchor for the signatures from being embedded in the Merkle
    Root to the first transaction in the block (called the coinbase transaction) used
    to reward the winning miner.^([46](#fn_46)) Another issue was the deployment strategy:
    SegWit was released as a ‘soft fork’, which means than non-SegWit adopters could
    still mine Bitcoins. Some miners thought it would be cleaner (yet more difficult)
    to release as a hard fork. Many emergency meetings occurred among the Bitcoin
    community as SegWit was being debated. SegWit had a rocky adoption^([47](#fn_47)),
    but was activated as a soft fork to the Bitcoin Core in August 2017.^([48](#fn_48))
    Two years later, a little less than half of Bitcoin transactions used SegWit,
    probably because people were slow to upgrade wallets. A faction of the mining

    Let’s assume Alice wants to send Token T to Bob. At the start of the transaction,
    Alice’s wallet currently has possession of the private key that controls the ownership
    of Token T recorded on the blockchain. To safely send the token to Bob in a way
    that prevents Alice from double spending it and ensures that only Bob can retrieve
    it (or that she can retrieve it before Bob does if the agreement goes sour), the
    following steps are executed. First, Alice’s wallet creates a token commitment
    by using her private key to put Token T in escrow controlled by a smart contract
    (called a shield contract) on the blockchain. The shield contract takes control
    over the token. Alice’s software creates a token commitment for Bob using Bob’s
    public key and a secret key only Alice knows. Alice sends Bob’s token commitment
    to the shield contract. Alice’s software also creates Alice’s nullification of
    Alice’s token commitment so she will no longer have control over the token *if*
    Bob retrieves it. Alice’s nullification is sent to the shield contract. Offline,
    Alice sends the secret key, Bob’s token commitment, and the token ID to Bob. This
    message happens *offchain*, so it’s important this message is secured to prevent
    someone other than Bob from using it. Bob can now take possession of Token T by
    proving to the shield contract he knows the secret key. When Bob is ready, his
    software uses the secret key to nullify his token commitment and issues a PayToAddress
    command to move control of the token to Bob’s wallet. When the transaction is
    finished, the balance in the shield contract is zero and Bob has the private key
    that controls Token T in his wallet. Alice will no longer be able to retrieve
    it.

    Alice just send the money to Bob’s wallet directly like Bitcoin does? The way
    Bitcoin works, recipients cannot prevent people from sending value to their addresses.
    In Bitcoin (and in many public blockchains), anyone can ‘air drop’ money into
    someone’s wallet without their permission. Many individuals want—and certainly
    enterprises need—to control their receivables. Nightfall enables that; the recipient
    has to pro-actively retrieve the tokens from the shield contract.

    *“With Nightfall, there is no way for anyone to know that Alice and Bob did a
    transaction between them. All you know is that one of the wallets sent some tokens
    to another wallet, but there’s no way to know what happened between them. And
    that’s the first step. We are developing this further to also include contract
    rules for purchase agreements, such as terms and conditions, but what we have
    right now and what is in the public domain is the ability to move tokens between
    two wallets without anyone knowing what happened.”*

    the asset and then must wait until the transaction has settled and more valid
    blocks have been created on top of it so that parties are confident that they
    are dealing with the longest, and thus most valid, chain. After the confirmation
    period, an SPV proof can be submitted to Chain B. Chain B now has to wait, a time
    called the ‘reorg period’. It’s possible, another party may submit an SPV proof
    that contradicts the previous SPV proof. Chain B will select the SPV with the
    longest chain. Once confident the SPV proof is valid, it unlocks the asset on
    Chain B, executes transactions, locks the asset, and waits for the transaction
    to settle before sending an SPV proof back to Chain A.***'

    Two Ripple engineers published the ILP’s white paper back in 2015\. In 2021, the
    Interledger Foundation was formed. Its mission is *“a non-profit advocate for
    the web, promoting innovation, creativity, and inclusion by advancing open payment
    standards and technologies that seamlessly connect our global society.”^([103](#fn_103))*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For a given payment, the ILP protocol sends many micropayments with confirmations
    between micropayments to minimize the risk that a node could steal or fail to
    send a payment through a network (see [Figure 10.20](#f_10_20)). ILP uses ‘cryptographic
    escrow’ that *“conditionally locks funds to allow secure payments through untrusted
    connectors.”^([104](#fn_104))* For a given transaction, the ILP recognizes three
    types of participants: sender, routers, and receiver. Routers (also called ‘connectors’)
    are nodes that find a trust path between the sender and receiver. Nodes use the
    same hashlock for HTLCs across the paths.^([105](#fn_105)) (For a detailed example
    of how HTCLs flow through an end-to-end transaction, see [https://interledger.org/rfcs/0022-hashed-timelock-agreements/](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0022-hashed-timelock-agreements/).)
    While HTLCs are used, they still require that the Interledger Module be updated
    and installed for each of the ledgers (blockchains) that are being interacted
    with. This means that as new platforms come online, if they do not follow a standard
    the protocol recognizes, one needs to be added.'

    11.1](#f_11_1) categorizes the applications by two governance decisions, namely,
    rights of participation and rights of validation. We can think of these as a list
    of winners as of this writing—they survived the arduous journey from idea, proof-of-concept,
    production pilot, to launch. Most innovations do not. At any moment in time, there
    are millions of innovations at different stages of development and most innovations
    fail before or shortly after launch. According to one study, less than 10 percent
    of innovation ideas make it to implementation.^([1](#fn_1)) Once implemented,

    an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or by an
    organization. Rogers studied the speed by which innovations are adopted by members
    of a social system. The target social system may comprise individuals, organizations,
    or both. Bitcoin, for example, can be adopted by individuals because a single
    person can decide to own or to mine bitcoins. Bitcoin can also be adopted by organizations.
    For example, [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) was among the first retailers
    to accept bitcoins as payment; the University of Nicosia was the first university
    to accept bitcoins as tuition payments. Rogers teaches us that the decision-making
    process for individuals is different from the decision-making process for organizations.
    We’ll get to that insight in a moment, but first we need to understand the role
    of time in the diffusion of innovations.

    From Nakamoto’s white paper, Bitcoin has a relative advantage over other payment
    systems because counter-party risks are mitigated with cryptography and with an
    incentivized community of miners instead of relying on trusted third parties;
    it enhances privacy over traditional payment systems; it lowers transaction costs
    compared to traditional payment systems; and it bypasses government fiat currencies.

    and finding someone to send bitcoins to the wallet, or by purchasing bitcoin on
    an exchange. The easiest way to try Bitcoin is to use an exchange, which is what
    most people choose. By using an exchange, the adopter has just wiped-out Bitcoin’s
    relative advantage of no trusted third parties, enhanced privacy, and no government
    oversight. How can we reconcile the conflict between relative advantage and trialability?
    For many individuals, Bitcoin is an investment, so to them, Bitcoin’s relative
    advantage is that it offers higher potential returns than other investments options
    or it increases the diversity of their investment portfolios. From our analysis

    Clayton Christensen to provide us with a richer vocabulary and a theoretical framework.
    Professor Christensen was a chaired professor of management at Harvard Business
    School until his death in 2020\. He spent decades studying and theorizing on technology
    and business model innovations. Beginning with his first book on the subject,
    the *Innovator’s Dilemma,* published in 1997,^([19](#fn_19)) Christensen studied
    how market leaders rise and fall based on their capacity to exploit innovations.
    This theory describes two types of innovations—disruptive and sustaining. He defined
    **disruptive innovation** as a *process* by which an innovation creates a new
    market that eventually disrupts an existing market, thereby displacing the incumbent
    enterprises that currently dominate a market.^([20](#fn_20))

    that produced the Model T automobiles in 1908\. Although the automobile was invented
    in 1886, early models cost so much money that they did not disrupt the traditional
    mode of transportation—the horse and buggy. Ford’s invention of the assembly line
    dramatically reduced the costs of producing a car. It was the invention of the
    assembly line that produced the inexpensive Model T that disrupted the horse and
    buggy market.

- en: What’s most relevant to our blockchain discussion is Christensen’s theory on
    WHO creates disruptive innovations. Christensen considered two types of enterprises—entrants
    and incumbents. New entrants are more likely to create truly disruptive innovations.
    New entrants, such as inventors and startups, have little to lose, are less risk
    averse, and are unconstrained by legacy investments and bureaucracy. Incumbents
    are the existing market leaders—the traditional enterprises that dominant a market.
    Christensen observed that incumbents find it very difficult to break their successful
    business models; they view it as irrational to cannibalize revenues from existing
    products to replace it with a risky disruptive innovation. Instead, incumbents
    focus on **sustaining innovations**, i.e., those innovations that improve products
    and services within existing markets. You can think of sustaining innovations
    as incremental innovations, such as new models of an iPhone or software upgrades.
    [Figure 11.11](#f_11_11) captures the essence of Christensen’s Theory.

    source of disruption. Many times, it’s too late to pivot when a real threat emerges.
    Consider Blockbuster, founded in 1985 in Dallas Texas. Its business model was
    based on retail brick-and-mortar stores that rented videos to customers. The videos
    in those days were stored on physical devices (e.g., DVD, VHS, Blu-Ray). It had
    9,000 stores at its peak of success (in 2004). Netflix was founded in 1997, a
    year when Blockbuster earned $3.54 billion in revenues. The next year, Netflix
    lost $11 million while Blockbuster continued to grow—tiny Netflix hardly seemed
    a threat to Blockbuster. One can imagine Blockbuster’s Board of Directors laughing
    at the thought that this little entrant foretold its ultimate demise. Initially,
    Netflix mailed videos stored on physical devices to customers. When the Internet
    advanced enough to transmit large digital files, Netflix easily pivoted from mail
    delivery to digital streaming services whereas Blockbuster could not. Blockbuster
    was too incumbered by its retail model and it went bankrupt in 2010.^([21](#fn_21))'

    capacity to learn. Nearly every Master of Business (MBA) student has read Christensen’s
    work. Boards of Directors are more aware of the possible threat from entrants
    than they were two decades ago. But being aware of the threat does not diminish
    the real barriers incumbents must overcome in terms of legacy investments, pressure
    to produce positive quarterly earnings reports, and bureaucratic structures that
    can stall the pursuits of disruption. According to Christensen’s theory, incumbents’
    best chances for pursuing disruptive innovations are to spin off an independent
    business unit once an innovation looks promising or to simply acquire a promising
    entrant.

    for [Figure 11.1](#f_11_1) are creating disruptive innovations based on entirely
    new models. Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payment application
    that eliminates the need for trusted third parties—or to use Christensen’s term,
    to by-pass the ‘incumbents’. Vitalik Buterin invented Ethereum and launched it
    with cofounders Mihai Alisie; Amir Chetrit; Charles Hoskinson; Anthony Di Iorio;
    Joseph Lubin; Gavin Wood; and Jeffrey Wilke. Ethereum is a platform for deploying
    decentralized applications (dApps)—anyone can build on it; it’s a completely new
    way to deploy software applications. In [Chapter 5](chapter05.xhtml), we studied
    one Ethereum dApp called Aave; it manages a completely decentralized market for
    lending and borrowing—no need to use traditional banks. While the applications
    in the public-permissionless quadrant have not destroyed the markets for government
    fiat currencies or for traditional banks, we likely are witnessing a disruptive
    innovation process underway. A $2 trillion crypto/blockchain market is not to

    are best characterized as sustaining innovations. These first-generation applications
    are delivering business value, but most of the solutions do not disrupt, transform,
    or obliterate existing market structures. Incumbents came together to uplift all
    parties in an ecosystem rather than to eliminate any one of them. As a general
    observation, no parties were threatened with disintermediation. They can be characterized
    not as a tidal wave of disruption but as a rising tide that lifts all ships. DL
    Freight is an example. Walmart Canada and its freight carriers both benefit from
    the shared invoice; it’s a sustaining innovation that improves and supports the
    existing freight carrier relationships.

- en: In general, these first-generation private-permissioned applications do not
    eliminate trusted third parties but often introduce new ones. The TTPs take on
    different roles; rather than sit in the middle of transactions, these TTPs manage
    network-level services, such as operating network nodes, protecting digital wallets
    on behalf of clients, enforcing access rules set up by members, and managing software
    updates. For example, IBM is the solution provider for Everledger, we.trade, TradeLens,
    and the Food Trust. IBM has no role in mediating the peer-to-peer transactions
    among trading partners—IBM cannot even interpret the data on the private channels.
    However, IBM is the cloud provider for the validator nodes, secures the networks,
    manages the software (including upgrades) and enforces access rules set up by
    participants. Beyond our sample of applications, a 2020 HfS Research survey of
    318 respondents from Global 2000 companies that found only six percent of enterprise
    blockchain applications intend to remove intermediaries.^([22](#fn_22)) Again,
    our point is that private-permissioned blockchains are primarily developed by
    incumbents seeking sustaining innovations, as described by Clayton Christensen.

    that one can recreate the current state (like current account balances) from all
    prior transactions because the transactions never change. Immutability does not
    mean that parties are forever beholden to errors. Errors can be remedied by issuing
    counter transactions. Counter transactions are easier to accomplish in private
    networks where parties know each other than in public networks where parties are
    pseudo-anonymous. In a public network, we’ve seen the example of a hacker of Ethereum
    Classic voluntarily giving back $100,000 to Gate.ui. Most hackers do not voluntarily
    submit reverse transactions. Under that circumstance, the community who controls
    51 percent of the network’s computer power have the power to roll back the ledger,
    as we saw in the 2016 DAO attack on Ethereum. It’s an extremely contentious event
    to roll back a public blockchain ledger because it destroys the property of immutability.

- en: The aim of this chapter was to give readers tools to analyze innovations targeted
    at individuals, organizations, or both. Readers should have a deeper admiration
    for the three-dozen blockchain innovations in [Figure 11.1](#f_11_1) that survived
    the perilous journey from conception to implementation. Readers should also have
    obtained new vocabulary and theoretical frameworks to assess their own ideas for
    innovations. Hopefully we’ve conveyed that not every application will benefit
    from blockchain technologies but that every application should be built on ethical
    design principles! The more ideas readers generate and critically evaluate, the
    more likely they will invent something of value. We conclude this chapter with
    some inspirational quotations:^([33](#fn_33))

    including the aims and aspirations of Web 3.0\. We’ve argued that the decentralization
    of economic and social activities is a way to restore global trust, and that blockchains
    serve as the decentralized digital infrastructure. By now, all readers know that
    blockchain technology is decentralized because each computer node in the network
    is a peer, with no single computer in charge. We’ve made a crucial distinction
    between technology decentralization and governance decentralization; blockchain
    decisions may be made by decentralized or centralized governance structures. Recall
    from [Chapter 2](chapter02.xhtml) that governance decisions comprise a portfolio
    of decision-making rights over the mission/vision, the funding model, rights of
    participation, rights of validation, rights of overrides, and governance residence.

    book, we believe that the future is not deterministic; individuals and organizations
    do not just sit around and wait for the future to happen, they actively create
    it. What will the next innovations bring? The seeds for the next ‘big thing’ are
    already here if we are wise enough to see them because many innovations are ‘combinatorial’,

    including the development of the Internet itself, as covered in [Chapter 1](chapter01.xhtml).
    Before Bitcoin, Nick Szabo conceived of decentralized **digital cash** in 1998
    as Bit Gold, but it was not implemented.^([4](#fn_4)) David Chaum launched DigiCash
    in 1990—the first live cryptocurrency of significance.^([5](#fn_5)) While an important
    breakthrough, DigiCash was centrally controlled in that the company’s system performed
    the validations. Nakamoto combined many ideas in the Bitcoin white paper, such
    as Wei Dai’s concept for b-money—a distributed cryptocurrency with a **public
    ledger** in 1998; **timestamping** from a 1999 multi-authored paper; cryptographic
    **Merkle trees** for security from Merkle’s 1980 paper; Hashcash for denial of
    service counter-measures, published in 2002; and **proof-of-work** from Dwork
    and Naor’s 1993 paper.^([6](#fn_6)) Nakamoto brought these prior inventions together
    to create a peer-to-peer payment application, launched in 2009.

    white paper by Vitalik Buterin is based on Bitcoin—it’s mentioned 77 times. While
    clearly a fan of Bitcoin, Buterin noted that Bitcoin’s scripting language lacks
    Turing-completeness (among other limitations). By including a Turing complete
    programming language, Ethereum could serve as a platform to code and deploy new
    dApps. Buterin also sites Nick Szabo’s ideas; in addition to inventing Bit Gold,
    Szabo also developed the **smart contract** idea in 1998 and secure property ownership
    in 2005\. Combining these prior innovations to create something new, Buterin foresaw
    that three types of decentralized applications would run on Ethereum: financial
    applications; semi-financial applications; and governance applications like online
    voting. His white paper specifically mentions **decentralized autonomous organization
    (DAOs)** seven times, stable-value currencies one time and non-fungible assets
    once.^([7](#fn_7)) From the launch of Ethereum in 2015, we saw many seeds of Buterin’s

    Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs.^([9](#fn_9)) The combination

    that brings us to **metaverses**, which are virtual realities in which users interact
    with other users in computer-generated environments. The term ‘metaverse’ was
    first mentioned in a 1992 science fiction novel called ***Snow Crash*** by Neal
    Stephenson. Some people refer to ‘the’ metaverse (singular) while some people
    refer to metaverses (plural). When metaverse is used in singular form, it refers
    to the idea of ONE futuristic, universal, and interoperable virtual world, just
    as we have ONE physical world. Metaverses (plural) are where we are today, with
    multiple virtual worlds that cannot yet interact with one another, let alone exchange
    value, or transport your avatars, virtual goods, and virtual money across metaverses.
    But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s return to the foundational innovations
    that led to Web 3.0 versions of metaverses.

    of note. Second Life has centralized governance (owned and operated by Linden
    Lab) and has a centralized architecture. It is different from multi-player games
    because there are no organized games. Second Life may best be thought of as an
    ‘**Internet of Place’**. Users create digital representations of themselves called
    ‘avatars’, login, and then visit virtual places and interact with other avatars
    in those same virtual places (see first image in [Figure 12.2](#f_12_2)). Individuals
    are not charged to create avatars on the platform, but Linden Labs charges for
    its land. Second Life has the notion of digital assets. Second Life has its own
    digital money, called ‘Linden dollars’, for users to buy, sell, or rent land and
    goods. Linden Labs—as the benevolent dictator—has the power to ban users and to
    delete places. For example, Linden Labs deleted Woodbury University’s land from
    Second Life after users in the land behaved in a racist and harassing manner.^([10](#fn_10))
    Users interact with Second Life with a keyboard and mouse. In all, Second Life
    is a Web 2.0 version of a metaverse.

    content over physical surroundings, allowing users to be in virtual and physical
    worlds simultaneously. Pokémon Go, released in 2016, is an example (see left side
    of [Figure 12.3](#f_12_3)). In this game, users download the mobile app, create
    avatars, and use their mobile phone’s camera to overlay the virtual world to the
    user’s physical surroundings. When the app overlays a Pokémon character into the
    landscape, users try to capture Pokémon creatures by throwing virtual balls at
    them. The app is controlled and governed by Niantic, which earns revenues by selling
    advertisements.^([11](#fn_11)) Thus, Pokémon Go is another example of a Web 2.0

    whom do we trust with operating a metaverse? Do we trust centralized architectures
    where one or a few organizations control the nodes in the network, and thus the
    data and transactions or do we trust decentralized crowds of independent node
    operators? As far as governance, will we prefer the speed, efficiency, and clear
    accountability of centralized governance or the low abuse of power, inclusion,
    freedom, and privacy from decentralized governance? Before you answer, consider
    the economics. Most users are accustomed to free services from technology providers
    in exchange for the tech provider owning and monetizing our data. A major impediment
    to Web 3.0 decentralized governance is the lack of economic models—it’s hard to
    compete with free. Forbes contributor Alison McCauly wrote, *“Web3 communities
    are still looking for business models that reduce the cost of decentralization,
    which inherently shifts the expense of the network to the people who use it.”^([21](#fn_21))*
    Another economic challenge is the funding of software development. Meta invested
    $10 billion in metaverse development in 2021, and the user experience is much
    richer compared to Web 3.0 metaverses like Decentraland.

    trap that assumes everything must be fully transparent. Knowing that Web 3.0 provides
    a hybrid systems design approach that accounts for private data, defined multi-party

    Solutions do exist to protect privacy, private transactions, and in Web 3.0 to
    provide fully private transactions over a public blockchain substrate. A few different
    models leveraging some common approaches are maturing in this area. Layer 2 systems

    for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The point where those two data
    points intersect is when the demand for electric vehicles quickly passes the other
    line, and that is the moment when the demand for ICE vehicles is dropping quickly.
    Long before that happens, the automotive manufacturers must have ramped up EV

    big is indeed afoot. Blockchains have the potential to change the way we connect
    online (SSI), exchange value, and monetize our own data—just as the Internet changed
    the way we exchange information. Blockchains show us new ways to mitigate counter-party
    risks, to provide reliable bookkeeping records, and to secure networks by using
    cryptography, digital tokens, consensus algorithms, distributed ledgers, and smart
    contracts. In our opinion, it’s not just a pipedream; it’s already a $1 to $2
    trillion dollar industry. Public blockchains like Bitcoin have over a decade of
    operations without its ledger being hacked—that’s quite remarkable considering
    it stores up to nearly a trillion dollars’ worth of value (depending on the price
    of Bitcoin) and is OPEN to the public. When blunders like the 2016 Ethereum DAO
    attack occurs, we learn from them. Communities improve the technologies with each
    iteration of software development and upgrades.

- en: ^([27](#note_27)) *“In my Encyclical Letter on care for our common home, I pointed
    to a fundamental parallelism. The indisputable benefit that humanity will be able
    to draw from technological progress (cf. Laudato Si’, 102) depends on the degree
    to which the new possibilities at our disposal are employed in an ethical manner
    (cf. ibid., 105). This correlation requires an adequate development of responsibility
    and of values alongside the vast technological progress underway.”* His Holiness,
    Pope Francis. [https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2019/september/documents/papa-francesco_20190927_eradigitale.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2019/september/documents/papa-francesco_20190927_eradigitale.html)
