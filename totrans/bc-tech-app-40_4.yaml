    ledger technologies, with Bitcoin as the first one that made a breakthrough in
    this area. Over the years, in its initial design, blockchain technology was used
    in several applications in both financial and non-financial domains where, in
    the past, third party trusted entities for transactions’ verification and protection
    was necessary.

    for the automatic execution of contracts between involved parties was enforced
    by computer protocols. And yet, smart contracts did not come into use until blockchain
    technology enabled their easy registration, verification, and execution, that
    is, until programmable payments became a reality. Now, smart contracts, supported
    by blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies (e.g., hashgraph), that
    ensure payments are triggered when the preprogrammed conditions of the contract
    agreements are met, represent the cutting edge of the cryptocurrency world. The
    combination of smart contracts and distributed ledger technology enables many
    decentralized applications, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make up only
    a small part of the DLT ecosystem.

    exchanging anything that has value (money, shares, property, content, etc.). It
    is a self-operating program running on a DLT platform (e.g., on the Ethereum blockchain)
    that executes automatically when specific conditions are met. Due to the execution
    on a DLT platform, a smart contract runs exactly as programmed (according to the
    agreed contract terms), that is, there is no chance of it being changed, interrupted,
    censored, or interfered by any third party.

    node of the platform. In the case of a blockchain-supported smart contract, the
    execution of the smart contract code is part of the definition of the state transition
    function within the block validation algorithm. For example, if a transaction
    is part of a block that is to be validated, the code assigned to that transaction
    will be executed on all nodes, validating the given block.

    last decade is that AI-based solutions are increasingly deployed in the cars’
    autonomous driving systems. One typical example is avoiding sudden obstacles or
    incidents that may appear during autonomous driving. For that purpose, an artificial
    neural network (ANN) [[61](#b_9783110681130-005_ref_061)] implemented within a
    separate computer unit of a car can be trained based on the driving data collected
    when the car is driven in different environmental conditions. This training is
    performed for a longer period on different types of roads where various unexpected
    obstacles appear from time to time. Unfortunately, avoiding obstacles and surprises
    on the road still cannot be solved using standard systems of autonomous driving
    (radar, LIDAR [[62](#b_9783110681130-005_ref_062)], GPS, and different signal
    processing techniques). A well-trained ANN is expected to recognize almost all
    dangerous situations on the road that may happen during a real drive and act at
    the right time to avoid these situations. Additionally, the driving should be
    comfortable, assuming the absence of sudden braking, accelerations, or sharp direction
    changes (except in cases where a sharp direction change cannot be avoided). The
    most important trump card of autonomous driving is that safety and driving efficiency
    will be better than when a typical (average) human drives, and this goal has already
    been achieved in many situations. ANN training is similar to (but much shorter
    than) the process of teaching (or training) a person to drive. Additionally, once
    trained, the ANN can be implemented to all cars of the same model, without the
    necessity of training each car’s ANN separately [[63](#b_9783110681130-005_ref_063)].

    As Industry 4.0 is accelerating, robotics, together with digitalization and artificial
    intelligence, is fundamentally changing industrial production; the Industry 4.0
    strategy of leading car manufacturers relies on the digitalization of the entire
    value chain. Physical and digital processes are becoming increasingly interlaced,
    which lays the foundations for completely connected smart factories. With this
    concept, car production is also highly connected with customers, where customers’
    demands become guiding principles during the production of each car [[64](#b_9783110681130-005_ref_064)].

    assumes a faster response to global market changes and fluctuations as well as
    to customer demands. In contrast, greater efficiency means rational use of resources
    (e.g., energy, buildings, or material supplies). To achieve these goals, a smart
    factory should incorporate a completely digital process chain that exercises constant
    inventory control, which means that at any time and anywhere, each component in
    the (car) production process can be identified. Also, smart factory obtains control
    of production facilities from any place. Apart from flexible production processes,
    smart factory assumes simplified installation of new and modification of existing
    production facilities, which results in shorter innovation cycles, that is, product
    innovations can be transferred to more model series in a shorter time (time-to-market).

    operation can be estimated and clarified (i.e., précised) on the computer in advance
    – long before the start of mass production (of some car models). Thereby, many
    innovative procedures involving virtual reality and/or 3D printing may be introduced.
    For example, 3D printing may be used to create needed tools/objects (such as grip
    elements or protective covers needed in man-robot co-operation), rapid prototyping
    for sand-casting molds for engines, etc. Smart factories may also include machine
    learning in the production process. In such a case, a machine (i.e., a lightweight
    robot) can learn the path to be followed within the production process (when defined
    once) through a simple demonstration by a worker who leads the robot (as a senior
    worker in a factory would show all necessary steps of a given operation to a new

    electric cars’ batteries, a significant amount of cobalt may come from mines where
    child labor is exploited. In such and many other situations, blockchain and other

    validate it at any point using blockchain mechanisms. Similarly, as for software
    versioning, DLTs could help in tracking various documents’ releases. Using a distributed

    different tasks is regulated by the market, whereby, various agents/robots compete
    for tasks to be assigned and where the assignment of specific tasks to the appropriate
    agents is performed by distributed consensus, namely, a task-dispatching code
    stored in the blockchain (in the form of a smart contract) imposes a rollout in
    which a customer (or a specialized agent) first sends to the dispatcher of the
    smart contract, a request to perform a task, after which, the dispatcher informs
    the agents about the new request. Then, each of the concerned agents sends to
    the blockchain (via P2P network (see Fig. 4.1)) its agreement to perform the task
    with the information on the fee (e.g., in native tokens of the blockchain) the
    agent is ready to pay for handling the agreement. The blockchain validators then
    order the agreements received from agents according to the fees the agents offer.
    The first agreement, that is, the one with the highest fee offer is confirmed
    by the smart contract code, while the corresponding agent (the winner) receives
    details of the task that is to be executed.

    driving systems are significantly functional, for now. Self-driving cars can currently
    collect and process huge amounts of data from their environment every second so
    that they can successfully avoid barriers, find optimal paths in curves, optimize
    speed by the control of acceleration and braking, etc. However, the hardware used

    an intersection. Adding more cars into the equation increases the amount and the
    complexity of computations exponentially.

    a self-driving car cannot know and predict the behavior of the nearby cars (especially
    the ones coming from the front). So, as vehicles cannot trust each other, all
    autonomous cars must be prepared for the worst case at the intersection. The solution,
    which could bypass the problem, is the presence of a road-master – a central entity
    which decides what happens on the road and at what moment. Each car entering the
    intersection sends its current and desired location to the road-master, while
    the road-master calculates the next step of each car and orders some cars to move
    and others to wait. Even then, the problem of mistrust persists, since in some
    cases, cars might not obey the instructions (e.g., when a car is in a hurry due
    to an urgent situation or when the system is hacked). This is where blockchain
    (or some other DL) technology may be applied and help remove some of the trust
    issues.

    will be assured that no other car will ever cross its path, self-driven cars will
    not be paranoid . They will not have to analyze situations and act assuming the
    worst-case scenario every time they pass an intersection. Apart from that, due

    level of comfort in the house), the known daily schedule of the family members,
    and the weather forecast. It can reschedule some larger loads, such as charging
    a PEV, heating water, drying the clothes, etc. A distributed ledger is not required
    in this segment if the customer privately owns the home automation and the energy
    management system. A home gateway needs to link both in-house systems with a DL
    network for trusted interaction with other actors.

    can be bought or sold to the neighbors in the local district, namely, an organized
    cooperative which balances the demand and the distributed resources installed
    in the several households in the neighborhood. The exchange of electricity among
    the neighbors is recorded in a smart contract and cleared with the corresponding
    exchange for utility tokens. These can later be sold or reused to purchase electricity.

    larger prosuming actor. The aggregation is backed by a smart contract, too, and
    is entirely automated. There is no need for an aggregation service provider in
    terms of a legal or business entity. This reduces the operating costs of aggregation.
    Besides, scaling up the demand and supply enables them to participate more autonomously
    in the energy market. Aggregation into a larger entity offers them a better price
    negotiation position with the external electricity providers. The aggregating
    system can automatically negotiate with several power providers for the best electricity
    price. Smart contracts make the bidding and selection, and the result is verifiable
    by every involved party.

    of energy production elsewhere. In that case, the microgrid aggregator would receive
    an offer (in the form of a DL transaction) from the distribution or transport
    smart grid domains. It would then issue requests to acquire some of the energy
    from PEVs or local storage in the individual homes. The charging stations at customers’
    homes would estimate the amount of energy at their disposal based on the car battery
    status and foreseen travel plans derived from customers’ online calendars, and
    bid for sale. When the tertiary reserves are activated, the power provided in
    the emergency case has substantially higher prices than the regular. The benefits
    would be shared among the household involved, according to the rules in the smart
    contract.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several distinguishing aspects of smart grids affect the role and adoption of
    distributed ledger technology for the decentralized Energy Internet. Despite the
    successful introduction of ICT in the SG, grid systems remain relatively closed
    and centralized with regard to ownership and governance. However, this concept
    is gradually changing. Nevertheless, (smart) grid remains a critical infrastructure.
    It is mostly regulated and is characterized by an immense business perspective
    and possible financial implications. At the same time, it presents a highly distributed
    and heterogeneous system, especially in the customer domain. It is characterized
    by a large and dispersed customer base and by the various technologies for the
    communication connectivity needed for the communication flows of smart grid applications.
    Incessant connectivity of customer devices, for example, smart meters, cannot
    always be assumed. A blockchain architecture for the smart grid must, therefore,
    be able to balance between the availability and consistency of data in case network
    partitions are caused, for example, due to a temporary loss of communication connectivity.
    Such an architecture can, further, be hierarchical to match the hierarchical structure
    of the grid itself. The hierarchical structure of the blockchain data is also
    beneficial to limit the scope of data generated in various segments of the smart
    grid, for performance and privacy. Therefore, the DL networks for the Energy Internet
    are often implemented as hybrid blockchain networks or specialized public/consortium
    networks.

    for energy trading, certificate exchange, or loyalty and incentive programs. There
    are decentralized platform providers that are specialized in Energy Internet.
    Their products are reaching a level of maturity required for a broader and large-scale
    adoption of decentralized solutions. Often, lack of regulations is a more limiting
    factor for adoption than technology.

    and reduce electricity costs. Unlike the traditional central power plants, they
    are highly distributed. Renewable energy resources depend on unpredictable factors
    such as the weather and are, therefore, heavily volatile in energy production.
    DERs usually belong to different proprietors. To be more efficient, they can be
    aggregated in microgrids. Microgrids are clusters of jointly managed DERs located
    in proximity. They can be organized as a cooperative, which balances the demand
    and the supplies of the distributed resources installed in several households
    in a district, and trades the excessive energy production. Peer-to-peer energy
    trading is one of the keys to such a balance. Even if a microgrid is not fully
    self-sustainable, P2P trading reduces the dependence on central power resources
    and reduces electricity costs.

    that the consumption matches the actual production in a green plant. However,
    these energy attribute certificate (EAC) markets are frequently fragmented and
    lack a value for cross-market exchange. But, global markets are needed here, including

    metering infrastructure, which is readily deployed in modern energy grids. AMI
    measures, collects, and analyzes energy usage. A smart meter has a two-way communication
    channel, usually assured by power-line communications (PLC), or mobile (e.g.,
    LTE/5 G), or low-power mobile (e.g., NB-IoT), or long-range WAN networks (e.g.,
    LoRaWAN). Apart from consumption recording, AMI may support demand-side optimization
    or outage management too. Smart meters usually do not have unique digital decentralized
    identifiers and are simple transaction issuers (see Section 3.5.2). Instead, all
    blockchain functions are provided by AMI gateways or even by the backend blockchain
    platforms. This enables reuse of the installed metering infrastructure, but BC
    identification at the level of individual meters could yield a far more accurate,
    verifiable, and efficient process. An early demonstration was Bankymoon’s prepaid
    smart meter. It was a Bitcoin-based billing system for smart meters that operated
