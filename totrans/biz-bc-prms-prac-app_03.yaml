    applications manageability, and certainly security. Then, Netscape introduced
    the famous all-in-one “Netscape Application Server,” an integrated suite of software

    That simplification was a boon for programmers who took to it like ducks to water,

    A fundamental paradigm shift that regulators will need to come to grips with is
    that trust is now more open, and “free from central controls” who they typically
    regulated. The nature of trust is changing, but regulators are used to regulating
    the “trust providers.” Will they learn to adjust when the trust provider is a
    blockchain, or a new type of intermediary that didn’t fit the previous model of
    central choke point regulation? Specifically, the blockchain is decentralized
    by default, so it’s more difficult to regulate decentralized entities than central
    ones. Therefore, we will need to see innovation in regulations. Maybe blockchains
    can get certified for example.

    of the automobile industry, but they were thought of after years of observation
    and experience. Imagine if regulators demanded automatic daylight sensors or inflatable
    air bags in 1910, two years following the Ford Model T introduction. Not only
    were these needs not thought of; even the basic technology behind these capabilities
    wasn’t yet invented. The lesson here is that we do not really know what we need
    to regulate when a new technology is in its infancy of adoption.
