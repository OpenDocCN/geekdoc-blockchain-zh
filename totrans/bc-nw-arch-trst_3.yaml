    BitGold, a predecessor to Bitcoin that shares several of its attributes. He invented
    the concept of smart contracts in the 1990s. His libertarian politics match those
    in Satoshi’s writings, and his eclectic blog shows a fascination with the history
    of money. Speculating on whether Szabo or anyone else is the real Satoshi is something
    of a parlor game, but Szabo clearly appreciates the foundations of blockchain
    systems as well as anyone.

    to identify where the “dry code” of smart contracts can match the functions of
    the “wet code” of legal practice. This is one illustration of how cryptographic
    mechanisms and the law can be connected to build effective distributed ledger
    solutions. Governance by code alone has serious limitations, as we have seen.

    A safe harbor excludes certain activities from legal obligations. When firms can
    take sufficient steps to police themselves, a safe harbor incentivizes them to
    do so. It also defines what specific conduct is necessary. Perhaps the best-known
    safe harbors in the technology world are § 230 of the Telecommunications Act of
    1996 and § 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.^([5](#chapter10-5))
    Both shield online intermediaries from liability for content flowing across their
    systems. Section 230 says that online services will not be treated as publishers,
    meaning that they are generally not liable for content created by their users.
    Section 512 offers similar protection for copyright infringement, so long as the
    online platforms take down infringing material when notified.

    Internet, is problematic. They can make it difficult to restrict clearly harmful
    activity, such as online harassment, because the intermediaries have no incentive
    to take an active role. On the other hand, the twin safe harbors from the 1990s
    were a significant factor in the rapid growth of Internet-based applications.
    They were particularly important to the spread of user-driven Web 2.0 services
    and social media. The safe harbors encourage innovation by giving services the
    assurance that they will not face crushing liability for user-generated content.

    the same way that the *New York Times* considers what to put on its front page.
    And to the extent that there are technical means of policing content, they will
    more likely be deployed if service providers have immunity. Otherwise, their steps
    to regulate content will open them up to more liability every time something slips
    through the cracks. The safe harbors, therefore, create an online content environment

    of the concerns about the Internet safe harbors is that they were designed to

    tokens (which is treated as a regulated security offering) from the distribution

    Regulation D or Regulation Crowdfunding, two of the exceptions to the registration
    requirements for securities offerings. These come with significant limitations.
    A Regulation D offering can be made available only to accredited investors (those
    verified to have more than $1 million in net worth, or income in excess of $200,000
    individually or $300,000 for a household). A Regulation Crowdfunding offering
    can only raise slightly more than $1 million. Filecoin’s success at attracting
    huge sums of capital despite the accreditation hurdle suggests that these are
    not insurmountable restrictions, but they do move away from the concept of ICOs
    as a global fund-raising tool that gives all individuals freedom to invest in
    new instruments. A significant chunk of Filecoin’s funding, and that raised through
    other major SAFTs, came from venture capitalists and hedge funds granted preferential
    terms.

    and Exchange Commission (SEC) made clear in its Munchee enforcement action, a
    token can still constitute a security even if it has utility for a cryptocurrency
    application. Issuers who rushed to employ the SAFT have had to reconsider what
    happens when the initial purchasers seek a return on their investment. As the
    SEC offers further guidance on ICOs, different standardized contracts could replace
    the SAFT as the favored tool.

    the cryptographic hash string of the computer code, which guaranteed that it was
    referencing the proper smart contract. In parallel, the smart contract included
    the cryptographic hash string of the legal contract text. Thus, the two were definitively

    For example, a call option to buy a security at a certain price can be executed
    algorithmically on the blockchain, with payment made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.
    The blockchain, however, does not know stock prices. That information must be
    provided to the smart contract through an external connection, either to an automated
    data source or a human arbiter. Those external sources are called “oracles.”^([35](#chapter10-35))
    Some oracles are just traditional data feeds designed with interfaces for smart
    contracts to process them in an automated way. Thompson Reuters, one of the largest
    business publishing firms, is making some of its data feeds available in a manner
    designed to function as smart-contract oracles.^([36](#chapter10-36)) Oraclize

    Consider a simple smart contract in which each of the parties has a private key
    and a third key is given to an expert arbitrator. The smart contract requires
    two of three keys in order to execute, known as a “multiple signature (multisig)”
    arrangement. If the parties agree that the contract has been fully performed,
    they provide their keys and the smart contract executes. If there is a dispute,
    the parties turn to an arbitrator, who either provides a key along with that of
    the party seeking to enforce the contract, or refuses it, therefore preventing
    completion of the transaction. The system has just mimicked a legal arbitration
    process.

    get the bond back if the market is legitimate. (Those who wish to bet on the outcome
    of the prediction do so in ether or some other cryptocurrency.) A randomly selected
    group of “reporters”—analogous to a jury—is tasked with verifying the outcome.
    Those reporters must also post a REP bond. The reports can be challenged, and

    incorrect information loses her or his bond.^([47](#chapter10-47))

    a reporter to decide than whether it is factually correct. The risk of losing
    REP if their decision is successfully challenged may make reporters shy about
    selecting the “undeterminable/unethical” option. And those two categories are
    actually quite different from one another. At minimum, though, Augur’s system

    By greatly increasing confidence that what Internet users saw on their screens
    were actually legitimate sites, TLS formed a basis for mainstream trust in e-commerce.
    Standing behind TLS is public key infrastructure (PKI). As discussed in connection
    with the DigiNotar incident in chapter 4, PKI is a centralized trust architecture.
    A website is trustworthy if it has the proper certificate. It obtains that certificate
    from an organization called a “certificate authority (CA),” which signs it with
    its own cryptographic private key. The CA may, in turn, gain authority from a

    they are transacting with directly. And because TLS is a point-to-point security
    protocol, it is not optimized for end-to-end trust. Similarly, the intermediaries
    and platforms control the identity and rating systems. Identities and ratings

    records the way that Google owns its database of search queries. Moreover, the
    software for these networks, as well as for major permissioned-ledger projects
    such as Hyperledger and R3, is open source. That means that anyone can take it

    blockchain openness. The reason that dominant Internet platforms soaked up so
    much of the value in online activity is economic as much as technical. Facebook
    sits between users looking to interact and advertisers looking to market to them.
    In 2017, it generated more than $30 billion in revenue from these interactions.
    Users provide the data and attention that feeds this profit machine, but they
    receive none of the financial benefits. Network effects help to lock in Facebook’s
    control. A competitor, even one offering a far superior service, cannot offer
    the same value proposition because what people want is access to their friends.

    be used to monetize that ownership value. For example, the Inter Planetary File
    System (IPFS) offers a blockchain-based, distributed cloud-storage technology.
    Instead of storing files in a particular location, accessible through a uniform
    resource locator (URL) address, IPFS stores multiple copies of files, in pieces,
    across many hard drives throughout the network. It is designed to use the Filecoin
    token to incentivize users to contribute storage space. The token provides the
    intermediation by establishing incentives on both sides, analogous to the way
    that Google brings together advertisers and viewers. Those who upload files contribute
    tokens (which they can purchase for other currencies) and those who store them
    earn tokens. IPFS, the company, provides the technology, but it has no control
    over the content stored on the network. And the value of the tokens depends on
    supply and demand.

    which makes it so difficult for a new platform to get to scale.^([46](#chapter11-46))
    With the ICO model, projects may have easier access to capital because they can
    tap into individuals around the world rather than the small collection of early-stage
    venture capitalists and angel investors. Their investors receive something of
    potentially immediate value—tokens that can either be used for services on the
    platform or translated into other currencies through exchanges. And if a protocol
    takes off, those tokens still belong to the purchasers. The platform cannot centralize
    the value creation in the way Facebook does.

    by ICOs since 2016 was from investors simply looking to get rich from projects
    that they did not intend to participate in, and often did not understand. The
    absence of regulation allowed some offerings to stack the deck against ordinary
    investors, not to mention engage in outright scams. And the blockchain does not
    necessarily overcome the incumbency benefits of existing intermediaries. There
    is no reason to think that a distributed Facebook competitor would be any more
    successful built on a distributed ledger than previous efforts such as Google+
    and Diaspora were. Steem.it, a blockchain-based online discussion network that
    lets users reward high-quality content using cryptocurrency, is a nice proof of

    is possible to verify the truth of a claim—such as whether someone has more than
    $100,000 in liquid net worth or is over twenty-one years old—without actually
    storing that private information on the blockchain. Such verified claims would,
    for example, allow a prospective lender to obtain a financial transaction history,
    while a prospective employer would get verification of any educational degrees
    earned, but no data that was not necessary for the transaction at hand. Users
    could create a different key pair for each business relationship, so the theft
    of one would not expose other information. Government agencies are starting to
    support these development efforts as a way to combat fraud, inefficiencies, and
    security breaches such as the recent hacks into the Office of Personnel Management

    in the blockchain world. As a senior engineer at Google’s office in Zurich, Switzerland,
    he worked on systems such as Google Maps and Gmail. He discovered Bitcoin in 2009,
    a few months after the release of Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, and immediately
    began exchanging email with him about how the network might scale. He soon began
    contributing to the Bitcoin development project. Eventually, he quit his lucrative
    job at Google to work on Bitcoin full time as one of the small group of Bitcoin
    core developers.

    in which self-driving cars used a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO),
    which he called TradeNet, to find riders and bid for space on roads. No one would
    own the cars. They would own themselves and be programmed to maximize productivity,
    including investing in the creation of new cars when their revenues exceeded costs,
    all without human intervention or central management. Another entity, MatterNet,
    would coordinate the delivery of physical objects through autonomous quadcopters.
    All of this could be implemented through smart contracts. New arrangements built
    around cryptocurrencies might replace not only the financial system, but also
    taxation as a means of funding the creation of public goods.

    to improve performance. He was frustrated at other core developers who blocked
    these efforts, in particular a proposed fork called Bitcoin XT. At the same time,
    Bitcoin mining power had consolidated into a few pools. Hearn’s conclusion was
    that Satoshi’s grand experiment in decentralization had come to an end: “What
    was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important

    than a blockchain structure; and does away with the native cryptocurrency entirely.
    Advocates of public blockchains dismiss permissioned systems such as Corda as
    uninteresting. They are, they say, just a tool for existing enterprises to operate

    decentralization, Bitcoin had become a centrally controlled system, and a poorly
    managed one at that. Whether history judges him prescient or a fool for declaring
