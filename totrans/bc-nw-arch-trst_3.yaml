    he is commonly identified as the mysterious creator of Bitcoin.^([1](#chapter10-1))
    Szabo, an experienced cryptographer and information-security researcher, created
    BitGold, a predecessor to Bitcoin that shares several of its attributes. He invented
    the concept of smart contracts in the 1990s. His libertarian politics match those
    in Satoshi’s writings, and his eclectic blog shows a fascination with the history

    The fact that smart contracts can function without the machinery of legal enforcement
    does not make the law irrelevant. It means that developers should study the law
    to identify where the “dry code” of smart contracts can match the functions of
    the “wet code” of legal practice. This is one illustration of how cryptographic
    mechanisms and the law can be connected to build effective distributed ledger
    solutions. Governance by code alone has serious limitations, as we have seen.
    Law has its own flaws. Successful systems will need to draw from both.

    A safe harbor excludes certain activities from legal obligations. When firms can
    take sufficient steps to police themselves, a safe harbor incentivizes them to
    do so. It also defines what specific conduct is necessary. Perhaps the best-known
    safe harbors in the technology world are § 230 of the Telecommunications Act of
    1996 and § 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.^([5](#chapter10-5))
    Both shield online intermediaries from liability for content flowing across their
    systems. Section 230 says that online services will not be treated as publishers,
    meaning that they are generally not liable for content created by their users.

    online platforms take down infringing material when notified.

    were a significant factor in the rapid growth of Internet-based applications.

    the same way that the *New York Times* considers what to put on its front page.
    And to the extent that there are technical means of policing content, they will
    more likely be deployed if service providers have immunity. Otherwise, their steps
    to regulate content will open them up to more liability every time something slips
    through the cracks. The safe harbors, therefore, create an online content environment

    get the bond back if the market is legitimate. (Those who wish to bet on the outcome
    of the prediction do so in ether or some other cryptocurrency.) A randomly selected
    group of “reporters”—analogous to a jury—is tasked with verifying the outcome.
    Those reporters must also post a REP bond. The reports can be challenged, and

    incorrect information loses her or his bond.^([47](#chapter10-47))

    数字经济的成功增长需要在互联网之上发展一个信任层。
- en: In the early days of e-commerce, many users refused to transact because they
    were afraid that their credit cards and other information would be stolen. The
    primary technical response was a security protocol, Transport Level Security (TLS),
    which verifies the connection between a user’s browser and a website’s server.^([14](#chapter11-14))
    By greatly increasing confidence that what Internet users saw on their screens
    were actually legitimate sites, TLS formed a basis for mainstream trust in e-commerce.
    Standing behind TLS is public key infrastructure (PKI). As discussed in connection
    with the DigiNotar incident in chapter 4, PKI is a centralized trust architecture.
    A website is trustworthy if it has the proper certificate. It obtains that certificate
    from an organization called a “certificate authority (CA),” which signs it with
    its own cryptographic private key. The CA may, in turn, gain authority from a
    higher-level CA.

  zh: 2013年，赫恩在爱丁堡的图灵音乐节上做了一场令人震撼的演讲，内容关于基于区块链的自主代理。他预见了一个世界，在这个世界里，自动驾驶汽车使用一个去中心化的自治组织（DAO），他称之为TradeNet，来寻找乘客并竞标道路空间。没有人会拥有这些汽车。它们会拥有自己，并被编程为最大化生产力，包括当它们的收入超过成本时投资新汽车的生产，这一切都不需要人类干预或集中管理。另一个实体，MatterNet，将协调通过自主四旋翼无人机交付实体物品。所有这些都可以通过智能合约实现。围绕加密货币建立的新安排可能会取代不仅是金融系统，甚至是税收作为创造公共产品的手段。

    time, the Bitcoin community was still largely a collection of volunteer software
    developers and digital cash enthusiasts. Vitalik Buterin had not yet proposed
    Ethereum. Paul Vigna and Michael Casey, in their book *The Age of Cryptocurrency*,
    call Hearn’s talk “the most far-reaching forecast of [the] potential in blockchain
    technology.”^([2](#chapter12-2)) Hearn was the visionary who appreciated the blockchain’s

    赫恩是早期就认识到区块链具有彻底变革潜力而有远见的预言家。
- en: 'Given his enthusiasm, therefore, it was a shock when, two and a half years
    later, Mike Hearn publicly declared in an extraordinary blog post that Bitcoin
    had failed. He was ceasing his involvement in Bitcoin development and selling
    all his bitcoin. Hearn was a strong advocate of increasing the Bitcoin block size
    to improve performance. He was frustrated at other core developers who blocked
    these efforts, in particular a proposed fork called Bitcoin XT. At the same time,
    Bitcoin mining power had consolidated into a few pools. Hearn’s conclusion was
    that Satoshi’s grand experiment in decentralization had come to an end: “What
    was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important
    institutions’ and ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system
    completely controlled by just a handful of people.”^([3](#chapter12-3))'

    core 开发者感到沮丧，尤其是对一个名为比特币 XT 的拟议分叉。与此同时，比特币挖矿力量已经集中到几个池中。赫恩的结论是，中本聪的去中心化伟大实验已经结束：“本来应该是一种新的、去中心化的货币，缺乏‘系统重要机构’和‘太大而不能倒’的特征，但现在更糟：一个完全由少数人控制的系统。”^([3](#chapter12-3))
- en: 'At the root of the conflict was a disagreement about the relationship of scaling
    and decentralization. Hearn’s nemesis among the core developers, Greg Maxwell,
    argued that as the Bitcoin network supported more activity on-chain, a few large
    corporations would be the only ones that would be able to operate the network
    nodes.^([4](#chapter12-4)) Hearn believed the opposite: growth was the only way

    赫恩相信恰恰相反：增长是打破矿工和 core 开发者寡头的唯一途径。^([5](#chapter12-5))
- en: Whatever the technical merits of the particular proposals for Bitcoin scaling,
    this debate implicates the themes at the heart of this book. The traditional understanding
    is that trusted systems must either be small enough for interpersonal peer-to-peer
    (P2P) trust or give up power to the Leviathan of centralized authority or to dominant
    intermediaries. What Hearn perceived was that distributed ledgers allowed a third
    option. They created a common truth without assuming the trustworthiness of any
    central actor. The blockchain’s trust architecture offered the solution to the
    very problem Bitcoin was experiencing.

- en: 'Yet there was a catch, which lurked in Hearn’s earlier visionary explorations.
    In his 2013 Turing Festival talk, Hearn recognized that the most powerful applications
    of the blockchain created a public goods problem. A self-organizing marketplace
    of self-managed, autonomous vehicles would be superior to the status quo in every
    way but one: no one could own it, so who would be incentivized to build it? Hearn
    suggested assurance contracts, under which developers would be compensated automatically,
    but only once a threshold of support or implementation was reached.^([6](#chapter12-6))'

  zh: 然而，这里有一个隐藏在Hearn早期富有远见的探索中的问题。在2013年的图灵节讲座中，Hearn认识到区块链最强大的应用创造了一个公共品问题。一个自我组织的、由自主车辆管理的市场将会在各个方面都优于现状，但有一点除外：没有人能够拥有它，那么谁会有动力去建设它呢？Hearn建议使用保证合同，在这种合同下，开发者会自动获得补偿，但只有在获得一定程度的支持或实施后才会发生。^([6](#chapter12-6))
- en: 'Crowdfunding services such as Kickstarter use this approach to great effect.
    However, the mechanism still requires someone to define the rules and objectives
    for the contract. For most of the assurance contracts that economists theorize,
    that entity is assumed to be the government—the very thing that Bitcoin was created
    to escape. Even if a private actor makes the rules, it needs some legitimate mechanism
    to create and enforce them. This brings us back to Vili’s Paradox of governance:
    The mechanisms to make decentralized systems effective seemingly make them no
    longer decentralized.'

    2017, with the implementation of Segwit and the price of bitcoin many times what

    Hearn wrong. “There are some individuals like Hearn that are not capable of understanding

    Corda’s network is permissioned, where Bitcoin is public; transmits information
    only between transacting parties, where Bitcoin broadcasts the full ledger to
    all; employs familiar relational databases for its information stores, rather
    than a blockchain structure; and does away with the native cryptocurrency entirely.
    Advocates of public blockchains dismiss permissioned systems such as Corda as
    uninteresting. They are, they say, just a tool for existing enterprises to operate
    a bit more efficiently, rather than a means to restructure markets. Hearn is widely
    reviled among Bitcoin true believers for wrongly declaring Bitcoin a failure and

    because someone always has to decide who can operate on the network. The fact

    dichotomy. Hearn left Bitcoin because he believed that for all the rhetoric of
    decentralization, Bitcoin had become a centrally controlled system, and a poorly
    managed one at that. Whether history judges him prescient or a fool for declaring
    the Bitcoin experiment a failure in January 2016, his story illustrates that significant
