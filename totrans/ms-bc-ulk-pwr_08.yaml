    raised $133 million in 2018 from prominent venture capitalists. Its aim was to
    create a decentralized token by creating incentives for traders to buy and sell
    what were referred to as *bond* and *share* tokens. This would then provide a
    stable asset for the market that could be utilized globally for a number of use
    cases, including applications in the developing world, crowdfunding, and exchange

    being a US-based company launching a stablecoin. This included the bond and share
    tokens being recognized as securities by the SEC. In addition, KYC rules would

    After looking at several options, including centralizing the system, the project
    shut down and returned funding to its investors. It’s a common mentality in Silicon
