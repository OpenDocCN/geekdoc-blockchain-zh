- en: Technology is becoming an indispensable part of our lives. It plays an important
    role in health, banking, and education. Organizations have started adopting these
    technological developments to satisfy customer needs. The rise of the Over-the-Top
    (OTT) digital platforms has created an economic platform in which the digital
    content, services, and offerings are facilitated by intermediaries and has changed
    the way of interaction. The blockchain serves as a means for creating a digital
    platform by creating trust among the intermediaries. Organizations should carry
    out innovative technology practices to be successful in a competitive environment.
    This chapter examines the gap between blockchain platforms and the role of the
    digital transformation process. It thereby provides researchers a holistic approach
    for studying the impact of blockchain on OTT platforms.

- en: Over-the-Top (OTT) is a term used in the media industry when TV is used to reach
    individuals’ homes through physical links and boxes, and advanced content was
    conveyed through the web 'over the top' of the links and boxes. OTT has two products,
    the content and the viewers or the subscribers. Data collected from various locations
    is processed using Big Data analytics for enhancing and improving the customer
    viewing experience. Compared with steady competition from traditional television,
    the future of OTT platforms across the world looks bright.Traditional TV has started
    innovating by adapting to newer technologies to reach out to a wider range of
    audiences. Over the last decade, traditional TV has

    AIB Research states that the video market across the world will keep on increasing
    at a fast pace with over-the – Top (OTT). By 2022, the OTT market will produce
    massive revenue of $51.4 billion with a surge CGAR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
    of 10%. Subscribers will enjoy most of the benefits of OTT provided if they subscribe
    to the OTT platforms. In countries like North America and Europe, TV channel broadcasters
    are providing OTT services to their customers to withhold them consistently. Virtual
    Multichannel Video Programming (vMVPD) is provided at relatively cheaper prices
    to all the subscribers [[1](#c9r1)]. Globally, the number of subscribers opting
    for OTT is increasing when there has been a decline in traditional TV. The Average
    Revenue per User (ARPU) for pay channels is expected to go down four times, probably
    by 2022\. Thus, there is no doubt that OTT players are marching towards increasing
    their revenue by adding more number of subscribers. Amazon, Apple, DAZN, Facebook,
    Google, and Netflix have started investing in setting up their own production
    houses. There is a great demand for content in OTT platforms owned by broadcasters,
    going ahead to have deals between broadcasters and OTT providers [[2](#c9r2)].

    (in 2018) to $149.7 (in 2024), making it with an increase of 15.8% in compound
    annual growth rate (CAGR) [[4](#c9r4)]. Indian users are more inclined to freely
    available content than subscription platforms. Keeping this in mind, OTT players
    have come up with a pay-per-user model called subscription-based video on demand
    (SVOD) business models on a monthly or yearly basis. Simultaneously, many OTT
    players are trying to promote advertising – based on the video on demand (AVOD),
    while other OTT players are adhering to free business models and planning them
    to convert into paid users. A blockchain describes an ever-growing set of shared,
    maintained, digital records and verified by several participants. There is a myriad
    of blockchain species, but this one definition is suitable for most scenarios
    [[5](#c9r5), [6](#c9r6)]. Each set of digital records in a blockchain is grouped
    into dependent blocks in order. This means that attempting to modify a transaction
    in any block would usually require modifying all of the following blocks, a computation-intensive
    task that is economically feasible by design, taking into account a new block
    is added within minutes. This process makes the data more sure and as time goes
    by, more blocks are added. Since this unique record set is maintained continuously
    in several places or distributed, it is highly fault tolerant; there is no central
    party that attacks, shuts down, coerced, or (in many cases) sues [[7](#c9r7)].
    This decentralization is absolutely essential to do this work; a blockchain 100%
    owned by a single entity provides barely incremental benefit. Blockchain technology
    owes its origin to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Ensuring consent around a permanent
    digital ledger without the participation of a trusted central authority was needed
    (such as a bank, e-payment provider, or government) in order to create “digital
    currency” [[8](#c9r8), [9](#c9r9)]. Without an authoritative party to keep the
    register, you had to design something really innovative so that someone couldn't
    copy and paste the way they spend their digital money twice. This feature of blockchain
    technology, or the ability to have a unique and truly owned digital resource,
    is a vitally important characteristic for brands and marketers. The “digital scarcity”
    of the blockchain technology not only supports the value of Bitcoin, but it also
    provides brands with a real bridge between the finite physical world and a numerically
    infinite world. Many companies see blockchain as an open platform [[10](#c9r10)].
    Open blockchains, like those that support Bitcoin cryptocurrency and Ethereum
    network, rely on a new model to make up for the lack of a trusted broker. On the
    other hand, with their exploration of closed or “authorized” blockchains, financial
    institutions are fall to the top to adopt a technology that an anonymous individual
    or group invented to help render these institutions useless after the 2008 crash.
    Even in this digitally sterile implementation, banks can enjoy advantages such
    as quick settlement times and more quickly agreed trade finance terms by inheriting
    at least some of the characteristics of an open blockchain, such as immutability
    and decentralization.

    gradually to be recognized as a game-changer for many industries such as the service,
    financial, and manufacturing sectors [[11](#c9r11)]. Due to its specific features
    such as privacy, security, smart contracts, scalability, and the ability to resolve
    file double-spending problems, the need to make SCM more efficient becomes essential.
    The BC implementation improves the transaction between two or multiple parties
    in terms of confidentiality, monitoring, transparency, and enforceability in smart
    contracts. Long-term use of BC technology makes the SC system more energy-efficient,
    affordable, and oriented towards high performance. The application of BC technology
    can be used to improve efficiency and efficient use of resources and this latest
    technology help establish a CSS. British Columbia is an emerging technology and
    researchers and industry professionals seek to implement British Columbia in the
    field of SC. This technology is in its early stages and so far limited work has

    Our society should evolve towards 2030 as a more digital, data-driven, and intelligent
    solution-inspired society, which needs an almost instantaneous wireless connectivity.
    So several novel applications that provide such interaction and integration are
    destined to emerge in the next decade. Like, some key trends that should emerge
    in the near future are: virtual and augmented reality, 8K video streaming, holograms,
    remote surgery, industry 4.0, smart homes, fog computing, integrated artificial
    intelligence services, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous vehicles, to name
    a few. These, in turn, will ask for much more mobile networks in terms of reliability,
    latency, and higher data rates than 5G [[13](#c9r13)]. For providing video streaming,
    over-the–Top (OTT) services overlap with complementary software solutions like
    the quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS). Most OTT vendors
    have their proprietary software and use a combination of servers, networks, and
    intelligent software to determine the quality of services in real-time [[14](#c9r14)].
    Consumers demand watching personalized videos from a variety of content available
    to them on their own devices at their convenient time. OTT platforms have revolutionized
    to satisfy consumer demands. The videos that are watched on OTT platforms will
    be a revenue-generating model. Growth in GDP per capita increases with the increase
    in the number of smartphone users, *etc.* that would ultimately make the OTT market
    increase its revenue. OTT has some challenges to overcome like piracy, censorship,
    and low internet speed, *etc.*'

- en: Over the years, the number of subscriptions for OTT platforms grew to 285% worldwide.
    Netflix was the top application rated by the annual consumer during the period
    2016 to 2019\. The launch of Disney+ has also added further revenue to this market.
    When compared with other countries, India has the highest number of consumers
    using OTT platforms. During the year 2018-2019, OTT platforms played a vital role
    in India. TV content has been the greatest classification of utilization in the
    course of the last year. There is no negative development in TV viewing till today;
    hence get up to speed seeing is probably the most grounded guarantee of OTT contributions.
    Live streaming has attracted many consumers during the cricket seasons and even
    some shows like “Game of Thrones”. Television broadcasters have come up with new
    weapons that streamed the live content on their OTT platforms. The live streaming
    of the content has attracted many consumers. Occasions like elections and terrorist
    attacks created a huge demand in the OTT platforms. Video content consumption
    in OTT platforms has created a demand for more live and content-based aspects.
    However, there is no censor board for videos in OTT platforms like special shows,
    *etc.* have violence and vulgar contents that can be streamed in OTT but can not
    be telecasted on TV. Indian platforms like ALTBalaji have attracted many consumers.
    Apart from ALTBalaji, Netflix and Amazon too attracted many Indian viewers. Another
    important aspect of OTT platforms is that the platforms are trying to strengthen
    their video content dependent on the existing library that was aired on TV. India
    has many channels, contributing countless long periods of video content consistently.
    Content has demonstrated its value on one stage, is syndicated to another stage,
    hence reiterated content is still sought after. Content is streaming all over
    the stages, and customers are continuously exploring all the available platforms
    of their choice. There is a demand for newly added videos. The video content produced
    originally will define the growth of the particular OTT. With internet access
    becoming cheaper, more people are showing interest in OTT platforms; particularly
    the semi-urban and rural areas have access to content. The majority of these consumers
    are subscribers of OTT. In today’s scenario, even rural and non-urban viewers
    are also showing interest in OTT. A combination of regional content will guarantee
    an AVOD platform for local markets. If any OTT provider provides the regional
    content, then they will be the game changer in OTT platforms in the Indian market.
    The content environment for OTT stages started developing in 2018 with the concurrence
    of publicly supported content, free content, and studio-created content, film
    content, and TV content. The Indian market is providing more entrants to provide
    more content similar to TV. The majority of the consumers on OTT platforms worldwide
    are Indian consumers. FM Radio has been delivering music for decades and providing
    music on the go. The emerging OTT platforms have started keeping the younger consumers
    engaged with their high consumption. The content market is anticipating a major
    change. Many OTT platforms are keen on delivering specials that were split into
    episodes that are trying to attract more subscribers. Gaming and live content
    streams are developing; the rise of tech-driven content like nonlinear content,
    intuitive accounts, different stage stories, and vivid content will be explored
    by the OTT content makers in the future. Globally, all the OTT players are trying
    to provide curated content based on viewer choices. As a result, major players
    have started investing to build a content pipeline. The investments of Netflix
    are 3x more than the investments made by Amazon and Hulu (BCG December 2018).
    The normal cash spent on content for OTT platforms is higher than the TV markets
    in India. Time spent on Video Streaming Apps globally went up 140% in 2018 versus
    2016 in countries like Australia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand
    (App Annie, The state of the mobile 2019). Table ([**2**](#c9t2)) shows the OTT
    Platform revenue generation model. Table ([**3**](#c9t3)) shows the list of OTT

    more on advertising. Each organization will make plans of action which suit their
    business needs. For ensuring secure, transparent, and immutable transactions,
    a cryptocurrency uses blockchain technology. BC is a secure and distributed ledger
    that shares the copy of the ledger with each participating node [[21](#c9r21)].
    Blockchain plans of action help improve organizations and advantage end clients.

    visionaries. Blockchain business thoughts must capacity successfully both at the
    large scale and smaller scale level, subsequently profiting the two workers and
    end-clients. For example, BloHosT (Blockchain-Enabled Smart Tourism and Hospitality
    Management) allows tourists to interact with various stakeholders through a single
    wallet identifier linked with a cryptocurrency server to initiate payments. BloHosT
    uses an immutable ledger, where no proofs are required during travelling, in this
    way it provides a hassle-free experience to tourists. A Tourism enabled Deep-Learning
    (TeDL) framework is used as a part of the BloHosT framework, which is trained
    on the experience of previously visited travelers. It provides rating scores to
    prospective travelers about the recently visited locations by previous travelers

    to another company [24]. After that, the wholesalers purchase the item from the
    producer and then selling either to customers or to a retailer. Wholesalers act
    as middlemen between manufacturers to the retail stores. Retailers get products
    from manufacturers either directly or *via*. a distributor. Retailers may operate
    countrywide or they could operate independently. They make it easy for customers
    to buy the products of their choice. The franchise is a combination of all the
    above business models. A franchise incorporates all the business procedures and
    protocols in it. Blockchain business models are given below.'
