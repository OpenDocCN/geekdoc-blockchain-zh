    is linked with the hash of the previous one. A block consists of a collection
    of transactions, time stamps and the hash of the previous block. Blockchain is
    a distributed ledger where transactions are stored in blocks and spread across
    a peer-to-peer network where every node holds a copy of the ledger. The value
    of cryptography hashing and a distributed ledger makes it more unique than other
    technologies in that it is highly secured and almost impossible to compromise.
    The transparency in information for every node or participant is a property of
    blockchain which shows information cannot be modified which reduces fraudulent
    data and tampering with data which helps in building trust. Blockchain is customizable
    where actions can be triggered once the contextual conditions are met. Blockchain
    works on a peer-to-peer network, and there is no third party or central authority
    involvement.

- en: Encryption is a base concept for blockchain. It can be seen as immutability
    of data which is also distributed. The history starts during the late 1970s when
    the concept of a Merkle tree was introduced which is a binary hash tree. The conceptual
    tree consists of a leaf node with a hash and every non-leaf node has a cryptographic
    hash of its child nodes. This helped in the secure verification of large data.
    This conceptual model was invented by Ralph Merkle in 1979\. In the early 1990s
    a blockchain-like technology was introduced by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta,
    working on secure blockchain. In 1992, documents could be stored in a single block
    with the help of the Merkle tree design. The actual inception of blockchain was
    conceptualized by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 when he introduced the peer-to-peer
    cash system. This triggered the launch of a currency in 2009 which is a digital
    cryptocurrency with an underlying layer of blockchain technology. The digital
    cryptocurrency known as “Bitcoin” came to existence. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the
    first Bitcoin. Hal Finney who was the programmer for Bitcoin was the first to
    receive 10 Bitcoins from Satoshi Nakamoto.

    a legitimate use of payments. This is the starting period where investors started
    focusing on this technology. This is the time when smart contracts and decentralized
    apps were conceptualized. This stepled to the realization of the benefit of running
    decentralized apps and smart contracts. Ethereum is a public blockchain developed
    in open source and decentralized whereas the cryptocurrency is named “Ether”.
    Ethereum with a smart contracting layer gave the advantage of including various
    parameters and also validating various levels over the transactions. This contracting
    layer also helped various parameters and improved upon the overall interactions
    on the transactions and contracts. Blockchain technology is transparent, secured
    and there is no third party or central authority intervention. It has the ability
    to make an organization that uses this technology more transparent, democratic,
    efficient, decentralized and secure. Within the next five to ten years blockchain
    will disrupt various industries. Some of the industries where blockchain has already
    started include banking services intended for those who have no access to the
    banking system that we use presently. Similarly Bitcoin allows users to send money.
    Barclays has already started using blockchain to some extent. Blockchain is used
    in supply chain management where users store data in decentralized locations and
    records are kept in a secured manner which provides various benefits like minimizing
    cost and labor. Some of the startup blockchain companies like Provenance, Fluent,
    Skuchain and Blockverify are working to improve supply chain management. In forecasting
    industries, blockchain is expected to change the traditional methods of research,
    consulting, forecasting and analysis. In networking and IoT, IBM and Samsung are
    using a new idea called “adapt” which will use blockchain technology and create
    a distributed network of IoT devices. In the insurance industry, the core is trust
    management. With the help of blockchain, technology ensured person identity. Blockchain
    can be used to verify many types of data in insurance contracts like the insured
    person’s identity. Blockchain smart contracts can be integrated with oracles bearing
    real data. A blockchain project called Aeternity is developing digital applications
    for the insurance industry. In private transport and the ride-sharing industry,
    blockchain technology is being used to create a platform for riders and owners
    where riders can access the services by meeting a mutual terms and condition without
    a central authority. Blockchain startups like Lazoos and Arcade City are working
    in this area. In the online data storage industry, blockchain allows storage to
    be more secure and robust against attacks. Storj is an example of decentralized
    cloud storage. In the charity industry, blockchain can be used to address inefficiencies
    and corruption. It can help to track that donations are going to the right hands.
    BitGive uses blockchain technology to receive funds using a distributed ledger.
    In voting, blockchain can be used for a number of services like the verification
    of identity, registration of voters and also counting the votes. It helps in counting
    only the legitimate votes, no votes are changed or moved, and creating an immutable,
    publicly viewable ledger will make a massive step forward to make elections more
    fair and democratic. Democracy Earth and Follow My Vote are aiming in this field
    to create a blockchain-based voting system. In the health care industry, blockchain
    is used to store and share sensitive data with authorized doctors and patients.
    This will help in data security and improve in accuracy and speed in diagnosis.
    Gem and Tierion are working in the health care data space. In the energy management
    industry, TransactiveGrid allows customers to buy and sell energy from each other
    in a decentralized way without involving the public grid or a trusted private
    intermediary. In online music, blockchain can be used by fans to pay musicians
    directly. Smart contracts can be introduced which can solve licensing issues and
    better catalog songs with their respective creators. Mycelia and Ujo are blockchain-based
    platforms made specifically for the music industry. In the retail industry, blockchain
    utilities creates a lobby where sellers and buyers meet and can deal as per the
    requirements without the intervention of a central authority. The two startups
    OpenBazaar and OB1 use blockchain in the retail space. In the real estate industry,
    some challenges can be overcome like lack of transparency, fraud, bureaucracy
    and mistakes in public records. Blockchain technology can help in reducing the
    need for documents, building accuracy and verifying ownership and also speeding
    up transactions. Ubiquity is a blockchain-based secured platform for real estate
    record keeping which is an alternative to legacy paper-based systems. In the crowdfunding
    industry, many organizations are benefited especially the startups by raising
    funds using blockchain smart contracts which eliminates the need for a third party.
    New projects can release their own tokens that can be later exchanged for services,
    cash or products.

    is protected. Blockchain is defined as a decentralized ledger of transactions
    over a peer-to-peer network. Blockchain offers secured and transparent transactions
    to all parties involved. The blockchain ledger records every sequence of transactions
    from beginning to end whether it is many or one. On each transaction, it is put
    into a block and each block is connected to the one before and after [[2](#re_TNF-CH006_CIT00002)].
    The lists of transactions are blocked together and the fingerprint of each block
    is added to the next, thus creating an irreversible chain. Blockchain works with
    all types of transactions, and it is distributed, permissioned and secured. A
    block usually consists of the current transaction information and hash of the
    previous block. A hash function takes any digital media and runs an algorithm
    on it to produce a fixed-length digital output known as a hash ([Figure 6.1](chapter6.xhtml#fig6.1)).

    bit of digital media is changed, the hash function also changes as compared to
    the original one. All blocks are numbered starting from 0\. The first block numbered
    0 is known as the genesis block.

- en: The distributed ledger nature of blockchain makes it more secure. The data are
    not stored on a centralized database but across a wide range of computers known
    as nodes. If any of the blocks is tampered with, it causes the hash of the block
    to change which will make all the subsequent blocks invalid. Nowadays computers
    and technology are pretty fast, say for example if any of the blocks is tampered
    with and all the subsequent block hash are recalculated, then there is a chance
    the blockchain will be compromised. In order to mitigate this issue, there is
    a concept called proof of work (POW). It actually slows down the creation of blocks
    ([Figure 6.2](chapter6.xhtml#fig6.2)).

    for all subsequent blocks. Now proof of work (POW) is a mathematical design where
    a pseudo-random number is presumed and joined with block data to calculate the
    hash, producing a result that equals a given criteria, for example a hash with
    a prefix of three zeroes. Once the result with the given condition is found, the
    result is verified by other nodes and the miners are rewarded with digital currency
    [[3](#re_TNF-CH006_CIT00003)]. As mining is a guessing game, miners are special
    nodes with special hardware or computational power who take part in this guessing
    game known as proof of work and are rewarded with digital currency on successfully
    guessing and adding a block in the blockchain. The miners with more computational
    power may succeed more often, but due to the law of statistical probability, it
    is highly unlikely that the same miner will do so every time. Using a consensus
    algorithm, you can actually agree one particular state of blockchain in the entire
    network. So if a new block is added in a blockchain, who will add it can be defined
    with the help of a consensus algorithm like proof of work (POW).

    and interestingly exploited. In one way we can say that we all are products which
    ironically social media monetize. We certainly have no option but trust social
    media to handle our data. There have been incidents where information data were
    compromised. There are a number of criticisms of public disclosure by social networking
    sites. Importantly, the information in the social media has no validation or authenticity,
    it totally depends upon the face value. However with the principles of blockchain,
    a mechanism exists by which we can deal with social media from a different angle
    altogether. Here we can participate directly without the intervention of third-party
    trust and we profit from the success of what we are posting. Now there are certain
    factors like decentralized social media; next is to reinvent the incentive structure
    of social media and also the validation and authenticity of posts. Social media
    is undergoing a metamorphic shift at this moment. Social media will experience
    consequences from the disruption of blockchain technology [[4](#re_TNF-CH006_CIT00004)].

- en: There are certain factors which influence shifting of social media with underlying
    blockchain technology. Verification of online identities is in increased demand.
    Fake IDs and vulnerability to fraud can be mitigated where the identities of customers
    can be verified using blockchain technology and smart contracts. Similar to the
    case of identities, marketplaces can also be verified using blockchain technology,
    where vendors are verified which will make marketing simpler and improve the return
    of investment and will also gain potential company growth. Cryptocurrencies can
    be a good combination with the advent of blockchain in social media. Posts, likes
    or any type of participation can yield small amounts of cryptocurrencies. There
    is also a demand for the collectibles of cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology
    where small investments are done in the form of cryptocurrencies, for example
    companies develop crypto-collectible games for Android and IOS in which cryptocurrencies
    are used. Blockchain with social media can stop the use of fake content which
    is now flooding social media. The technology will help to post traceable data
    and verified contents. This will help marketing teams and brand managers. Journalistic
    social media faces challenges on the media content that audiences rely on such
    as source reliability, excessive liberty in privacy, fake news and failure to
    regulate the structure and flow of information [[5](#re_TNF-CH006_CIT00005)].
    Although social media has given us lots of useful information, many of this is
    untraceable, has integrity issues and is unreliable and unethical.

    and can later follow each other on Twitter or other social networking links rather
    than vice versa. This will help in sales and marketing. Social media is actually
    not social and is basically a push mechanism. Data leaks, unreliable content and
    news, public disclosure and advertisers appealing for attention are some of the
    reasons why people started realizing the value of data and the risk of posting
    in public platforms. This platform is on the rise and also ready to change the

    individuals too because the users select the brands and they get paid for it.
    An individual’s digital identity is worth everything. Imagine a celebrity’s digital
    identity on a social networking site is valuable and a money earner. The answer
    remains to us for our likes and views which earn them money. That is one of the
    major reasons why the decentralization movement is powerful and we all will be
    a part of it. The tokenized business model will help to generate token rewards
    for photo uploads, views and likes. This will start a community business.. That
    is where the future is going, and this is what the technology enables. Although

    not possible unless views are exceeded. The present scenario of social media is
    centralized where users’ privacy and data security are at stake. Blockchain-based

    for most, but for those who have concerns, they might not be subscribers to social
    networking sites at all. Social networking sites have their own terms and conditions,
    promotion ideas and collaboration. Crowdfunding companies like Indiegogo and Kickstarter

    funds securely and without corruption. Without the external payment mechanism,
    the network that is running on cryptocurrency can support crowd sales. Blockchain-enabled
    social media will have an intense impact on widespread platforms like Twitter,
    Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Marketers in social media should explore and
    adopt these new blockchain-based social networking lobby to be an early bird in
    this opportunity. In the absence of any centralized authority, users on these
    networks benefit from greater privacy [[15](#re_TNF-CH006_CIT00015)]. In turn,
    this upholds the freedom of speech and expression, relieving users of the torments
    of being prosecuted for their thoughts on social media. Most decentralized social
    media platforms offer rewards for posting, liking and sharing content which provides
    a platform to earn. The sooner the social media marketer recognizes the potential
    of blockchain-based social media, the better they can create strategies for better
    business and earning and be a part of the new reality. So far so good, here we
    have explored some social media networks with underlying blockchain technology
    that are quite popular and disrupting the traditional systems. The significance
    of blockchain technology is primarily in addressing the major lack of security
    and data privacy. Amalgamating blockchain technology with social media is promising
    and the opportunities are huge. It is a decentralized movement where every piece
    of your data is precisely yours and you earn from your data. A rewarding experience
    awaits.
