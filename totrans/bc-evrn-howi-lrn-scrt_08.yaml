    Journal. Fueled by optimism that blockchain technology would wash over Wall Street,
    I envisioned Bitcoin Market Journal going head-to-head with the Wall Street Journal.
    Maybe we would even buy them out!

    springing up all over the world. Everyone wanted a “media partnership,” code for
    “You cover our trade show, and we’ll give you a free badge.” Costs them nothing;
    costs us thousands of dollars in travel and hotels.

    sunlit canals and charming old-world alleyways. My destination was this building
    at the University of Amsterdam, where I dropped my bike and gazed in awe.

    nutmeg, and cloves. Traders imported these spices from distant lands, at great
    cost and great peril, with the constant threat of pirates, disease, and shipwreck.^([15](notes.html#ch00-fn15))

    a storm sink the ship. To hedge their bets, investors banded together, putting
    money into a shared pot and enjoying the shared profits. They were called “shares,”
    because you shared in the fortunes of the company.

    East India Company. Now anyone—not just the wealthy—could invest in the global
    spice trade.

    of paper?” you can picture some seventeenth-century couple arguing. “And that
    has value why?” You can be sure many of the same interrogations we hear today
    about blockchain investing were played out in this very building.

    to buy an entire company; we want to buy a piece. By purchasing small pieces of
    different companies, we diversify our risk. This unlocks a flood of new money,
    because the market is now open to all.

    Using blockchain technology, we’re all able to own just a piece—and that is unleashing

    You can sell one million “shares” of that Van Gogh as a blockchain-based token.

    over time so they can sell them at a profit. Think about what this means for you,

    you have to increase the value of Van Gogh’s work.'

    Monopoly, which generate rent so you can upgrade to hotels.'

    value, that value can be tokenized.
