    Journal. Fueled by optimism that blockchain technology would wash over Wall Street,
    I envisioned Bitcoin Market Journal going head-to-head with the Wall Street Journal.
    Maybe we would even buy them out!

    “You cover our trade show, and we’ll give you a free badge.” Costs them nothing;
    costs us thousands of dollars in travel and hotels.

    nutmeg, and cloves. Traders imported these spices from distant lands, at great
    cost and great peril, with the constant threat of pirates, disease, and shipwreck.^([15](notes.html#ch00-fn15))

    a storm sink the ship. To hedge their bets, investors banded together, putting
    money into a shared pot and enjoying the shared profits. They were called “shares,”
    because you shared in the fortunes of the company.

    of paper?” you can picture some seventeenth-century couple arguing. “And that

    about blockchain investing were played out in this very building.

    to buy an entire company; we want to buy a piece. By purchasing small pieces of
    different companies, we diversify our risk. This unlocks a flood of new money,
    because the market is now open to all.
