- en: Blockchain is a new but quickly growing technology in the world, which was developed
    by a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Blockchain
    was un-hackable but now, due to use of quantum computers, it is possible to tamper
    with blockchain. As a counter to this, the researchers have come up with quantum
    blockchain using the principles of quantum cryptography. Today we see that the
    technology has given birth to many new technologies as well. One of its examples
    is non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are a new sort of blockchain-based token
    that is unique and indivisible. They were first created in 2014\. These are blockchain-based
    virtual assets. Since early 2021, the phenomena and its marketplaces have increased
    dramatically.

    as Satoshi Nakamoto is one of the most popular technology in the world today.
    It was first introduced as a medium of currency named as Bitcoin which has revolutionized
    the method of money holdings and transfer. Being referred as un-hackable this
    technology is reason for many changes in the currently existing system. It is
    basically a chunk of data that has been linked together ([Antonucci et. al., 2019](#r2)).
    Being a peer-to-peer technology the blockchain becomes more secure as all the
    transactions are updated in the public ledger and its copy is maintained by each
    user active on the network it is impossible to tamper data ([Frauenthaler et.
    al., 2020](#r5)).

    a false promise as with the rise of quantum computing it is now possible to manipulate
    the blockchain network as the quantum computer are million times more powerful
    than the currently existing classical computer. But as the answer of the question
    lies within the question only the researcher has come up with a solution we call
    Quantum-Resistant Blockchain.

    one of the most significant and rapidly evolving technology is Non-Fungible Token
    ([Salman, Jain & Gupta, 2019](#r20)). The term “near-field technology” (NFT) denotes
    a considerable development above earlier technologies. Proponents of blockchain
    technology and technologists have been criticized for their unduly optimistic
    and technologically deterministic outlooks. The current craze for NFTs has gripped
    the globe and is causing controversy. One thing is clear, however: These tokens
    are going to have a crucial role in constructing virtual lands termed as “METAVERSE”.
    The NFTs in broad terms open gates for fresh opportunities in the field of internet,
    gaming, real estate and also for the venture capitalists ([Khalid & Askar, 2021](#r10)).
    NFTs have a huge potential to make a lot of money for art creators and institutions
    simply by putting on sale an art with a digital signature. To construct a worldwide
    commercial environment an individual and the companies are dependent on each other
    to develop, transmit and preserve the crucial data, while NFTs offer an independent
    space for this.'

    the owner. The price of these ERC-20 tokens is decided by their current market
    price and the number of tokens created. These tokens are now interchangeable;
    hence they will always have the same value and can be exchanged for one another
    and are even ready to be traded in the marketplace. At the time of decision-making
