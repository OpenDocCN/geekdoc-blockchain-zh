    brings significant changes in many aspects of our life including smart homes,
    smart cities, healthcare, farming, etc. Despite the unlimited advantages of IoTs,
    the tremendous increase of interconnected smart devices attracts more threats
    and hence introduces many challenges related to the security and digital forensics
    of the IoT environment. Although the IoT forensics is relatively new domain of
    research, several IoT forensics frameworks have been proposed recently to investigate
    cybercrimes. However, blockchain-based IoT forensics is the most promising approach.
    This chapter introduces the digital forensics from the point of view of IoT environment.
    It also discusses recent IoT forensics challenges and presents the most recently
    developed blockchain-based frameworks for the IoT forensic.

    such as Internet of Things (IoT), fifth generation of telecommunications (5G),
    social networks, distributed blockchain technology, etc. Emerging technologies
    make our daily life faster, easier, and more enjoyable by developing fascinating
    devices, apps, and resources and such technologies bring the most valuable services
    at our fingertips. The exponential growth of the IoT devices, like smartphones,
    smart watches, CCTV cameras, washing machines, and medical implants pave the transformation

    they are becoming a rich source of information for cybercriminals. The underlying
    IoT infrastructures also become an ideal target for intruders and cyber-attackers
    due to its unique characteristics [[16](#CR16)]. Hence, we need to conduct digital
    forensics investigation process in order to prosecute the malicious activity in
    IoT environment known as IoT forensics.

- en: The existing digital forensic tools and procedures do not fit with the IoT environment
    due to many factors including high connectivity, heterogeneity, wide distribution
    and openness of IoT systems. The huge number of heterogeneous interconnected IoT
    devices generates huge amount of data which creates a major challenge for the
    IoT forensics professionals to identify, acquire, examine, analyze, and present
    the evidences. The diverse data format used by the IoT devices would also pose
    concerns in data analysis. Current digital forensic methodologies are centralized
    in nature which create much doubt about investigation transparency and reliability.
    Moreover, malicious actors can tamper the evidence because most of the data are
    stored in the IoT devices (e.g., wearable, phones) which in turn raise the question
    about evidence integrity and trustworthiness [[12](#CR12)]. In addition, every
    day exponential increased number of IoT devices becomes part of the IoT systems
    which demands scalable distributed infrastructure for conducting forensics process.

    forensic is still in its early stage and there is a lack in the literature regarding
    the approaches that can be used during investigation [[5](#CR5)]. One of the most
    promising technique is utilizing the blockchain. Considering its unique features,
    blockchain attracts many applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, supply-chain
    business, insurance, etc. with regard to the IoT, blockchain technology offers
    a unique set of functionalities which highly suitable for IoT forensic. That is,
    blockchain is a distributed, decentralized digital ledger that maintains the growing
    list of blocks in the peer-to-peer network. These features open the door to apply
    blockchain technology in IoT forensics investigation process as it can ensure
    evidence integrity, availability, traceability, accountability and system scalability.

    refers to the exchanged data among various devices in the IoT environment. Distributed
    ledger stores time-stamped blocks connected in a chain, providing an immutable,
    publicly accessible and verifiable by a consensus algorithm to ensure evidence
    trustworthiness. Since ledger is publicly available and distributed among participated
    stakeholders of an IoT environment, it eliminates the control of central authority
    on the data. This makes also impossible to insert, delete, modify the transaction
    data and ensures evidence integrity and availability.

    It is described as a legally acceptable procedure to collect, inspect, analyze,
    record the evidence and finally produce the digital evidence to the court for
    persecution [[10](#CR10)]. Digital forensics involves the study of data collected
    from digital devices such as wearable, medical devices, smart home appliances,
    smart vehicles, aerial drones, security systems, and sensor network. In 2006,
    US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) extended the scope for using electronically
    stored information (ESI) as evidence in civil cases [[9](#CR9)]. FRCP defines
    the discoverable artefacts such as electronically stored information including
    writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and
    other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can
    be obtained either directly or, into a reasonably usable form for forensics investigation.

    including homes, cities, health, industries, etc. Even though IoT will make our
    life more comfort and easy, security and privacy are still the most critical challenging
    issues in the IoT environment. Considering its unique features, including interconnectivity
    of massive number of heterogeneous devices, dynamic changes, and the complicated
    architecture, IoT environment is exposed to the possibility of being attacked
    easily by different types of attacks including hardware, operating systems, applications,
    data, and communication protocols [[25](#CR25)]. Unfortunately, to the best of
    our knowledge, there is no standard forensics procedure that can handle all of
    attacks. Instead, each attack is handled separately. Therefore, there is a tremendous
    need for a common forensics process which can help to ensure best practices of
    cyber-security that consider all the security issues related to the IoT environment.
    The effectiveness of IoT forensics process is highly depends on identifying the
    source of the forensic evidence.

    operating systems, and different applications supported by the devices, digital
    forensics professionals face difficulties to locate the source of the evidence.
    Unlike the traditional digital forensics where the sources of the of the evidence
    are usually restricted to a limited type of devices such PCs, servers, or even
    mobile devices, the forensic data sources in the IoT context are heterogeneous

    and storage), these devices can be considered an easy target for the attackers
    to obtain, alter, or even delete the sensitive information stored in these devices.
    Although these device can provide a vital amount of data, however, due to the

    in the case of any attack, it might be helpful to check the network logs to identify
    the source of evidence. However, considering the variety networking infrastructure

    chemical, medical, and phone-based sensors [[19](#CR19)]. They are also manufactured
    in different shapes and sizes. Considering their small sizes, some sensors could
    be hard to locate them by the IoT forensics professionals. Moreover, due to their

    the vital role of the controllers in the IoT environment, they might be one of
    the most targeted devices by the attackers and hence provide a significant evidence
    to the IoT forensics. However, due to their computing resource constraints, they
    may send data to a more powerful computer for analysis. This more powerful computer

    to collect the evidences from these devices. Considering the privacy, owners/users
    of smart devices should be informed to get their permissions to access the data

    and managing explosive amount of cyberattacks incidents is the key to success.
    Blockchain technology could be a suitable enabling technology which meets the
    demand and requirement of IoT forensics such evidence integrity, distribution
    and secure verification. Digital evidence can be easily added and collected from
    the blockchain network and the immutability feature of the blockchain will protect
    its legitimacy and consistency. Investigation authority can reliably access the
    forensically relevant and important evidence from any node of the chain.

- en: Ryu et al. [[23](#CR23)] proposed blockchain-based decentralized framework to
    conduct the IoT forensics investigation. The framework is divided into three main
    layers such as participants layer (top layer), blockchain (middle layer) and devices
    (bottom layer). During the interaction between IoT devices, they usually generate
    data and each interaction is called a transaction. In their proposed architecture,
    a transaction has five fields such as source device identity (SID), destination
    device identity (DID), exchange data (D), digital signature (S) and transaction
    id. Digital signature of a transaction was generated using the private key and
    source deceive identity (SID). Then, transaction id is produced by hashing twice
    of SID, DID, D and S using the SHA-256 hash function. Transactions are added one
    after another continuously into a block until the block size is exceeded. Once
    the block is completed, it is linked into the blockchain layer (middle layer).
    Participants from the top layer such as device users, manufacturers, service providers,
    and forensic investigators can verify the integrity of the blockchain. The proposed
    framework was simulated using Ethereum platform and smart contract interface is
    constructed using the Mist [[7](#CR7)] browser to carry out the evidence generation,
    collection and report presentation.

    by Hossain et al. [[11](#CR11)] in order to discover facts in cyberattack incidents
    within various IoT environments. FIF-IoT model aggregates all the communication
    happening among the various entities in the IoT environment such as IoT devices
    to IoT devices, IoT device to cloud, and users to IoT devices in the form of transaction.
    The transactions are sent to blockchain network where the miners from different
    stockholders obtain transactions and mine the new block by combining the relevance
    transactions. Finally, the blocks are glued into the public, distributed, and
    decentralized blockchain network. FIF-IoT framework is capable of catering integrity,
    confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the publicly-stored evidence.
    In addition, FIF-IoT framework proposed a scheme how to authenticate and verify
    the collected evidence during the investigation process.

    social system environment was proposed by Li et al. [[15](#CR15)], which can provide
    evidences traceability, provenance of data, reliability between IoT entities and
    forensic investigators. Building blocks of this architecture are users, IoT devices,
    Merkle tree, block, and smart contract. This framework collects the evidences
    only from the devices that are relevant and involved in a particular case. IoTFC
    method first gathers all the evident items and creates a distributed ledger in
    order to store and record the transactional evidents (TEs). Then these evidents
    (TEs) are shared and distributed to the legitimates participants through the blockchain
    network. To support the tamper proof environment, IoTFC builds a public timestamped
    log mechanism ensuring the full provenance of each evidence for all investigators
    without the existence of a trusted third party. This framework also graded the
    evidence into five types according to difficulty level such as g1 (easy to identify
    e.g., plain text, unencrypted image, QR), g2 (deliberate attempt to hide e.g.,
    renamed extension), g3 (hard to identify), g4 (difficult to identify e.g., encrypted
    data, password) and g5 (very difficult to identify e.g., steganography).

    [[14](#CR14)] to store all the events during digital forensic process. This model
    offers a cryptographic-based technique to eliminate the identity privacy problem.
    BIFF framework has three entities such as digital witness (DW), digital custodian
    (DC), and law enforcement agency (LEA). Each entity has different roles and rights
    in the IoT forensic process. LEA is the most important entity in the proposed
    framework who is the most trusted entity and responsible for evidence gathering,
    examining, evaluating, and archiving from DW and DC. Framework also defines each
    entity access right which includes read, write and verify right. All participant
    entities have read access but write and verify access rights are given to selective
    entities. BIFF framework has four main components such as transactions, smart
    contract, block, and consensus protocol. In order to ensure the privacy of an
    entity, BIFF framework combined the digital certificate techniques into the merkle
    signature.

- en: Mercan et al. [[17](#CR17)] proposed a cost-efficient IoT forensics framework
    leveraging multiple blockchain in two layers. This framework uses the multiple
    low-cost blockchain platforms which provide the multi-factor integrity (MFI).
    MFI feature of the model allows to withstand against any kind of malicious attack
    because attackers still need to break at least one more obstacle in order to breach
    the integrity of evidence. The proposed approach tries to reduce the data size
    to be written in public blockchain network by deploying hash function and merkle
    tree. In the very first stage, hash values of relevant IoT data are sorted into
    the 1st level EOS [[8](#CR8)] and Stellar [[24](#CR24)] blockchain network. In
    the second step, data center collects all confirmed transactions those are stored
    in 1st level blockchain network and builds a merkle tree. Finally, merkle root
    is computed and hash of all hashes are submitted to the 2nd level Ethereum blockchain.
    By delineating multi-level blockchain, framework significantly reduces the cost.

    solution is a promising emerging field and it is growing attention among the forensic
    scientists because it offers evident integrity, provenance, traceability and decentralized
    management. Yet effective mechanism need to be defined in order to ensure the
    data privacy and avoid race attack.

- en: Rapidly growing IoT environment is creating plethora of challenges for conducting
    IoT forensics. Therefore, there is an essential need to develop innovative IoT
    digital forensic techniques that can handle the challenges encountered by IoT
    forensic professional. Since IoT-based attacks escalate, it may become more impossible
    to convict perpetrators effectively with the existing traditional digital forensics
    mechanisms. Current proposed blockchain based frameworks lay the foundation for
    future practical forensic investigation work. Law enforcement agencies, IoT service
    providers, and device manufactures should join hands to withstands against challenges
    of IoT security and work together to provide a standard mechanism to deal with
    the cybercrimes in legitimate and standard manner securing the forensics evidence
    life-cycle.
