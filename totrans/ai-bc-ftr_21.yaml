    brings significant changes in many aspects of our life including smart homes,
    smart cities, healthcare, farming, etc. Despite the unlimited advantages of IoTs,
    the tremendous increase of interconnected smart devices attracts more threats
    and hence introduces many challenges related to the security and digital forensics
    of the IoT environment. Although the IoT forensics is relatively new domain of
    research, several IoT forensics frameworks have been proposed recently to investigate
    cybercrimes. However, blockchain-based IoT forensics is the most promising approach.
    This chapter introduces the digital forensics from the point of view of IoT environment.
    It also discusses recent IoT forensics challenges and presents the most recently
    developed blockchain-based frameworks for the IoT forensic.

    devices, apps, and resources and such technologies bring the most valuable services

    due to many factors including high connectivity, heterogeneity, wide distribution
    and openness of IoT systems. The huge number of heterogeneous interconnected IoT
    devices generates huge amount of data which creates a major challenge for the
    IoT forensics professionals to identify, acquire, examine, analyze, and present
    the evidences. The diverse data format used by the IoT devices would also pose
    concerns in data analysis. Current digital forensic methodologies are centralized
    in nature which create much doubt about investigation transparency and reliability.
    Moreover, malicious actors can tamper the evidence because most of the data are
    stored in the IoT devices (e.g., wearable, phones) which in turn raise the question
    about evidence integrity and trustworthiness [[12](#CR12)]. In addition, every
    day exponential increased number of IoT devices becomes part of the IoT systems
    which demands scalable distributed infrastructure for conducting forensics process.

    blockchain attracts many applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, supply-chain
    business, insurance, etc. with regard to the IoT, blockchain technology offers
    a unique set of functionalities which highly suitable for IoT forensic. That is,
    blockchain is a distributed, decentralized digital ledger that maintains the growing
    list of blocks in the peer-to-peer network. These features open the door to apply
    blockchain technology in IoT forensics investigation process as it can ensure

    trustworthiness. Since ledger is publicly available and distributed among participated

    It is described as a legally acceptable procedure to collect, inspect, analyze,
    record the evidence and finally produce the digital evidence to the court for
    persecution [[10](#CR10)]. Digital forensics involves the study of data collected
    from digital devices such as wearable, medical devices, smart home appliances,
    smart vehicles, aerial drones, security systems, and sensor network. In 2006,
    US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) extended the scope for using electronically
    stored information (ESI) as evidence in civil cases [[9](#CR9)]. FRCP defines
    the discoverable artefacts such as electronically stored information including
    writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and
    other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can
    be obtained either directly or, into a reasonably usable form for forensics investigation.

    conduct the IoT forensics investigation. The framework is divided into three main
    layers such as participants layer (top layer), blockchain (middle layer) and devices
    (bottom layer). During the interaction between IoT devices, they usually generate
    data and each interaction is called a transaction. In their proposed architecture,
    a transaction has five fields such as source device identity (SID), destination
    device identity (DID), exchange data (D), digital signature (S) and transaction
    id. Digital signature of a transaction was generated using the private key and
    source deceive identity (SID). Then, transaction id is produced by hashing twice
    of SID, DID, D and S using the SHA-256 hash function. Transactions are added one
    after another continuously into a block until the block size is exceeded. Once
    the block is completed, it is linked into the blockchain layer (middle layer).
    Participants from the top layer such as device users, manufacturers, service providers,
    and forensic investigators can verify the integrity of the blockchain. The proposed
    framework was simulated using Ethereum platform and smart contract interface is
    constructed using the Mist [[7](#CR7)] browser to carry out the evidence generation,
    collection and report presentation.

    forensic investigators. Building blocks of this architecture are users, IoT devices,
    Merkle tree, block, and smart contract. This framework collects the evidences
    only from the devices that are relevant and involved in a particular case. IoTFC
    method first gathers all the evident items and creates a distributed ledger in

    (TEs) are shared and distributed to the legitimates participants through the blockchain
    network. To support the tamper proof environment, IoTFC builds a public timestamped
    log mechanism ensuring the full provenance of each evidence for all investigators
    without the existence of a trusted third party. This framework also graded the
    evidence into five types according to difficulty level such as g1 (easy to identify
    e.g., plain text, unencrypted image, QR), g2 (deliberate attempt to hide e.g.,
    renamed extension), g3 (hard to identify), g4 (difficult to identify e.g., encrypted

    leveraging multiple blockchain in two layers. This framework uses the multiple
    low-cost blockchain platforms which provide the multi-factor integrity (MFI).
    MFI feature of the model allows to withstand against any kind of malicious attack
    because attackers still need to break at least one more obstacle in order to breach
    the integrity of evidence. The proposed approach tries to reduce the data size
    to be written in public blockchain network by deploying hash function and merkle
    tree. In the very first stage, hash values of relevant IoT data are sorted into
    the 1st level EOS [[8](#CR8)] and Stellar [[24](#CR24)] blockchain network. In
    the second step, data center collects all confirmed transactions those are stored
    in 1st level blockchain network and builds a merkle tree. Finally, merkle root
    is computed and hash of all hashes are submitted to the 2nd level Ethereum blockchain.
