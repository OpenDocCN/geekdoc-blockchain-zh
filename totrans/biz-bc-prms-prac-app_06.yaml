    from the research department, but they could be part of an innovation group, as
    long as they have had operational experience. The Blockchain Czar will be responsible
    for removing obstacles within your organization, facilitating education, curating
    and sharing best practices, and overseeing the progress of various implementations
    across the organization. This job is a tough one, because it involves finding

    need to be demonstrated. These labs typically have an internal focus to “show

    departments within the organization. Their challenge is typically not in the incubation
    of ideas, but rather in how these ideas get handed over and implemented inside
    other departments and business units who are the real implementations playgrounds.

    a given direction. The role of this group could be more about sharing and collective

    together as nodes, and into an ever expanding topology. It is a basic foundational
    element of a blockchain. Each node runs the same software, therefore delivering
    inherent redundancies to the whole network, which means that if one node goes
    down, or is not responding, the work of other nodes is always compensating. In
    essence, a P2P network is difficult to take down entirely. You would have to take
    each and every node down.

    It can be thought of as a large decentralized computer (actually made-up of the
    several P2P machines) that contains information about the millions of accounts,
    which update an internal database, execute code, and interact with one another.
    Programs written in Smart Contract Language get compiled into the Virtual Machine,

    is continuously maintained and updated. A fallacy is that the blockchain is a
    distributed ledger. In the technical sense, it is not, but it acts as one, because
    the collection of transactions on blocks is equivalent to a distributed ledger.
    However, you can build immutable distributed ledger applications based on the
    historical records that the blockchain provides.

- en: Bitcoin was not designed around accounts, although accounts are a more common
    way to think about the transactions that are taking place, because we are used
    to looking at our banking transactions as such. Under the hood, Bitcoin uses a
    method called Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO), a concept that links unspent
    transactions as an output that can be spent as an input in a new transaction.
    Other blockchains use different methods to keep tracks of state balance. Ripple
    has a ledger that contains a snapshot of the current balances held everywhere
    on the network as opposed to a chain of historical events. In Ethereum, the state
    is made up of objects called “accounts,” with each account having state transitions
    being direct transfers of value and information between accounts.

    However, the blockchain also has the potential to replace some back-end processes,
    so you must take that likely scenario into account. But keep in mind that it will
    be easier to start implementing blockchain solutions in some new segments, without
    internal integrations. If your starting position includes your current systems,
    then you are inherently extending your implementation horizon by potentially as
    long as an extra 18–24 months. So, why not consider starting with no baggage and
    earn new customers who want to try something new?

    do not like to disrupt themselves unless they are forced to. Within large companies,
    the first likely scenarios will be to deploy blockchain technology to strengthen
    their existing operations, by achieving new levels of efficiency or seeing cost
    reductions. However, it may not be enough. The specter of outside disruption will
    still loom if you stop short at the constructive/defensive stages.

    your toes into new technology without getting totally wet. But the risks are that
    they could be timid experiments that do not show commitments and they might reach
    a dead-end, because they will not always allow you to see the potential benefits.
    It’s better to implement smaller blockchain projects end-to-end where you can
    see results and a full lifecycle of usage with real users. That said, POCs can
    be used to narrow down a portfolio of committed projects, but you need to move

    that you want to be ambitious enough to tackle the required toughness in changing
    business processes. If you think that the blockchain technology is not ready yet,
    or has some weaknesses that might be solved later, then use that time to start
    reengineering your business process, and by the time you are done the technology
    will be ready.

    and if you do not like them, you throw them out. Use cases could lead to something,
    or maybe not. The term “use case” assumes that something has to fit within existing
    processes, so the bar is not high enough for making more difficult choices that
    go beyond the obvious, and into the innovation discovery potential. The next section

    is a limiting question on its own. For example, if you look at the startup innovation
    around banks in FinTech, you will see plenty of cases where these new companies
    did not really solve a “problem” the banks had, but they tackled a particular
    market or service differently. So the tipping point was to compete by reframing
    the opportunity, for example, peer-to-peer lending, unconventional home loans,
    really fast approval cycles, efficient robot investing, and so on.
