    of collective institutions that we can trust. Trust is the currency of civilization.^([1](preface01.html#ch01fn1))

- en: The human brain is hardwired for stories. Our earliest lessons come from children’s
    stories—fairy tales and fables—always with a great lesson, a moral to the story.
    From the story of Cinderella, we learn *Beauty is skin deep*. From the myth of
    Icarus, we learn *Don’t fly too close to the sun*. From practically every movie
    ever made, we learn *Good will triumph over evil*.

    Stories are how we get important concepts to latch on to the brain. Stories are

    of learning was the *case study*, which is a type of business story. In a case
    study, you’re dropped into a real-world scenario—maybe you’re the *New York Times*
    trying to go digital, or the CEO of Disney deciding whether to acquire Pixar.
    The case study ends at a point in time—like the end of a chapter—and you have
    to figure out what to do next. *You have to continue the story*.

- en: Case studies are fun to read because they’re real-world stories. They’re interesting
    to analyze because, like business itself, there’s no right or wrong answer. They’re
    easier to remember because, instead of memorizing facts, you have a real-world
    example that will stick on to your brain like Velcro.

    (enough to be dangerous), but more important, you’ll learn practical applications
