    messages in order to ensure their validity. Implementing a “Byzantine Fault Tolerance”

    especially if the blockchain is a public one, for example, Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum
    (ETH). Cryptocurrency is generally an economic proxy to the viable operations
    and security of a blockchain. Sometimes it is represented by a token, which is
    another form of related representation of an underlying cryptocurrency.

    which is enough to keep most consumers away. In a 2014 paper describing a method
    for stabilizing cryptocurrency, Robert Sams quoted Nick Szabo: “The main volatility
    in bitcoin comes from variability in speculation, which in turn is due to the
    genuine uncertainty about its future. More efficient liquidity mechanisms do not
    help reduce genuine uncertainty*.*” As cryptocurrency gains more acceptance and
    understanding, its future will be less uncertain, resulting in a more stable and
    gradual adoption curve.'

    rewards when they successfully validate transactions. Cryptocurrency can also
    have a “consumption” role when paying a small fee for running a smart contract
    (e.g., Ethereum’s ETH), or as a transaction fee equivalent (e.g., Ripple’s XRP
    or Bitcoin’s BTC). These economic incentives and costs are put in place to prevent
    abuse of the blockchain. In a more advanced usage case, the token can be used
    as a unit of internal value, for example in Distributed Autonomous Organizations
    (DOAs), a subject that will be covered later in Chapters 5 and 7 of this book.

    to digital money or assets that have been digitized. Every time a consensus is
    reached, a transaction is recorded on a “block” which is a storage space. The
    blockchain keeps track of these transactions that can be later verified as having
    taken place. The blockchain is therefore this giant transaction processing platform,
    capable of handling microtransactions and large value transactions alike.

    comes to mind is their processing throughput, which is measured in transactions
    per second (TPS). As a reference, in 2015, VISA handled an average of 2,000 TPS
    on their VisaNet, with a peak rate of 4,000 TPS, and a peak capacity of 56,000
    TPS. During 2015, PayPal processed a total 4.9 billion payments,[⁷](part0008.xhtml#c01-note-7-1)
    equivalent to 155 TPS. As of 2016, the Bitcoin blockchain was far from these numbers,
    hovering at 5–7 TPS, but with prospects of largely exceeding it due to advances
    in sidechain technology and expected increases in the Bitcoin block size. Some
    other blockchains are faster than Bitcoins. For example, Ethereum started with
    10 TPS in 2015, edging towards 50–100 TPS in 2017, and targeting 50,000–100,000
    TPS by 2019.[⁸](part0008.xhtml#c01-note-8-1) Private blockchains are even faster
    because they have less security requirements, and we are seeing 1,000–10,000 TPS
    in 2016, going up to 2,000–15,000 TPS in 2017, and potentially an unlimited ceiling
    beyond 2019\. Finally, linking blockchain’s output to clustered database technology
    might push these transactional throughput limits even higher, leading to a positive
    development.

    it is the job of software developers to figure out how they can re-write their

    paradigm. The blockchain is a “state machine,” which is another concept that needs
    to be understood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In technical terms, a state just means “stored information” at a specific point
    in time. A state machine is a computer or device that remembers the status of
    something at a given instant in time. Based on some inputs, that status might
    change, and it provides a resulting output for these implemented changes. Keeping
    track of transitions of these states is important and that’s what the blockchain
    does well, and in a way that is immutable. In contrast, a database’s record is
    mutable, because it can be re-written many times over. Not all databases have
    audit trails, and even if they do, an audit trail could be destroyed or lost,
    because it’s not tamper proof. In the blockchain, the transition history is a
    persistent part of the information about that state. In the Ethereum blockchain,
    a distinct “state tree” is stored, representing the current balance of each address,
    and a “transaction list” representing the transactions between the current block
    and previous blocks in each block.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decentralized consensus breaks the old paradigm of centralized consensus, that
    is, when one central database used to rule transaction validity. A decentralized
    scheme (which blockchain protocols are based on), transfers authority and trust
    to a decentralized virtual network, and enables its nodes to continuously and
    sequentially record transactions on a public “block,” creating a unique “chain,”
    the blockchain. Each successive block contains a “hash” (a unique fingerprint)
    of the previous code, therefore cryptography (via hash codes) is used to secure
    the authentication of the transaction source and removes the need for a central
    intermediary. The combination of cryptography and blockchain technology ensures
    there is never a duplicate recording of the same transaction. What’s important
    here is that with this degree of unbundling, the consensus logic is separate from
    the application itself, therefore applications can be written to be organically
    decentralized, and that is the spark for a variety of system-changing innovations
    in the software architecture of applications, whether they are money or non-money
    related.

    consensus protocols such as RAFT, DPOS, and Paxos, but we are not going into that
