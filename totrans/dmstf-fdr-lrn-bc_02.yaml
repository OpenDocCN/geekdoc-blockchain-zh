  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The internet of technology (IoT) refers to the connectivity of smart devices
    with the internet to accumulate data and transfer it to smart devices. But with
    the lack of built-in security measures, IoT is vulnerable to privacy and security
    threats. Blockchain technology assists in the security needs of IoT devices. The
    main characteristics of blockchain technology like immutability, transparency,
    auditability, and encryption of data sort out the inadequacy of IoT devices. This
    chapter represents an inclusive survey on blockchain and IoT technologies with
    the integration of these technologies to overcome the shortfall. This chapter
    includes an overview of both technologies with their advantages and disadvantages.
    It also highlights the domains of their applications and represents the advantages
    of integration of blockchain and IoT technology to develop BIoT (blockchain-based
    IoT). Also, it analyzes the main challenges faced during the smooth integration
    of blockchain and IoT technologies.

- en: Blockchain has a list of records which is called blocks. All the blocks are
    linked by using cryptographic techniques (Alphonse & Starvin, 2020). Blockchain
    can be defined as a transparent, trusted, and decentralized ledger on a peer-to-peer
    network and it is a virtual Bitcoin cryptocurrency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto
    in 2008\. The transaction is the data unit on the Blockchain and certain numbers
    of transactions are bundled in a Block (N. Kumar & Aggarwal, 2020). The cryptographic
    hash value is calculated and placed in its next block along with the timestamp.
    Blockchain is a distributed and open ledger that records transactions very efficiently.
    The alteration of data in the blockchain is restricted (Bach et al., 2018). For
    all the participant's blockchain ledger is available to access but still not regulated
    by any network authorities and this can be possible by imposing strict rules and
    mutual agreement between the network nodes (Uddin et al., 2021). Each block in
    the blockchain has contained the hash value that stores the hash value of the
    previous block. Hash is a unique address of each block assigned during its creation
    and any modification in the block will lead to a change in its hash value. The
    root hash value for all the transactions is stored. The timestamp is stored as
    the creation time of the block and the Nonce value is ensuring that the present
    hash value is below the target shown in Figure 1.

    are not possible to backdate or temper them because of this technology and double

    technology is used to transfer the items like money, property, contracts, and
    many more in a secure manner without the involvement of third parties like banks
    or the government. Data stored in blockchain are very hard to modify.

    answer is yes and it is possible only because of blockchain. Sometimes, transactions
    are failed in the traditional manner of banking because of many reasons like technical
    issues, account hacking, exceeding of daily transfer limit, transfer charges,
    and many more. Cryptocurrency is used to sort out these problems of the traditional
    mode of transactions. A cryptocurrency is a form of digital payment that can be
    used for products and services. Now many companies have issued their currencies
    which are called tokens and these tokens are used by the user to done the payment
    for the products and services for that companies. Cryptocurrency is the binary
    or virtual currencies that use a technology called a blockchain. Blockchain is
    a decentralized technology that spread across many nodes and these nodes are manage
    and record the transactions (Sharma et al., 2020).

    of many transactions and a hash value of its immediately earlier block that helps
    to link the blocks. Blocks are can be traced with the help of this hash value
    and for that reason, alteration or modification in the blocks are not possible.
    A block can be portioned into two parts like transaction records and a header.
    Transaction records are maintained in a Merkle tree as shown in Figure 7\. Merkle
    tree is a binary tree of data structure that sums up and helps to check the large
    data set efficiently and securely. Each node of the blockchain network is needed
    to maintain a complete copy of each transaction that takes place in the blockchain
    and help the user to check whether a transaction is included in a block or not.
    The header of the block may contain a hash value of the preceding block for authentication,
    a Merkle tree root, a Nonce that provides hash value, and a timestamp which refers
    to the created time of the block. The digital signature is used to authenticate
    the content on the digital platform. The digital signature is using the public
    key cryptography system which consists of the public and private keys for authentication
    of binary data.

    main point of IoT is the integration of the devices. These smart devices initially
    collect the data from the environment and after that share it on the network through
    the internet (Sharma et al., 2020). With the help of IoT technology, real-world
    objects are converted into an intelligent object of the virtual world (Bayani
    et al., 2018). This technology also helps in the control of the objects and updates
    the state of the objects and also provides the better accommodation of data. Internet
    of Things has a combination of two words: internet and things (Jalali et al.,

- en: The motivation of this section is to explain the collaboration of two above-mentioned
    technologies like IoT and Blockchain which are referred to as Blockchain-based
    IoT (BIoT). Millions of heterogeneous IoT devices are generating a huge amount
    of data and need a technology that provides security to that data. This security
    problem of data is solved by the integration of IoT and blockchain technologies.
    Decentralized characteristics of blockchain technology help to eliminate the shortcoming
    linked with centralized architecture-based systems. IoT technology help to reduce
    the size of the objects and blockchain technology help to provide security to
    the data collected by IoT devices. Digital cameras, sensors, or smartphones are
    some IoT-based devices that provide gigantic large networks by device-to-device
    interactions. IoT technology has to face the challenge of trust where every device
    has access to data and will authenticate that the data is tamper by any device
    or node. BIoT integration can increase the data sharing between the IoT devices
    by providing security to data. IoT devices are required to share reliable data
    in the system and will ultimately improve performance. Integration of these two
    technologies allows users to get the benefit of both technologies more efficiently
    and powerfully (Sharma et al., 2020) (Reyna et al., 2018) shown in Figure 15\.
    Blockchain technology improves the function of IoT technology by providing trustable
    services because blockchain data is reliable and also easy traceable. It increases
    security because data sources are recognized at any time and data remains immutable.
    In applications where the security of data is the main concern, the integration
    of technologies will provide a guaranty that the data will be shared between the
    trustworthy user (Tandon, 2019). So the integration of these two emerging technologies
    would represent a key revolution (Tandon, 2019). Some advantages of BIoT are listed
    in Figure 16\. Table 2 listed some related work on the integration of IoT with
    the Blockchain technology.
