    through light pink flesh. “Yeah, we feed these mussels chicken and pig poop, so
    you might want to wash your hands after this,” says my host, Zhao. Inside a large
    shell about twenty centimeters tall and ten centimeters wide is a mass of pearls
    stuck to the interior. One by one, through the film of slimy water on mussel meat,
    I remove each of these pearls and put them in a red plastic bucket.

    mangy dog whose sole purpose is to protect these ponds from pearl thieves is chained
    next to it. Narrow, unpaved muddy roads form a grid across these ponds. There
    are some other people on small metal boats, tending to mussels. Zhao is dressed

    managed to stay clean despite the mud.

    his long, carefully phrased speeches that burst with excitement, his proclamations
    about how he is disrupting the pearl industry, and his inability to let any part
    of the conversation fall silent. He’s talking, telling me about his vision, asking
    his director of marketing to show me an image, trying to convince me of their
    future plans. His hair is choppily cut, and he’s constantly gesturing, pointing,

    them under the age of thirty. If he’s the firecracker CEO who swaggers around

    advances have enabled more sophisticated software, such software would not exist
    without the particular working processes and collaboration methods that bind tech
    companies together. These processes that enable companies to run lean draw upon
    *gemba kaizen*, or the art of continuous improvement, pioneered by Japanese management
    consultants. *Gemba kaizen* emphasizes cutting away waste, and ensuring that workers
    and managers are aligned, decreasing miscommunications and wasted time, known
    as “thrash.” Originally used as a working process in Japanese manufacturing, agile
    methods in software are now spilling back over into other industries. Zhao’s company

    mistakes, making sure communication is clear, always syncing managers and workers

- en: “It takes five years to get a good pearl, and you have to seed these mussels,
    with flesh from another mussel. Each of the pearls starts off as a round piece
    of flesh from another mussel. Another thing is maintenance. The mussels are bottom-feeders,
    and we feed them chicken and pig feces. But if you put too much in, algal blooms
    start to form and choke up the mussels. Algae loves warm water, which does make
    pearls grow faster. One of the hardest parts is raising the next cycle of mussels,
    since when they reproduce, the larvae stick to fish gills. You have to really
    use a lot of water to force the larvae to come off the fish and to grow into a
    large-enough mussel.”

    area and a pioneer of the industry. While pearl farming has existed in China since
    the thirteenth century, it wasn’t until the 1980s that it became industrialized
    under China’s “reform and opening up,” initiated by Deng Xiaoping, when the state
    enacted policies for market privatization. The change in production scale demanded
    a shift in mussel species as well. Early industrial-scale farmers like Zhao’s
    father-in-law started switching to the *Hyriopsis cumingi* mussel, the “three-corner
    mussel” (*sanjiaobang*, 三角蚌), which has far higher pearl yields than traditional
    mussels. The local ecology has changed drastically since the 1980s, with waterways
    becoming inundated with excess nitrogen and phosphorus from the animal feces that
    feed the mussels.

    years, with Xi Jinping recently trying to revive an ancient plan to funnel water
    from the south to the dry north. While Zhao’s father-in-law originally used public
    ponds for his mussels, the government started to regulate the industrial uses
    of public waterways in the 1990s. Farmers scrambled to turn their tiny plots of
    land into lucrative pearl ponds instead. In 2017, the town of Shanxiahu and the
    surrounding villages produced a thousand tons of pearls, making the area the global
    epicenter of cultured pearls.

    marketing company that distributes these oysters. As a consultant, she purchases
    the wish pearl oysters from the MLM company up front, and there’s pressure for
    her to sell as many as she can, otherwise she’s stuck with oysters that she’s
    unable to off-load. All oysters have a pearl in them, and sometimes two, which
    is known in pearl party parlance as “getting twins.” After opening the oyster

    and cultivating entrepreneurship, is not new. It’s been around since the 1950s,
    with Avon makeup and Tupperware. But MLMs really began to gain traction in the
    1970s, under a branch of New Age thought called the human potential movement.
    MLMs thrived in this movement’s combination of spiritualism and self-improvement
    tied to personal wealth attainment. People like the minister and author Norman
    Vincent Peale sold the power of positive thinking and a “gospel” of prosperity,
    while entrepreneurs like William Penn Patrick pioneered the MLM tactic of charging
    sellers in his multilevel marketing company, Holiday Magic, for courses on “mind
    dynamics.” This blend of mysticism and capitalism paved the way for the 1980s,
    when multilevel marketing morphed into its current form, becoming predatory and
    insidiously corporate. This form is far more exploitative, wooing people with
    the illusion of flexible hours and “being your own boss,” only to push them deep
    into debt by getting them to purchase up front thousands of dollars’ worth of
    often unsellable, low-quality merchandise.

    Vincent Peale）这样的人推销着积极思考的力量和繁荣的“福音”，而像威廉·彭恩·帕特里克（William Penn Patrick）这样的企业家则开创了多层次营销公司Holiday
    Magic向销售员收费学习“心灵动力学”的策略。这种神秘主义和资本主义的融合为20世纪80年代铺平了道路，使多层次营销变成了目前的形式，变得掠夺性和阴险地商业化。这种形式更具剥削性，用可灵活安排的时间和“做自己的老板”的幻觉来诱惑人们，只是为了让他们预先购买成千上万美元的常常难以销售的低质量商品而导致他们负债累累。

    Before I leave Zhuji, Lisa explains the process for making a wish pearl. First,
    a large triangle mussel is inoculated with small plastic balls. A coat of lacquer
    is allowed to form over a year—much less than the standard five years for a quality
    pearl. Each triangle mussel produces thirty to forty pearls. Since the excitement
    of a pearl party is in the opening up of an oyster that has one or maybe two pearls,
    the pearl farm takes small, cheap oysters, opens them up, and transfers one of
    the original pearls from the large mussel into the smaller oyster. This small
    oyster is now a wish oyster. Lisa told me that if I wanted, I could custom order
    pearls to be dyed all sorts of colors before being inserted into the smaller oyster.
    This is because pearl party hostesses often like to announce what each pearl color
    symbolizes—luck, happiness, or friendship. Each oyster is worth less than RMB

- en: Shipping is a drag, explains Lisa. One method the companies in Zhuji have been
    trying is vacuum sealing the small oysters individually. Before vacuum sealing,
    the oysters are soaked in formaldehyde, a slightly carcinogenic chemical that
    stings and smells bad, preserving the dead flesh and preventing rot. Another chemical,
    which Lisa doesn’t remember the name of, is used to make sure that the small oysters
    remain closed—after all, an open oyster signals a dead oyster, and the whole point
    of a pearl party is to shuck ones that *look* alive. While vacuum sealing has
    been successful in cutting down on shipping costs, the weight of hundreds of oysters
    leads to occasional crushing. Another method is to ship the oysters in cans of
    formaldehyde. Kristie’s Krazy Kultured Pearl Parties uses oysters preserved by
    this method, I observe, as one evening Kristie remarks that her hands sting from

    —— 毕竟，一个敞开的牡蛎意味着一只死去的牡蛎，而珍珠聚会的整点在于打开*看起来*还活着的牡蛎。虽然真空密封已经成功地削减了运输成本，但成百上千只牡蛎的重量偶尔会导致挤压。另一种方法是把牡蛎装在甲醛罐里运输。克里斯蒂的“疯狂养殖珍珠聚会”使用这种方法保存了牡蛎，我观察到，因为有一个晚上克里斯蒂说她的手因为臭味大的牡蛎而发疼。我通过屏幕无法闻到任何味道，这可能就是为什么这种通过直播的珍珠聚会幻觉如此成功。

    premised on the illusory figure of “the Child.” The call to act is haunted by
    the specter of “our children,” whether it is a future of environmental destruction
    or a disorderly future without “traditional values.” We are always trying to live
    for the child that does not yet exist, fixing the world for our children who do,
    impressing our expectations on their desires. These political visions draw upon
    fears of decline or loss of control, on an innate need to crave a future—some
    kind of story or meaning that motivates us to keep living. This same need is the

  zh: 在李·埃德尔曼的《无未来：酷儿理论与死亡冲动》一书中，他激励读者思考一套不可能存在的政治，一种失败的理论。虽然传统政治被定义为左右之间的推拉，但他坚持认为，我们大多数人最终会创造一种以“孩子”为幻影的文化。行动的呼声被“我们的孩子”的阴影所困扰，不论是环境破坏的未来还是没有“传统价值观”的混乱未来。我们总是试图为尚未存在的孩子而活，为那些已经存在的孩子改变世界，《我们的期望赋予了他们的欲望》。这些政治愿景都源于对衰退或失控的恐惧，对渴求未来的内在需求
    —— 一种激励我们继续生活的故事或意义。这种需求也是我们陷入追逐未来循环的原因，一个从未出现得如我们所想象那么完美的未来。

    cry for “no future.” By definition, it’s a kind of release, perhaps a Buddhist
    nirvana.

  zh: 唯一的出路，埃德尔曼建议说，是宣布结束未来 —— 一个“无未来”的呐喊口号。从定义上来看，这是一种释放，也许是一种佛教的涅槃。
- en: 'The future has been sold to all of us, not just the *shehui ren* of Facebook
    Live or Chinese Kuai, as a lottery, a glint of happiness or a threat of catastrophe.
    And while I don’t see myself as a *shehui ren* who pushes against the broader
    system, the more livestream I watch, the more I wonder: What is the point of respectability,
    of living for imagined futures? Figures prance across my phone screen: young men
    in the countryside of China, elderly grandparents with no teeth watching their
    grandsons moonwalk and sell acne cream. Kristie singing another round of “Like
    a Pearl-Gin.” Desire and future becoming one, into a desperation I can feel.'

  zh: 未来已经被卖给了我们所有人，不仅是Facebook Live或中国快手的社会人，作为一场彩票，幸福的一丝或灾难的威胁。而当我不再把自己看作是一个反抗更广泛系统的社会人时，我看的直播越多，我就越在想：端正的意义是什么，为了想象中的未来而活着？数字在我手机屏幕上跳动：中国乡村的年轻人，没有牙齿的老奶奶们看着她们的孙子跳迈克尔杰克逊的月球漫步并卖洗脸霜。Kristie又唱了一轮“像一颗珍珠-金”。“欲望和未来变为一体，变得如此绝望，我能感受到。
- en: I think of my parents, my grandparents. My grandmother and her nightmares, how
    the last few years of her life were marked by her confronting the depth of her
    past, despite having lived for the future in her youth. My mother’s insistence
    on a better life, as she defined it, full of expectations for her children’s future
    that neither my sister nor I was able to fulfill. Her fingertips, cracked and
    dry from working, saving for a life that she felt was not hers. Why do I work
    long days to dutifully pay off the five-figure student debt I have, the debt I
    took on in fantasizing about a better life? Even if I paid off the debt, would
    the debt-free future that awaited me be as perfect as I imagine?

  zh: 我想起我的父母，我的祖父母。我的祖母和她的噩梦，她生命的最后几年被她对抗自己过去的深度所标记，尽管她年轻时为了未来而活着。我母亲坚持要过上更好的生活，她定义了这样一种生活，对她孩子们的未来期望很高，然而我和我姐姐都无法实现。她因工作而指尖干裂，为了一种她感觉不属于她的生活而节俭。为什么我要努力工作来勤奋地偿还我欠下的五位数学生债务，这是因为我幻想过更好的生活吗？即使我偿清了债务，那等待我的无债未来会如我所想的那么完美吗？
- en: I think I keep showing up every day for the same reason Kristie and Nicly do.
    A sense of purpose, a sense of being needed. A community, no matter how small.
    I dutifully take the BART ride from the East Bay to San Francisco every day, to
    a beautifully generic office filled with standing desks and Aeron chairs. I show
    up despite knowing that the only thing my time and labor amount to is making rich
    men richer. The best parts of work are the interactions with other people, and
    even conflict gives a sense of community. I spend more time with my coworkers
    than with friends or partners. My daily life is either sleeping or working. It’s
    like having a family, but I wonder if this is the family I would actively choose.
    And on evening BART rides back home, I listen to music in my headphones, watching
    other people with startup-logo-embroidered backpacks scroll vigorously on their
    phones, smirking and laughing at the screens. I am still left with a sense of
    loneliness. Kristie’s next pearl party awaits me at home, along with a box of
    Green Chef and some packages from online New Age boutiques.

  zh: 我认为我每天都会出现的理由和Kristie以及Nicly一样。一种目的感，一种被需要的感觉。无论多么微小的社区。我每天都会义不容辞地从东湾乘坐BART到旧金山，到一个装满站立桌和Aeron椅子的办公室。我会出现，尽管我知道，我的时间和劳动所得到的唯一回报是使富人更富有。工作最好的部分是和其他人的互动，即使冲突也给人一种社区感。我和同事们相处的时间比与朋友或伴侣在一起的时间还要多。我的日常生活要么是睡觉，要么是工作。就像有一个家庭，但我想知道这是否是我愿意积极选择的家庭。在回家的夜晚BART车上，我戴着耳机听着音乐，看着背上有创业公司标志的人们在手机上滚动，对屏幕上的信息傻笑。我仍然感到孤独。Kristie在家等着我的下一场珍珠聚会，还有一箱绿色厨师食品和一些来自在线新时代精品店的包裹。
- en: 'Maybe that’s just a microcosm of the difficult work that we want to skip: the
    work of building a community upheld by boundlessness and belonging, a sense of
    purpose beyond reducing work and life to simple economics. I think of the Peppa
    Pig meme and how strong a new community’s culture can grow, aided by symbols.
    It’s easy to mistake the power of the Peppa Pig meme as simply resulting from
    the internet. But culture and community, not technology, are the driving force
    behind its power, its threat to the elite. As internet researchers such as An
    Xiao Mina and sociologists have shown, the driving force behind broader sociopolitical
    change has always been culture, with or without the internet.^([7](notes-ch8.xhtml#notes-ch8-7))
    Cultural change comes before political change, and that cultural change starts
    with us. It is up to us to make meaning, to make new symbols.'

  zh: 也许这只是我们想要跳过的困难工作的微观模拟：建立一个由无限和归属感支撑的社区，一个超越简单经济学将工作和生活简化的目的。我想到了佩琪猪模因以及一个新社区文化可以如何强大，受到符号的帮助。人们很容易错误地认为佩琪猪模因的力量仅仅源于互联网。但文化和社区，而不是技术，是其力量的驱动力，其对精英的威胁。正如互联网研究者安·夏·密娜和社会学家所展示的，对更广泛的社会政治变革的推动力一直是文化，无论有没有互联网。文化变革首先发生于政治变革之前，而这种文化变革始于我们。创造意义，创造新的符号由我们决定。

- en: A few days before the start of a new decade, I sit at a quiet terrace bar in
    Hong Kong as dusk falls. The city has become a world of strange contrasts, with
    riot police standing guard outside cosmetic stores as people buy mascara, and
    police violence against protesters in luxury shopping malls. Banks and stores
    associated with the Chinese government have been shuttered; storefronts protectively
    shrouded in plaster are covered in protest graffiti. Reports of a new zoonotic
    disease from mainland China causing flu-like symptoms in humans has added to the
    city’s unease, the memory of SARS still recent. The tropical air smells faintly
    sweet, laden with the figures of Hong Kong’s colonial past and the decline of
    empire. I try the exercise posted on the Facebook page. I close my eyes. Stillness
    washes over me, like embers that quietly glow in the middle of this restive metropolis.

    and opening up my laptop again to watch *yet another video*, to sense that there
    are other paths. I sense there is something past ardent nationalism and total
    technological bliss, something past endless scrolls and lonely rage, past the
    floating world and ceaseless talk that skims across the surface like foam. Both
    nationalism and technological optimism mark the ways yearning and desire are exploited.
    They fall away in stillness. Governments drum up nationalist support, promising
    stability and control over our futures. Tech companies capitalize on this nationalism.
    Sunny ads promise frictionless prediction and control, a reassuring probability
    of a safe world, where refrigerators can order food delivery and happiness is
    guaranteed forever. A new strain of tech progressivism is equally insistent in
    our political and social lives, promising that, if we can only efficiently scale
    up our political actions and movements, if we can only optimize our good deeds,
    we will achieve the future that *we* all want. It’s that easy. But I am less curious
    about this stifling singularity and more curious about the revealed state of “interbeing”:
    a term the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh uses to replace the simple binary of

    gerenting 的可能性，冰箱可以订购食品运送和永远的幸福保证。一种新型的技术进步主义同样坚定地介入到我们的政治和社会生活中，承诺只要我们能够高效地扩大我们的政治行动和运动，只要我们能够优化我们的善行，我们就能实现*我们*所有人想要的未来。就这么简单。但我对这种压抑的单一状态不太感兴趣，更加好奇的是“相生相依”的真实状态，这是佛教僧侣释迦牟尼使用的一个术语，用以取代单一的存在和不存在二元辨证。

    more than a way for all of us to be oppressed. Most of all, the present demands
    the tender, honest work of attempting to make meaning, instead of looking, waiting,
