    through light pink flesh. “Yeah, we feed these mussels chicken and pig poop, so
    you might want to wash your hands after this,” says my host, Zhao. Inside a large
    shell about twenty centimeters tall and ten centimeters wide is a mass of pearls
    stuck to the interior. One by one, through the film of slimy water on mussel meat,
    I remove each of these pearls and put them in a red plastic bucket.

    for shelter. It’s built with torn tin, some wood, and plastic sheeting. A barking,
    mangy dog whose sole purpose is to protect these ponds from pearl thieves is chained
    next to it. Narrow, unpaved muddy roads form a grid across these ponds. There
    are some other people on small metal boats, tending to mussels. Zhao is dressed

    managed to stay clean despite the mud.

    majority come from ponds like the ones I am visiting, in a rural area near the
    city of Zhuji, in Zhejiang Province. Zhuji has been nicknamed “the Pearl City”
    because of its pearl production. I’m about an hour outside Zhuji, at a production
    site in Shanxiahu Village. Zhao, a vivacious man in his late twenties, has the
    demeanor of a Silicon Valley CEO. It’s the only way I can describe it—his mannerisms,
    his long, carefully phrased speeches that burst with excitement, his proclamations
    about how he is disrupting the pearl industry, and his inability to let any part
    of the conversation fall silent. He’s talking, telling me about his vision, asking
    his director of marketing to show me an image, trying to convince me of their
    future plans. His hair is choppily cut, and he’s constantly gesturing, pointing,
    making strange shapes using his hands that suggest boxes, clean slates, or explosions.

    is a bowl of noodles with tiny shrimps that have grown alarmingly large claws.
    Another, much more delicious, local treat is mochi-like dumplings made with sticky
    rice wrappers, filled with finely minced vegetables. “What we’re doing here,”
    he says, “we’re changing the pearl industry. We’re shaking things up. Those old

    slurps a noodle loudly and tosses an empty shrimp shell on the table.

    them under the age of thirty. If he’s the firecracker CEO who swaggers around
    with a mission, his friend who takes us out onto the mussel ponds plays the restrained,
    tireless CTO (chief technical officer) trope. Unlike the other pearl companies,
    which rely on a vast network of employees and facilities, Zhao’s company runs
    lean. They have only a few pearl ponds, emphasizing quality of pearls over quantity.
    Instead of hiring their own employees, they siphon off the services of mussel
    opening and pearl sorting from other pearl companies.

    advances have enabled more sophisticated software, such software would not exist
    without the particular working processes and collaboration methods that bind tech
    companies together. These processes that enable companies to run lean draw upon
    *gemba kaizen*, or the art of continuous improvement, pioneered by Japanese management
    consultants. *Gemba kaizen* emphasizes cutting away waste, and ensuring that workers
    and managers are aligned, decreasing miscommunications and wasted time, known
    as “thrash.” Originally used as a working process in Japanese manufacturing, agile
    methods in software are now spilling back over into other industries. Zhao’s company

    mistakes, making sure communication is clear, always syncing managers and workers
    up with one another.

    with flesh from another mussel. Each of the pearls starts off as a round piece
    of flesh from another mussel. Another thing is maintenance. The mussels are bottom-feeders,
    and we feed them chicken and pig feces. But if you put too much in, algal blooms
    start to form and choke up the mussels. Algae loves warm water, which does make
    pearls grow faster. One of the hardest parts is raising the next cycle of mussels,
    since when they reproduce, the larvae stick to fish gills. You have to really
    use a lot of water to force the larvae to come off the fish and to grow into a
    large-enough mussel.”

    area and a pioneer of the industry. While pearl farming has existed in China since
    the thirteenth century, it wasn’t until the 1980s that it became industrialized
    under China’s “reform and opening up,” initiated by Deng Xiaoping, when the state
    enacted policies for market privatization. The change in production scale demanded
    a shift in mussel species as well. Early industrial-scale farmers like Zhao’s
    father-in-law started switching to the *Hyriopsis cumingi* mussel, the “three-corner
    mussel” (*sanjiaobang*, 三角蚌), which has far higher pearl yields than traditional
    mussels. The local ecology has changed drastically since the 1980s, with waterways
    becoming inundated with excess nitrogen and phosphorus from the animal feces that
    feed the mussels.

    ponds for his mussels, the government started to regulate the industrial uses
    of public waterways in the 1990s. Farmers scrambled to turn their tiny plots of
    land into lucrative pearl ponds instead. In 2017, the town of Shanxiahu and the
    surrounding villages produced a thousand tons of pearls, making the area the global
    epicenter of cultured pearls.

    and cultivating entrepreneurship, is not new. It’s been around since the 1950s,
    with Avon makeup and Tupperware. But MLMs really began to gain traction in the
    1970s, under a branch of New Age thought called the human potential movement.
    MLMs thrived in this movement’s combination of spiritualism and self-improvement
    tied to personal wealth attainment. People like the minister and author Norman
    Vincent Peale sold the power of positive thinking and a “gospel” of prosperity,
    while entrepreneurs like William Penn Patrick pioneered the MLM tactic of charging
    sellers in his multilevel marketing company, Holiday Magic, for courses on “mind
    dynamics.” This blend of mysticism and capitalism paved the way for the 1980s,
    when multilevel marketing morphed into its current form, becoming predatory and
    insidiously corporate. This form is far more exploitative, wooing people with
    the illusion of flexible hours and “being your own boss,” only to push them deep
    into debt by getting them to purchase up front thousands of dollars’ worth of
    often unsellable, low-quality merchandise.

    a “rescue” program for those suffering from the 2008 recession. It was during

    Before I leave Zhuji, Lisa explains the process for making a wish pearl. First,
    a large triangle mussel is inoculated with small plastic balls. A coat of lacquer
    is allowed to form over a year—much less than the standard five years for a quality
    pearl. Each triangle mussel produces thirty to forty pearls. Since the excitement
    of a pearl party is in the opening up of an oyster that has one or maybe two pearls,
    the pearl farm takes small, cheap oysters, opens them up, and transfers one of
    the original pearls from the large mussel into the smaller oyster. This small
    oyster is now a wish oyster. Lisa told me that if I wanted, I could custom order
    pearls to be dyed all sorts of colors before being inserted into the smaller oyster.
    This is because pearl party hostesses often like to announce what each pearl color
    symbolizes—luck, happiness, or friendship. Each oyster is worth less than RMB
    5.

    trying is vacuum sealing the small oysters individually. Before vacuum sealing,
    the oysters are soaked in formaldehyde, a slightly carcinogenic chemical that
    stings and smells bad, preserving the dead flesh and preventing rot. Another chemical,
    which Lisa doesn’t remember the name of, is used to make sure that the small oysters
    remain closed—after all, an open oyster signals a dead oyster, and the whole point
    of a pearl party is to shuck ones that *look* alive. While vacuum sealing has
    been successful in cutting down on shipping costs, the weight of hundreds of oysters
    leads to occasional crushing. Another method is to ship the oysters in cans of
    formaldehyde. Kristie’s Krazy Kultured Pearl Parties uses oysters preserved by
    this method, I observe, as one evening Kristie remarks that her hands sting from
