- en: To keep things simple, blockchain can often be considered as a database. There
    are some similarities since the blockchain is going to store onto transactions
    as well as other records of value. However, it is not enough to say that blockchain
    is just a new database type. Yes, when you are working with a blockchain ledger,
    it will store information, but saying that it is just a database is not going
    to be enough to explain some of the neat things that this technology can do or
    the reasons that Bitcoin and other industries are applying this technology.

- en: The best way to see how the blockchain works are to compare it with traditional
    databases. With these, when you put a new transaction on the ledger, you would
    have to work with a third party that you trusted, like a financial institution
    or a government, to help record the information and keep it all safe for you.
    It was the responsibility for these third parties to help build up trust between
    themselves and their customers. For example, a bank can build up this trust because
    it has the government behind it, ensuring the money so you will always be able
    to get your money back out no matter what kind of trouble the bank runs into.

- en: This trust is really important when we complete our transactions. Any time that
    we do a transfer of money, such as when we make payments for goods and services,
    we have to trust the bank or financial institution that we work with. They will
    take the exact right amount of our accounts and then give it to the right seller.
    The seller also has to trust this system as well, trusting that the money will
    end up in their account and not get lost or be the wrong amount.

- en: Over the years, we have learned how to trust credit card companies and banks
    to do these transactions accurately for us, no matter what seller or store we
    are working with. We also trust that the company will maintain a database that
    will maintain all of the transactions and that the company will make sure that
    they keep all of your personal information safe from hackers and other individuals.
    We know that when we get onto our accounts, we will be able to see the right amount
    of money there because the financial institution has shown they can be trustworthy.

    trust and the same security without needing to rely on those third parties in
    the process. This is why blockchain is used on Bitcoin and other digital currencies.
    These currencies are still growing and haven’t had the time to build up the trust
    that is needed, so blockchain helps to add in the trust. These currencies have
    no government backing, are brand new, and just haven’t had the history to see
    how well they would do. This means that blockchain has some work ahead of it,
    but it is possible to rely on this technology to complete your transactions.

    user to gain trust inside of a system that doesn’t have a government or bank behind
    it. Anyone who is on the blockchain network will be able to view and check on
    all their transactions, which will make it easier to create transparency and some
    trust in the network.

- en: This is why right now, the most common reason for people to use blockchain ledgers
    is with Bitcoin and some of the other cryptocurrencies. This technology allows
    users to complete transactions with each other in just a few minutes while still
    keeping their information safe. However, there are a few other methods and applications
    for how you can use the blockchain technology. The blockchain can handle any kind
    of valuable information, so any industry that will handle property, shares, money
    and digital files will be able to benefit from this technology.

- en: So, now that we have spent some time talking about blockchain and some of the
    benefits that come with this technology, it is time to understand how this type
    of technology is going to work. It is pretty simple for users to use this kind
    of technology, it only takes a few minutes to do the transactions and you are
    signed up automatically when you join in a digital currency. But the things that
    happen behind the scenes are a bit more complex, which helps to provide the trust
    and security that the system needs.

    digital currencies that are out there, it is the easiest way to take a look at
    how blockchain will work on these networks. It will work similarly on other networks
    as well, but this will help to keep things in order. On the blockchain, when you
    complete a transaction, it will end up showing up, in order, on one of the blocks
    you are using. When the block is filled up, it will join in the permanent record
    and will link together with the other blocks that you have completed to form a
    chain. This all works together to help keep your information in order and keeps
    it secure from others who may want to take a look at the information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each block in the blockchain is going to be responsible for holding onto all
    the important information about the transactions that you complete and each of
    the blocks will hold onto a lot of data. Depending on the network that you work
    with, these blocks could contain information about currencies, digital rights,
    identity, and property titles to name a few. Since these blocks are able to hold
    onto so much information and will keep that information safe, blockchain is one
    of the best ways to help people interact, send money, and even make their purchases.

    address, you will join in its blockchain. Each user will receive a block that
    they will be able to fill up each time that they finish a new transaction. These
    blocks can hold onto quite a bit of information and some people will fill them
    up quickly and others may take a bit longer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the block has filled up with the different transactions that you are working
    on, they are going to become a part of the permanent record on Bitcoin. They will
    join the Bitcoin network’s blockchain, and you will start making your own personal
    blockchain, which will just contain all of the blocks that contain your own transactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When one block is all filled up, it is time to receive another block, which
    the system will send over to you automatically. You can then start to fill up
    that block with transactions as well and the process keeps going for as long as
    you keep using the network. Every user on the Bitcoin network, or whatever platform
    you are using at the time, will have their own blockchain that is full of personal
    transactions. But as the blocks fill up, those will be added to the permanent
    blockchain that the Bitcoin network relies on so the information is kept safe.
    This process works together to make sure that the Bitcoin network remains transparent
    to use.

- en: This can all seem a little bit confusing right now, but one way to think about
    how blockchain works is to think of it as your own bank statement. Each block
    that you receive will be like a monthly statement that you get from the bank.
    You can look it over to see what transactions you have completed in recent times
    and check to make sure it is all good. After you have finished a few of these
    statements, they will all become part of your bank history. They will be a part
    of your permanent record with the bank (or regarding the blockchain, with the
    Bitcoin network), and you can always look back to see what payments you made,
    what funds you received, and any other transaction. The main difference between
    these is that blockchain is going to be online and will only be in charge of things
    that happen on the Bitcoin network.

    Bitcoin in order to keep your transactions safe and secure. There are some special
    codes or some hashes that will be added in so that hackers and other people won't
    be able to steal your information. Anyone who is on the network can see these
    transactions, but they will have to look through these special hashes to see what
    is going on. It is the work of the miners on the Bitcoin network that will make
    sure the blockchain ledger is secure, and they will be rewarded with 25 Bitcoin
    each time that they are successful.

- en: The job of the miner may sound easy, but some complications can come with it,
    and they are in charge of maintaining most of the security of this system. They
    will need to come up with the unique hashes that will help to hide up all of your
    information so that it will be safe from others who want to look. But they can't
    just go through and write out any random number that they would like, or anyone
    could do this and all of the coins on Bitcoin would be mined.
  prefs: []

- en: Instead, there are a few rules to the hashes that are created. First, the beginning
    of each hash needs to have a certain number of zeroes and since you don't know
    how a hash will look until you are done, you could create quite a few of these
    before getting results. Also, the hashes have to be designed so that if any one
    character in the chain is changed, it is going to change up all of the characters
    that come after it as well. This make sit complicated to make a good hash, but
    it does make it easier to catch if someone has been messing around in the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can guess, the process of creating one of these codes is not the easiest,
    but these rules ensure that your information is going to stay safe and that not
    just anyone could add in a random code to the mix. If they could do that, then
    a code could do the work and the security would be gone. Right now, the miners
    will be rewarded with 25 Bitcoin when they are done. Since Bitcoin is worth about
    $3200 right now, this can be a good reward for the work that they are doing. This
    becomes a win-win situation for everyone who is involved. The miners will get
    paid well for the work that they are doing and the users of the network can rest
    assured that their information will stay safe.

    applications for users to enjoy. Right now, it is the leading force that has helped
    Bitcoin become so popular, but it is sure to change many other aspects of our
    world in the future. It is such a simple idea, just a ledger to keep track of
    transactions, but it is so efficient and easy to use that many platforms for different
    applications are already in use.
