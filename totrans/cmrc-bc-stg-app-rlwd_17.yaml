- en: Substandard and counterfeit drugs are a massive problem around the world, resulting
    in the deaths of up to 1 million people every year and with an estimated market
    size of 200 Billion USD. World Customs Organization's Anti-Counterfeiting and
    Piracy Coordinator Christophe Zimmerman has even made the shocking claim that
    ‘We have more fakes than real drugs in the market.’ Within the pharmaceutical
    supply chain, accountability, authentication, and visibility are of the utmost
    importance. Due to the inflexibility of legacy systems and fragmented technological
    solutions, it has become increasingly difficult to track a single packet of drugs
    from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption, and even more difficult
    to hold parties accountable when problems do arise. Legal obligations such as
    track-and-trace and the upcoming Falsified Medicines Directive (scheduled to go
    into effect in February 2019) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act – scheduled to
    go into effect in 2018 – mean that it is important for all members of the supply
    chain to be responsible for not only their operations, but for the integrity of
    their partners as well. Given this, an interoperable and collaborative solution
    will be essential not only for adapting to a shifting regulatory environment,
    but for improving patient wellbeing and saving lives.
