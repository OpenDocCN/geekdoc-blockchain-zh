- en: 'Chapter 5: JavaScript for KidsIt may be hard to believe, but there was a time
    when there was no internet! And before that, no computers either! It’s probably
    really hard to imagine a world without the two, but people used to exist and get
    by with fewer electronics.Before the invention of cellphones, people used to communicate
    via telephone or by writing letters and sending them through the post. Before
    online shopping, people had to physically go to the shops and kids had to have
    their friends in the room in order to play TV or computer games together.With
    time, all those things changed. Things became faster and easier to do, and we
    have computers to thank for that. A computer is a gadget that takes different
    kinds of information and processes it, then gives us an answer. It works the same
    way as a calculator. You tell the calculator the sum you want it to work out and
    it gives you an answer.Computers work with Operating systems. An operating system
    is a form of software that basically runs the computer. It controls the hardware
    by taking information in and giving information out. It is also responsible for
    the connection between us, the users, and the computer.These days, most people
    use computers to get on to the internet. The internet is a network that connects
    millions of computers around the world. There are so many websites that we can’t
    even count. The thing that makes these websites look cool and do amazing things
    is JavaScript.JavaScript is a language that we use to tell the computer what to
    do and how to do it. When you type something on your keyboard or scroll around
    a page with your mouse, the web page you are using responds to that. That’s because
    of JavaScript.As amazing as JavaScript is, you can’t use it on its own to build
    your website. Websites are built using three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.HTML
    lets you put content on your webpage. So all the things you can see, like text
    and pictures.CSS takes the content on your page and changes how it looks. So with
    CSS you can make your text and pictures big or small. You can change colors that
    appear on your page too !And lastly, JavaScript tells the content on your page
    how to behave. That means that it can make your text or pictures move around,
    and it can even add animation.HTML and CSSHTML is really easy to learn. It’s where
    some of the most successful programmers and software developers started, and who
    knows? You could be the next Mark Zuckerberg!HTML stands for Hypertext Markup
    Language. Hypertext describes the words or pictures on your web page that are
    hyperlinks. A hyperlink is something you can click on that takes you either to
    a different page or to a different part of the page you are already on. Markup
    Language is a collection of letters called tags that tell our web page how it
    should look.HTML can be written in the notepad app on your computer.In order to
    create a tag, we put them inside brackets that look like this <>. Some of the
    most common tags are <h> for heading, <p> for paragraph and <img> for images.Tags
    can’t be alone, they always need something in between them. The thing we put inside
    the tag is called content. The content is what actually shows up on your web page.
    We can think of the tags like ‘the boss’ because the content will always do what
    the tag says. Here’s how:At the top of your web page, you’re going to want to
    have a heading. Your main heading is going to be called <h1> so that the computer
    knows that it goes at the very top of your web page. Your heading can be whatever
    you want it to be, but for today it’s going to be ‘I am smart’. Once you put it
    inside the tags it’s going to look like this: <h1>I am smart</h1>. The two tags
    show where your heading should start and stop.CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    Cascading means things that happen in a sequence, or one after the other. If we
    think of it like a waterfall, styles can fall from one sheet to another. This
    makes it possible for lots of different styles to appear on the same HTML sheet
    and then on a webpage. Style sheets are files that have font and styling settings.Important
    JavaScript TermsWe can write JavaScript from scratch, but we don’t have to. There
    are coding libraries that exist to make it easier to write script. A coding library
    is a collection of code that has already been written. Most coding libraries are
    open source, which means they are free to download and use. An example of a coding
    library is JQuery.In JQuery’s collection of code you will find:Variables–We can
    liken a variable to a case filled with something. Variables hold one word or number
    at a time and can be sorted into one of three parts; type, name and value.Keywords–Keywords
    are words with special meanings that have been set aside by programmers.Functions–Are
    words within the script that we can use to get a task doneParameters–Sometimes
    functions need to have a bit of extra information in them so they can perform
    properly. That extra information is called a parameter. Sometimes they are called
    arguments too.Arrays–Arrays are like a bigger box for variables. They take variables
    that are alike and group them together.Data Types in JavaScriptA language is something
    people use to communicate. All Languages have words that are unique to them. The
    same goes for programming languages. They each compose their data a certain way.
    JavaScript has Primitive values and Objects.Primitive Values are forms of data
    that cannot change. In JavaScript there are seven:●     Number typeThe number
    type is used to represent all numbers. It includes integers and floating point
    values. Floating point values are numbers that have fractions.●     BigInt typeBigInt
    is short for Big Integer. An integer is a whole number without fractions. 5 is
    an integer but 5.5 is not. This data type was created for JavaScript in early
    2020 because there was a problem with the number data type. It didn’t have a number
    big enough for programmers to use, so in some situations they had problems when
    coding.●     Null typeNull is the value we use to show that there is no object.
    In real life, Imagine if you really wanted a glass of milk. You walk over to the
    fridge, grab a carton of milk and start to pour into your glass, but nothing comes
    out. Your carton of milk has a null value because it’s empty.●     Undefined typeWe
    can compare Undefined to something that is unclear. A variable that can’t be identified
    by its characteristics becomes undefined in JavaScript. A lot of people are unsure
    what the difference between Null and Undefined is.●     Symbol typeA symbol is
    the newest primitive data type, it got added to JavaScript recently. Symbols have
    a unique value and cannot be recreated. We use them when we want to assign a specific
    value to an object so that it doesn’t clash with another object.●     String typeA
    string is a chain of symbols. It could include anything from letters to numbers.●     Boolean
    typeA Boolean is a value that can represent a true or a false statement. We usually
    use it with conditional statements when coding.Objects are values that have their
    own characteristics and can be organized by type. We assign characteristics to
    an object by using variables.VariablesThe word variable means something that doesn’t
    stay the same, something that can change at any time. In JavaScript, Variables
    hold on to values that can be changed at any time. Because of this, variables
    cannot have the same name. Variables have declarations and definitions. A Declaration
    is the part of the code where the variable is before any action takes place. The
    definition is where the variable is placed once it has a value and a place in
    the code.ArraysIn JavaScript, an Array is one variable that we can use to keep
    different elements. Keeping several items of the same kind together makes it easier
    to work out where each element is by adding an offset to a base value. A real
    life example would be if a teacher had all her students sitting at their desks.
    The teacher would be able to pinpoint any student by knowing what number desk
    they’re sitting at. It makes coding easier, because we can have access to a whole
    list of elements just by typing in one word.ObjectsObjects are words in your script
    that have characteristics and can be organized by type. Those characteristics
    are usually variables determined by the programmer.Conditionals and LoopsConditional
    statements work out what is happening in your JavaScript code and then use boolean
    phrases to decide on the outcome. So the outcome on a conditional statement will
    either be true or false. There are four types of conditional statements:●     The
    if statementRuns a certain part of the code if the condition is true●     The
    else statementRuns the part of the code related to else if the condition is false●     The
    else if statementGives and tests a new condition if the first if condition is
    false●     The switch-case statementGives a number of substitute code blocks to
    be carried out based on specific conditionsLoop statements help to keep your code
    short and sweet. Sometimes, you are going to have to perform the same action a
    number of times on your web application. If loop statements didn’t exist, a programmer
    would have to write the same line of code over and over again. There are three
    types of Loop statements:●     The while loopThe while loop is straightforward.
    The while loop carries out a conditional statement over and over again if the
    statement is true. As soon as the statement becomes false, the loop stops running.●     The
    for loopThe for loop is a bit more complex. It only runs a specific number of
    times and it’s made up of three parts:-          The Loop InitializationThis gets
    your code ready to receive a starting value. This happens before the loop starts.-          The
    Test StatementTests if a condition is true. If it is true, then the loop will
    run. If it’s not true, then the loop will not run.-          The Iteration StatementLets
    you increase or decrease the number of times your loop runs●     The for..in loopAs
    we read before, objects have properties. The for..in loop’s purpose is to loop
    through an object’s characteristics.FunctionsFunctions are used to wrap a specific
    piece of your code so you can reuse it without having to type it out more than
    once. Sometimes a developer needs the same action to take place on different parts
    or pages of the same website. Functions can be broken down into three parts:Function
    StatementThe function statement reveals a function. The function gets saved and
    only works when it is called for.Function ExpressionA function expression does
    not give the name of the function. The name can be left out of the line of code
    and create an anonymous function.Function DeclarationNames a function with its
    special parametersThree Ways to Write Your First Line of CodeThe first way you
    can practice writing some code is to write it directly into the Browser. It’s
    really easy because you don’t need to set anything up and you can start off by
    trying out some simple comments.● First, open your web browser and find the search
    box.● Type in about:blank and click enter–Your browser tab should be empty.● Click
    on the menu and choose tools or more tools depending on your browser.●     Choose
    Developer tools–A developer tag should appear.●     Click on Console.●     Type
    your first line of code!Once you have gotten used to writing and using some basic
    HTML tags and content, you are going to need to be able to save your code and
    you might want to use lots of commands at the same time. For that you have to
    write your code in a simple text file and then send it to the browser so you can
    view it. Browsers accept files with the extension .html. You can create HTML files
    with Notepad in windows and with Textedit on Mac. Once you have written your code
    into the file, you need to change the format to HTML.On Windows:●     Open Notepad●     Define
    the document type by typing in <!DOCTYPE html>●     Type in some tags and content
    e.g.:<h1>I AM SMART</h1><p> I can code! </p>●     Click on file in the top left
    corner●     Click on Save as●     Look for: Save as type● Click on the drop down
    menu and choose the .html file extension.●     Save your documentOn Mac:●     Open
    Textedit● Go to the very top of the page and click on preferences●     Choose
    the plain text option●     Define the document type●     Type in some tags and
    content● Click save and type .html at the end of your document name●     Save
    your documentYou have to be very careful, because you will be writing code all
    by yourself.Another way you can write your code is with Special Code Editors.
    Special Code Editors know lots of programming languages and they have special
    features to help you write your code. They highlight different keywords and let
    you know when there is a syntax error. An editor that is available for free online
    is Visual Studio Code.Now that you have a basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript,
    challenge yourself and do even more research. By the end of your coding journey
    you should be able to create beautiful websites, build games and construct really
    cool mobile apps.'
