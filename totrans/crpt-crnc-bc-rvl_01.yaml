- en: Over thousands of years, people have employed many different kinds of money—from
    beads to metal coins and from shells to coffee beans. Some forms of money are
    more effective than others. “To be a really good currency,” wrote economist and
    Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, “it needs to be durable, portable, divisible,
    uniform, limited in supply, and acceptable.”

  zh: 在数千年的历史中，人们使用了多种不同的货币——从珠子到金属硬币，从贝壳到咖啡豆。有些货币形式比其他形式更有效。“要成为真正好的货币，”经济学家、《金融时报》专栏作家马丁·沃尔夫写道，“它需要持久、便携、可分、统一、供应有限，且被接受。”
- en: Today, most people use fiat money, or what we would recognize as coins and paper
    bills. Fiat money is made legal tender, or currency, by government regulation.
    This money actually has no intrinsic value on its own. People give and receive
    money for real goods and services because it is a socially accepted symbol of
    value. Citizens must also use it to pay their taxes.

  zh: 今天，大多数人使用法定货币，即我们所说的硬币和纸币。法定货币是由政府规定作为法定货币的。这种货币本身并没有内在价值。人们为真正的商品和服务给出和接收货币，因为它是一个被社会接受的价值观符号。公民还必须使用它来支付税款。
- en: However, it can be unnerving to realize that fiat money is based mostly on trust.
    Citizens have to believe that the government won’t simply make more when it needs
    to. When the government prints too much money, inflation rises. The value of the
    currency declines because it doesn’t buy as much as it used to. Hyperinflation
    occurs when the currency loses its value. When a society loses faith in its currency,
    the results can be catastrophic. Citizens can’t afford food, savings are destroyed,
    and law and order breaks down.

  zh: 然而，意识到法定货币主要基于信任可能会令人不安。公民必须相信政府在其需要时不会简单地制造更多货币。当政府发行过多货币时，通货膨胀就会上升。货币的价值下降，因为它不再像以前那样购买力强。当货币失去其价值时，就会发生超级通货膨胀。当一个社会对其货币失去信心时，结果可能是灾难性的。公民买不起食物，储蓄被摧毁，法律和秩序崩溃。

- en: There are many ways in which creators of a product deliberately limit supply.
    In the late 1990s, music was primarily available only on compact discs (CDs).
    If you wanted a song, you had to buy an individual copy, which you usually got
    only if you purchased the whole album. Once you owned the CD, you could not make
    copies. If you wanted to share the song with a friend, they had to borrow your
    CD (in which case you couldn’t listen to it). This was also true of most other
    forms of media—newspapers, books, and DVDs. It is no surprise that these industries
