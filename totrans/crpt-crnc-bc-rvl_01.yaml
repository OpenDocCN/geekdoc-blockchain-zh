    beads to metal coins and from shells to coffee beans. Some forms of money are
    more effective than others. “To be a really good currency,” wrote economist and
    Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, “it needs to be durable, portable, divisible,
    uniform, limited in supply, and acceptable.”

- en: Today, most people use fiat money, or what we would recognize as coins and paper
    bills. Fiat money is made legal tender, or currency, by government regulation.
    This money actually has no intrinsic value on its own. People give and receive
    money for real goods and services because it is a socially accepted symbol of
    value. Citizens must also use it to pay their taxes.

    Citizens have to believe that the government won’t simply make more when it needs
    to. When the government prints too much money, inflation rises. The value of the
    currency declines because it doesn’t buy as much as it used to. Hyperinflation
    occurs when the currency loses its value. When a society loses faith in its currency,
    the results can be catastrophic. Citizens can’t afford food, savings are destroyed,
    and law and order breaks down.

    collect it, and monitor it. Some people believe that the government won’t properly
    oversee the financial system, which is charged with holding savings, making loans,
    and investing. If the government fails in this role, citizens’ savings would be

    In the United States, millions of home mortgages had been given to people who
    were unable to repay them. These mortgages had been repackaged into securities
    that had been sold to banks and other financial institutions around the world.

    In the late 1990s, music was primarily available only on compact discs (CDs).
    If you wanted a song, you had to buy an individual copy, which you usually got
    only if you purchased the whole album. Once you owned the CD, you could not make
    copies. If you wanted to share the song with a friend, they had to borrow your
    CD (in which case you couldn’t listen to it). This was also true of most other
    forms of media—newspapers, books, and DVDs. It is no surprise that these industries
    enjoyed strong profits in the late 1990s.

    the desire people have for it (demand). If something is rare and highly desirable
    (such as a house on a beach), then it will carry a high price. If something is
    common (such as sand) and exceeds demand, then the price will be low. Fiat currencies
    usually lose trust when governments print too much of it, causing it to lose value.

- en: Blockchain is an online ledger, or a list of records. It identifies who owns
    something at any given time. One group of Chinese blockchain experts called it
    “the latest and most trustworthy form of bookkeeping.” Each record is time-stamped
    and combined with other records via cryptography to create a block. The blocks
    are independently checked and validated by a peer-to-peer network, which consists
    of independent computers all over the world. They combine the blocks into a chain
    (hence the “blockchain”), including the most recent transactions.

    you are the current owner and then confirm the new owner. The peer-to-peer network

    and distributed to anyone else. There is only one file. Thus, blockchain effectively
    solves the problem of digitization and makes a digital currency possible.

    trace: a few telling knots, or a change in the knit. In a blockchain system, too,

    numbers. Nothing else is associated with them—no names, no social security numbers,
    and no business or residential addresses that would identify the owner. Each Bitcoin
    address has a secret code, or a private key, that allows someone to access it.

    The verification involves solving a complicated math problem—or proof of work—that
    requires significant computing power and energy. The third parties, called miners,
    are compensated for their work by being paid a fraction of the transaction in
    Bitcoin. They also receive a block reward, or a certain quantity of newly generated
    Bitcoin. The miners race to validate the transactions, and the reward goes to
    the miner who completes the proof of work the fastest and most thoroughly.

- en: Each transaction is recorded through an algorithm that takes its details—time,
    amounts, and sender and recipient addresses—and converts the transaction into
    a string of letters and numbers called a hash. Anyone running the information
    through the algorithm will come back with the same hash. Each hash can be combined
    with another, resulting in a new hash that embodies both. Thus, when a miner adds
    a block to the blockchain, it is linked to a chain of hashes that go back all
    the way to the first, or “Genesis,” block launched by Nakamoto on January 3, 2009.

- en: Any alteration to the chain, no matter how insignificant, results in a completely
    different hash. Consequently, the record of a transaction cannot be changed because
    many independent parties have already confirmed the information. After a miner
    verifies the transaction, other computers on the peer-to-peer network, called
    nodes, will validate the miner’s work with the original blockchain. If a node
    detects an irregularity, they will not attach a new block to it. Rather, they
    will go back to an earlier part of the chain that can be trusted and attach it
    there. The rejected block becomes an “orphan.” Orphans also result from situations
    where two miners solve the proof-of-work problem at the same time—the network
    has to choose one of the two blocks, and the rejected one becomes an orphan. Because
    of this process, any blockchain user can trust the ledger’s information because
    the peer-to-peer network has already confirmed it.

    Sometimes, though, it can take just a few minutes or as long as an hour. If many
    Bitcoins are being mined and require more computing power, Nakamoto’s algorithms
    automatically adjust, making them easier to mine. However, if fewer blocks are
    being mined, the difficulty is increased. The goal is to maintain a mining time
    of ten minutes per block.
