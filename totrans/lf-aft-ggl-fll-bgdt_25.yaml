    is confirmed when at least half the participants in the bitcoin verification process—the
    “miners”—hash the block mathematically with all the previous blocks since the
    Genesis block. In order to change or rescind a transaction, therefore, more than
    half the computers in the system have to agree to recompute and restate all the
    transactions since Genesis.

    the discoveries of computer science. By showing that mathematics could not be
    hermetically sealed or physically determinist, Gödel opened the way to postmodern
    mathematics: a mathematics of software and creativity. John von Neumann (1903–1957)

    rhodium, palladium, silver, platinum, and gold. Rhodium and palladium are rare
    elements that were not discovered until the eighteenth century. Platinum’s melting
    point is three thousand degrees Fahrenheit, making it unworkable without advanced
    technology. Silver tarnishes and corrodes, and its reactivity makes it more tractable
    for most industrial purposes than gold. Only gold can function as a durable and
    unchanging measuring stick for value. Usually thought to be money because it is
    a useful commodity—pretty, shiny, divisible, portable, scarce, and convertible
    into jewelry—gold is in fact the monetary element because it is useless. Money
    is not valuable because it is really jewelry; jewelry is valuable because it is
    really money. Gold is a metric of valuation based on the time to extract an incremental
    ounce, which has changed little over the centuries, while gold has become more
    difficult to extract from deeper and more attenuated lodes. The gold metric is
