- en: The growth of billions of data-intensive apps has worsened the problem of restricted
    data throughput in the 5G wireless communication network. To solve this challenge,
    researchers are creating state-of-the-art technologies to fulfill the increasing
    wireless needs of the 6G wireless communication standards. Although certain candidate
    technologies from the 5G standards will apply to 6G wireless networks, significant
    disruptive technologies that will ensure the requisite quality of physical experience
    to enable universal wireless connection are expected in 6G. To understand the
    vision and objectives of 6G, this book chapter will first offer a basic background
    on the history of several wireless communication technologies. Second, we present
    a broad overview of the suggested supporting technologies for 6G and new 6G applications
    such as multi-sensory, extended reality, digital replica, and blockchain. Also,
    this chapter includes a special section based on the economic impact of AI-enabled
    blockchain in the 6G based Industry. Following that, the technology-driven difficulties,
    social, psychological, health, and commercialization issues faced by implementing
    6G, as well as potential solutions to these challenges, are thoroughly explored.

    modern renewable energy is a dominant solution. Clean energy is known as green
    energy that can be used to offset conventional energy because it releases fewer
    pollutants and is renewable. As a result, green energy infrastructure and platforms
    are increasingly being built, and there is an increasing need for renewable energy
    expansion.

    resources, which could be used in the future, using the blockchain. A blockchain
    is an open leader, where all transactions online are registered and all transactions
    can be bound, submitted, or checked. Blockchain is a digitalized accounting records
    scheme, whereby all transactions are recorded in detail according to a series
    of cryptographic principles to avoid illicit interference [[2](#CR2)].

    it is built on smart contracts. Different exchange criteria can be set, but the

    more effectively by establishing a nontraditional active energy trading network.

    the blocks are clustered into chains, the blockchain is named. In the blockchain
    per network, the user distributes and stores data from the history of transactions
    in block format. Since any node has a single private key and public key, the secret
    key and the hash function can be used to carry out a cryptographic signature on
    the transaction. Each node uses the public key to check that the transaction has
    indeed been signed by the digital signature subject [[3](#CR3)]. The block that
    includes this transaction has a structure of “chains” that are constantly linked
    after a certain cycle during the time flow. Each user can review their transaction
    history by reading their logs since every user has a transaction history. Transactions
    not authenticated cannot then be stored in the block. Blockchain thus has three
    features: data confidentiality, safety, and decentralization [[4](#CR4)].'

    that can be stored in an immutable ledger immediately, shared and fully open,
    and which can be accessed by approved network members only. A network of blockchains
    will monitor orders, transfers, accounts, development, and much more. And because
    participants have a common understanding of the facts, all the transaction information
    is end-to-end and gives you increased interest and new efficiencies.

    regarding interoperability as solutions are deployed, resulting in new data silos.
