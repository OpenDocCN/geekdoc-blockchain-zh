- en: We live in a time of accelerated change and today’s world is changing faster
    than we have ever seen before. The end of the 19th century and beginning of the
    20th century were a period of technological upheaval and re-concentration of populations
    into urbanised centres. These shifts were made possible by the massive infrastructure
    projects that saw canals and railways connect cities and ports with producers
    of agriculture and mining. Communications systems were revolutionised by the laying
    of telegraph cable and the invention of flight. Now, in the 21st century, new
    technologies are driving even more dramatic changes in the way we live, work,
    and socialise. These developments and innovations challenge traditional ways of
    distributing goods and services, doing business, and making payments.

    and how we recall those memories. Decision-making has become something we do in
    concert with machines. With the advance of technology, we have the potential to
    create a world in which technology is used for good, while ensuring that the privacy
    of consumers is respected, a world where data is owned by individuals and used
    to improve the lives of all—essentially, a world that is better for all. In the

    Decreasing availability of resources due to regional effects of climate change—such
    as drought and desertification—leads to intensified competition for these resources.
    And this, when compounded by pressures such as rapid population growth, tribalism,
    and sectarianism (as in Darfur and Somalia), could result in armed violence. As

    (disinformation) or inadvertent (misinformation), ‘fake news’ is a term that connotes
    manipulated reporting and information about political, historical, economic, or
    social events and phenomena. With the rise of social media and the ease with which
    news and current affairs are reported and distributed via the internet, reporting
    on the conduct of our institutions has become more problematic. News reporting
    has changed utterly over the past decade and traditional methods of disseminating
    what happens in parliament, in court, and in public have shifted to news consumers.
    With hand-held devices that record with clarity both sound and video, people are
    instant reporters and publishers of events as they unfold in real time. The problem
    is that the lens of a phone has a limited point of view and it is difficult to
    reveal situation and context. Rationalising data and facts has become more challenging
    than ever. Distinguishing satire and parody from serious discourse can have significant
    consequences. Reporting on complex scientific or legal issues requires expertise
    [17]. In 2017, fake news became known to the larger public with the election of
    Donald Trump as President of the United States of America. With his constant remarks
    on ‘The Fake Media’, Donald Trump defined a new era in journalism, an era of which
    we should not be proud. His remarks demonstrate the significant influence that
    tech giants such as Facebook and Google have on the propagation of fake news.
    Digital Deceit, a 2018 report co-authored by Dipayan Gosh, previously a privacy
    and public policy adviser for Facebook, shows that the central problem is that
    an entire industry is founded on advanced technology that is purely focused on
    driving traffic and selling advertising. Of course, nefarious actors can benefit
    from this advanced potential to target specific demographics. Meanwhile, social
    media platforms such as Facebook benefit financially from these arrangements and
    so have no inherent motivation to prevent the distribution of fake news. Accordingly
    Gosh considers that disinformation operators can ‘leverage this system for precision
    propaganda [and] the harm to the public interest, the political culture, and the
    integrity of democracy is substantial and distinct from any other type of advertiser’
    [18, p. 4].

    Gosh于2018年共同撰写的报告《数字欺骗》显示，核心问题是整个行业建立在纯粹专注于推动流量和销售广告的高级技术之上。当然，邪恶的行为者可以利用这种先进的能力针对特定的受众群体。与此同时，像Facebook这样的社交媒体平台从这些安排中获得了经济利益，因此没有内在的动力阻止假新闻的传播。因此Gosh认为，虚假信息操作员可以“利用这个系统进行精确宣传[以及对公众利益、政治文化和民主诚信的损害]与其他类型的广告商明显不同”[18,

    are critical to the success of many development programmes. Traditionally, personal
    identification has been a two-step process: the person seeking to prove their
    identity produced a physical artefact (for example, a credit card with a data-loaded
    magnetic strip). In conjunction with using this, they rely on a pin or password
    or receipt of a four-digit code on their device. The problem with this process
    is that, if the person has lost or does not have the physical device or ID, then
    they may face being locked out of the service or system they seek to use. For
    this reason, many authorities are exploring replacing the card with the use of
    the person’s mobile phone number. If you include the country code, all mobile
    numbers are unique. More recently, biometric identification (for example, matching
    data banks of fingerprint images with a given sample) and facial recognition technology

    five years (2005–2010). This apparently good news is soon tempered by the reality

    five years. The Report also identified that the effective tracking of progress
