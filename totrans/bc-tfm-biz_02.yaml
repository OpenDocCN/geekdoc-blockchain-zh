    than we have ever seen before. The end of the 19th century and beginning of the
    20th century were a period of technological upheaval and re-concentration of populations
    into urbanised centres. These shifts were made possible by the massive infrastructure
    projects that saw canals and railways connect cities and ports with producers
    of agriculture and mining. Communications systems were revolutionised by the laying
    of telegraph cable and the invention of flight. Now, in the 21st century, new
    technologies are driving even more dramatic changes in the way we live, work,
    and socialise. These developments and innovations challenge traditional ways of
    distributing goods and services, doing business, and making payments.

    and the Internet of Things has changed how we store information, how we remember,
    and how we recall those memories. Decision-making has become something we do in
    concert with machines. With the advance of technology, we have the potential to
    create a world in which technology is used for good, while ensuring that the privacy
    of consumers is respected, a world where data is owned by individuals and used
    to improve the lives of all—essentially, a world that is better for all. In the
    future, it is all about algorithms, machine learning, big data, and artificial
    intelligence. This change comes about because of the development of robotics,
    3D printing and augmented reality, nanotechnology, and quantum computing. There
    is disruption at all levels, resulting in system-wide innovations that can revolutionise
    an industry in years, rather than decades.

    in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian
    nature, as well as promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental
    freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.
    In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights brought human dignity and fairness
    into the realm of international law. Since then, the UN has diligently protected
    human rights through legal instruments and on-the-ground activities. Human rights,

    growth mainly due to a reduction in mortality. The period 1950–1965 saw the fastest

    scarcity and climate change can create or exacerbate conflict. In 2007, UN Secretary
    General Ban Ki-moon described the conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region as the world’s
    first climate change conflict [12]. The assumption was that water scarcity from
    changed rainfall patterns, caused by climate change, contributed to this conflict.
    His thinking reflects the findings to date that the incidence of conflict is likely
    to be higher in years of lower precipitation [12, 13]. With rising water levels
    caused by melting polar ice caps, island nations and low-lying areas will soon
    need to move their inhabitants to higher ground. Island nations such as Kiribati
    and the Maldives, which have no natural high ground, will have to choose between
    sinking and shifting. To deal with these challenges and defend against changing
    conditions, these countries need to advance economically, although, in a seemingly
    paradoxical twist, their economic woes are underpinned by climate change.

    that scientific discourse should be based on exact data undermines the overall
    message. A lack of political will in some parts of the world to accept climate
    change being caused by human activity is in part driven by the prohibitive cost
    of dealing with it. Political parties and politicians all over the world are prepared
    to include tackling climate change in their campaign speeches, but the harsh reality
    of how environmentally-friendly policies will impact on the electorate and the
    economy in any given election cycle is political poison. Manufacturing, transportation,

    may arise as a result of climate change [14, p. 19, 15, p. 22]. Many important
    aspects of human development also relate to people’s security. In this way, ‘human
    security’ can be defined as people’s freedom from fear and freedom from want in
    a broad sense. Human security has always been tied to climate because want causes
    fear and conflict. Climate security focuses on the needs of individuals and communities
    and the idea of freedom from harm and fear. People need to be able to adapt in
    the face of any imposed harm. From this human security perspective, the central
    analytical issues are vulnerability, adaptation, and justice.

    evolved to a place where they now constitute a recognised and important component
    in the climate-change conversation, and are being addressed at a diverse range
    of forums through meetings, reports, and changes in policy. Societies with more
    climate-sensitive economies, largely in the developing world, will be most affected
    because climate change acts as a ‘threat multiplier’ and adds to existing burdens.
    Decreasing availability of resources due to regional effects of climate change—such
    as drought and desertification—leads to intensified competition for these resources.
    And this, when compounded by pressures such as rapid population growth, tribalism,
    and sectarianism (as in Darfur and Somalia), could result in armed violence. As
    meteorological disasters become more frequent and intense with global warming,
    already struggling societies will be weakened further, making them more vulnerable
    to political instability, as in Haiti. It therefore follows that global warming
    may directly increase conflict. It is these issues that drive the UN’s Sustainable

    people will be willing and able to be guided by it [16]. At the core of these

    law and everyone is innocent until proven guilty. In addition to these process-driven
    values, there is a body of rights or truths within the rule of law that ensures
    dignity, free speech, and privacy. Of course, these private rights may from time

    (disinformation) or inadvertent (misinformation), ‘fake news’ is a term that connotes
    manipulated reporting and information about political, historical, economic, or
    social events and phenomena. With the rise of social media and the ease with which
    news and current affairs are reported and distributed via the internet, reporting
    on the conduct of our institutions has become more problematic. News reporting
    has changed utterly over the past decade and traditional methods of disseminating
    what happens in parliament, in court, and in public have shifted to news consumers.
    With hand-held devices that record with clarity both sound and video, people are
    instant reporters and publishers of events as they unfold in real time. The problem
    is that the lens of a phone has a limited point of view and it is difficult to
    reveal situation and context. Rationalising data and facts has become more challenging
    than ever. Distinguishing satire and parody from serious discourse can have significant
    consequences. Reporting on complex scientific or legal issues requires expertise
    [17]. In 2017, fake news became known to the larger public with the election of
    Donald Trump as President of the United States of America. With his constant remarks
    on ‘The Fake Media’, Donald Trump defined a new era in journalism, an era of which
    we should not be proud. His remarks demonstrate the significant influence that
    tech giants such as Facebook and Google have on the propagation of fake news.
    Digital Deceit, a 2018 report co-authored by Dipayan Gosh, previously a privacy
    and public policy adviser for Facebook, shows that the central problem is that
    an entire industry is founded on advanced technology that is purely focused on
    driving traffic and selling advertising. Of course, nefarious actors can benefit
    from this advanced potential to target specific demographics. Meanwhile, social
    media platforms such as Facebook benefit financially from these arrangements and
    so have no inherent motivation to prevent the distribution of fake news. Accordingly
    Gosh considers that disinformation operators can ‘leverage this system for precision
    propaganda [and] the harm to the public interest, the political culture, and the
    integrity of democracy is substantial and distinct from any other type of advertiser’
    [18, p. 4].

    most important protocol developments supporting blockchain applications. Although

    Blockchain’s crypto-mechanism gives users in a digital network the power to rate,

    use such technology to establish robust personal identification systems, which
    are critical to the success of many development programmes. Traditionally, personal
    identification has been a two-step process: the person seeking to prove their
    identity produced a physical artefact (for example, a credit card with a data-loaded
    magnetic strip). In conjunction with using this, they rely on a pin or password
    or receipt of a four-digit code on their device. The problem with this process
    is that, if the person has lost or does not have the physical device or ID, then
    they may face being locked out of the service or system they seek to use. For
    this reason, many authorities are exploring replacing the card with the use of

    provenance, and transactions can also break down the barriers that have impeded
    previous attempts to end poverty, deliver sustainable energy, reduce inequality,
    and increase the accountability of institutions. Ultimately, what blockchain creates
    is a relationship of trust between users and content. Blockchain technology allows
    all users to see and verify all transactions and settlements, thereby removing
    the need for a third party or intermediary to manage counter-party risk or escrow
    funds. This capacity to manage and monitor exchanges can be applied to the exchanges
    of non-financial assets, including information, provenance, identity, and data.

    aims articulated in five of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. These Goals
    are the eradication of poverty, availability of decent work and economic growth,
    support for industry innovation and infrastructure, systems for responsible consumption
    and production, and peace, justice, and strong institutions.

    livelihood. Its manifestations include social discrimination and exclusion as
    well as the lack of participation in decision-making. Those who do not have access
    to education, land, or the labour market cannot fully contribute to society or
    the economy [26]. The social inclusion of people living in poverty is not just
    a fundamental moral imperative—it can also help to reduce economic and social
    costs by providing sustainable jobs. According to the UN, a key requirement for
    economic equality and progress is financial transparency [27]. Technological progress
    is the foundation of efforts to achieve environmental objectives, such as increased
    resource and energy efficiency. The relationship between human development and
    climate is inextricably linked. When climate is extreme and intemperate for long
    periods, resources become scarce. When resources are scarce, conflict and fear
    soon set it. Countries that rely on agrarian economies soon become vulnerable.
    Without technology and innovation industrialisation will not happen, and without
    industrialisation development cannot happen [28].

    authentication of transactions can enable and ensure financial inclusion, respect
    for provenance, and the verification of human identity. However, before we examine
    each of the seven Wicked Problems and our proposed blockchain-based solutions,
    it is important first to understand the particular features of blockchain technology
    that make these proposed solutions possible.
