    room only. With the tension simmering between me and Benedict, we decided to offer
    them as online webinars, which would be easier to stage and attract an even bigger

- en: “Nimit,” I began, “I read that you grew up in India during the eighties, when
    the prime minister was assassinated. In the political aftermath, you saw people
    forced to vote at gunpoint. That image really stuck with you. So how did you get
    from there to a blockchain-based voting platform?”^([39](notes.html#ch00-fn39))

- en: Nimit was a tall, bearded entrepreneur who looked the part of a humble tech
    genius. “In 2014 my brother and I were just starting to learn about blockchain.”
    He was so soft-spoken that I had a hard time hearing him. “When we took a look
    at the underlying tech, we were, like, ‘Wow, this is very powerful. You can use
    it to secure any kind of digital data.’ Elections and voting data seemed like
    a good fit.”

    选举和投票数据似乎是一个很好的匹配。”

    room, and a hackathon was happening. It was completely unplanned.

- en: '“So we built this blockchain prototype focused on one particular use case:
    how to detect and prevent voter coercion when people vote from home. We ended
    up winning first prize and it kick-started our company. Since then, it’s blossomed
    into a full-fledged elections platform which uses smartphones and biometrics,
    then records the votes on the blockchain.”'

- en: “And it’s being used in real elections,” I pointed out. “You’ve handled more
    than seventy-five thousand votes across thirty test elections.” I looked at the
    camera and addressed the multitudes. “If you’re new to blockchain, let me explain
    how a blockchain-based voting system might work.”

    his words carefully. “People have tried this idea in South America, and it gets

    like Voatz have to get election officials on board. They do this through small

    get people used to voting via app. Then blockchain goes big time.
