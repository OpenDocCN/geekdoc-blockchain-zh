    room only. With the tension simmering between me and Benedict, we decided to offer
    them as online webinars, which would be easier to stage and attract an even bigger

    the prime minister was assassinated. In the political aftermath, you saw people
    forced to vote at gunpoint. That image really stuck with you. So how did you get
    from there to a blockchain-based voting platform?”^([39](notes.html#ch00-fn39))

    genius. “In 2014 my brother and I were just starting to learn about blockchain.”
    He was so soft-spoken that I had a hard time hearing him. “When we took a look
    at the underlying tech, we were, like, ‘Wow, this is very powerful. You can use
    it to secure any kind of digital data.’ Elections and voting data seemed like
    a good fit.”

    how to detect and prevent voter coercion when people vote from home. We ended

    then records the votes on the blockchain.”'

    how a blockchain-based voting system might work.”

    it VoterChain.) You simply open the VoterChain app on your phone, verify your
    ID, then cast your vote. Your vote is anonymous (I can’t see what you voted) but
    auditable (I can see what everyone voted in total).

    Nicolás Maduro that they organized mass protests, demanding his resignation—protests
    that left ninety citizens dead in 2017.^([41](notes.html#ch00-fn41)) Imagine if
    VoterChain was open for the world to see what Venezuela really wanted. What would
    we discover?

    all the people. But by offering a decentralized alternative to centralized elections,
    it can truly represent the will of the people.

    all sides of the political spectrum,” Nimit replied. I sensed that he was choosing
    his words carefully. “People have tried this idea in South America, and it gets
    really partisan really quickly. So that defeats the noble objectives you are trying
    to achieve. Get all the stakeholders on board, even your election officials.”

- en: I realized that Nimit’s technology was inherently political. To succeed, platforms
    like Voatz have to get election officials on board. They do this through small
    tests—absentee ballots, town votes, polling on citizen issues—work out the kinks,
    get people used to voting via app. Then blockchain goes big time.
