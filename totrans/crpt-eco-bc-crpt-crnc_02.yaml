    Yet after a certain period of time, some of the robotic hosts begin to develop

    to define themselves existentially.

    Bitcoin was the real breakthrough. Blockchain supports Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies)
    by storing all the transaction information into the chain (to avoid double spending
    and provide total transparency). It is also a decentralizing force that reshapes
    the power structure of regulation.

    the world instead of held on a central server. All transactions put into the block
    are validated by all the notes in the blockchain. It eliminates the need for trust
    by providing verification. It is impossible to change a block in the blockchain
    once is it created (and added to the public chain). Therefore, to fool the blockchain,
    you would need to control over 51 percent of the notes—a feat that could technically
    be done, but whose cost would be unbearable.

    a public blockchain, a private blockchain, or a consortium blockchain.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    participate in it and can and be part of the validation process for transactions.
    Data on a public blockchain are likewise accessible to everyone. Reaching a distributed
    consensus on this type of blockchain makes the whole system run transparently
    and securely. Examples of public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Private blockchains, in contrast, are usually built by large companies for their
    own use alone. In contrast to a public blockchain (which runs without the need
    for trust), a private blockchain relies very much on trust among authorized people
    who have been granted access. Unlike the decentralization offered with a public
    blockchain, this type of blockchain is centralized, with access provided only
    to a limited number of users. You might think of this category as a kind of customized
    “blockchain on demand.” Many different institutes and organizations have designed
    private blockchains based on their unique needs and will continue to do so in
    the future.

    You might say that it’s in between a public blockchain and a private blockchain—partially
    decentralized. It enables two companies to share data that have been separately
    saved on each private blockchain.

    Public blockchain creates a decentralized environment for information to flow
    without barriers. Private blockchain and consortium blockchains are more efficient
    in terms of privacy and purpose but are most applicable to organizations and companies
    that need their information made available only within certain limits.

    a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts and allows developers to build
    their apps on the blockchain created by Ethereum. Smart contract is key in Ethereum,
    since it finally allows cryptocurrencies to be used in broader business activities.
    Smart contract can function in the absence of trust, because it executes terms
    without intervention from the parties involved. Once a smart contract is generated,
    it cannot be reversed. Transactions are traceable but irreversible. A smart contract
    works on an “if-then” language. If A happens, then B will take place. So once
    a contract is set up, the terms will be executed automatically.

    receipt. And I, as landlord, will give you a key to enter the apartment within
    a certain period of time. If the key is not delivered to you on time, the blockchain
    will return the advance to you. If the key is delivered before the agreed date,
    the blockchain will temporarily hold the key until you pay the advance.

    contract will be automatically terminated once the terms have been fulfilled.

    contract has the potential to decentralize the entire contract market. Assets

    contract broadens the potential use of blockchain dramatically—potentially bringing

    that hold our personal data, financial data, and professional data on their servers.
    The importance of replacing third parties is all about security. Third parties
    makes it easier for hackers to hack, since everyone’s data are all in one place

    can use to build and deploy decentralized applications. The first generation of
    applications on blockchain is, admittedly, quite limited. The blockchain Bitcoin
    uses merely focuses on transactions (and tracking of transactions) using Bitcoins.
    The use of first-generation blockchain is also very narrowly defined. However,
    Ethereum is offering a public blockchain that goes beyond a peer-to-peer electronic
    cash system. By implementing smart contracts, the use of blockchain has the potential
    to expand beyond cryptocurrency. Anything of value can now be exchanged with and
    through smart contracts. Agreements and exchanges of every sort can theoretically
    run on Ethereum.

    along with a few members of the Ethereum team. In doing so, he also announced
    the concept of the DAO—the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Despite very
    little information about what the DAO actually was, during its Initial Coin Offering
    (ICO), the DAO raised an amount of Ethereum equal to $150 million from over 20,000
    investors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, on June 17, 2016, a hacker hacked the DAO through a loophole in the
    system. Within just a couple of hours, the DAO lost 3.6 million ETH, the equivalent
    of $70 million. The loophole facilitating this hacking did not come from Ethereum
    itself, but from an application on which it was built. However, the resulting
    mess was left to the Ethereum team and community to take care of. Several proposals
    were presented to get the stolen money back. Because transferred funds were always
    held in an account for twenty-eight days, the hacker couldn’t simply take the
    money and run. Ethereum eventually proposed to “hardfork” the funds to an account
    available to the original owners. A hardfork involves making a primordial change
    to blockchain that can make previously invalid transactions valid, or vice versa.
    But by doing so, it subverts the shared goal of decentralization that so many
    people involved in cryptocurrency share. Eventually, even though 10 percent of
    the Ethereum community voted against it, Ethereum decided to hardfork 192 million
    blocks in order to retrieve the stolen funds. After this was done, a new blockchain
    was created called ETH (separate from the original blockchain, ETC).

    contracts is something new, and so is everything related to blockchain. In my

    long as we survive and learn from our mistakes, we shall all be stronger in the

    active ICO projects are now using smart contracts. Tokens and the ownership of
    tokens will also always be written into a smart contract. For example, in a typical
    ICO, 10 percent of tokens are reserved to the ICO team, 50 percent of tokens go
    to private investors, and 40 percent go to public investors. And all of these
    conditions will be written into the smart contract, which is accessible to everyone

    for blockchain startups to raise money. But ICOs can be initiated by unsavory
    people who are only in it for quick profits at the expense of other people. These
    days, there is more awareness of this danger. However, in the early days of ICOs,
    token sales were always great, but some of them were being sold by scammers. In
    the second stage—the one we’re in now—as ICOs evolve into something more professional
    and transparent, they are attracting individuals and institutions from the traditional
    financial industry. There are advantages to this, yes, but it can also make things
    more standardized and slow things down. Blockchain, as an industry, is gathering
    experts and high-profile managers from across traditional industries and is improving

    Launching an ICO is now as demanding as launching an IPO. It involves nearly everything
    that an IPO requires. Cryptocurrency and blockchain are interlinked so closely.
    Cryptocurrencies are supporting blockchain startups, and blockchain startups are
    relying on tokens to be issued and token sales to raise capital to grow bigger.
