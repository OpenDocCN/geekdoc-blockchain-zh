    just text, which is ironic for a system known for being digital money. While that
    text is widely regarded as a criticism of the world’s central banks (the reason
    Bitcoin was being invented), the fact that the first block wasn’t money shows
    the true value of blockchain technology: it can serve as a repository of *data.*'

    a record of your deposit on its ledger system. That’s a closed, or *centralized*,
    ledger—it’s available only to your bank and you. The bank spends lots of money
    on massive data centers to store all its data.

    The Bitcoin ledger is not centralized like Bank of America’s. Instead, it is *decentralized*—distributed
    across millions of computers around the world. As a result, no company, government,
    or individual (including Satoshi) controls it.

    the network uses their computer to verify the data; the process takes about 10
    minutes. Once verified, the block of data is added as a new block on the blockchain.
    Once there, it is permanent and always available for all to see.

    done the work to verify my data.'

    On the next halving—in January 2024—the block reward will become 3.125 bitcoins.

    nomenclature—by solving the complex computations, the Bitcoin blockchain cryptographically

  prefs: []

    strength—i.e., your computing power. The more computers you have and the faster

    gear guzzles electricity (more on that later in this chapter). PoS avoids that
    problem (and the criticism that goes with it).'
  prefs: []

    buy only one, your odds of winning are 1 in 5,000\. But if you buy a thousand
    tickets, your odds of winning are one in five. So, the more coins you have in
    a PoS blockchain—the more you have at *stake*, get it?—the more likely you’ll
    win the block reward. The PoS protocol therefore encourages people to buy coins;
    theoretically, the price rises as more and more coins are bought.

    your transaction is verified.)

    fluctuates—a lot. Bitcoin’s average daily price movement is 3%, or three times
    more than the stock market. Volatility is bad for a currency, so someone created
    Tether, the first *stablecoin*, a digital asset whose price is meant to equal
    that of the US dollar or some other fiat currency. (More on stablecoins in chapter
    8.)

    faster than Bitcoin, but still much slower than Visa.^([I](#footnote-056))

    to exchange your dollars for chips, and the casino records the transaction. But
    once you’re at the poker table, you and other players swap chips freely and often—and
    the casino pays no attention to these *off-chain* (meaning, between parties) transactions.

    Lots of reasons. Because the cards are digital, they can feature video as well
    as photos. They aren’t restricted to the small three-by-four-inch size of physical
    trading cards—allowing them to offer far more content, including hyperlinks to
    other sites. They can’t be lost, damaged, or stolen. And ownership of NFTs can
    come with rights and benefits to buyers that physical cards may not have—such
    as first rights to other products, including game tickets, or special access to
    the athletes. And because the cards trade exclusively on a blockchain, traders
    know exactly who prior owners were because the complete history is viewable. This
    publicly available provenance can boost a card’s value (just as a house can be
    worth more if it was once owned by a celebrity).

    they’re using—the tried-and-true, well-established metrics applied to a variety
    of traditional asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, and real estate)—don’t work
    when evaluating digital assets. That’s because digital assets lack the inputs

    the costs incurred to build, replace, or procure it. That figure was fairly easy

    price at seven one-hundredths of a penny.

    a computer to mine bitcoin and pay for the electricity to power it, then compared
    that cost to the amount of bitcoin you got from mining. That seems to make more
    sense, and it works when you’re trying to figure out the proper price of Coca-Cola.
    But bitcoin isn’t a product, and you’re not trying to ascertain the price of the
    coin. What you want to identify is the cost of the entire network, and this “cost
    of mining” approach ignores the value of the Bitcoin ecosystem and its network.
    That’s a pretty big omission, which is why it leads to a wildly errant (and low)
    valuation.

    companies; they have no employees, headquarters, products, or sales.

    a given industry and uses their *multiples* as the basis for setting a price for
    the company being valued. For example, say a hotel company has $10 billion in
    profits, and it is sold for $50 billion. That’s a 5x multiple. So, if your hotel
    has $3 billion in profits, you should be willing to sell it for about $15 billion,
    using the same multiple.
