- en: Blockchain can be described as an immutable ledger, logging data entries in
    a decentralized manner. It has been argued that this emerging technology disrupts
    a wide variety of data-driven domains, including the health domain. In terms of
    data integrity, immutability, audit, data provenance, flexible access, confidence,
    privacy, and security, today's healthcare data management systems face critical
    challenges. A significant proportion of current healthcare networks leveraged
    for data management are often clustered, raising possible risks of single point
    collapse in the event of natural disasters. Blockchain is a decentralized, evolving,
    and revolutionary platform that has the ability to radically revolutionize, reshape
    and change the way of data accessibility in the healthcare sector. This chapter
    explores how the use of blockchain for data processing systems and accessibility
    in healthcare will stimulate advances and deliver substantial changes. This chapter
    presents a case study to show the practicality of blockchain technology for various
    healthcare applications.

    in technologies, because of which there have been significant improvements in
    e-health/medical records (EHR/EMR), insurance information, and prescription drug
    data [[35](#CR35), [75](#CR75)]. The sophisticated medical devices can be used
    to gather critical patient data, offer information on disease symptoms and trends,
    create automation in workflows, assist in remote caring and put patients in greater
    control of their treatments and their lives [[2](#CR2), [8](#CR8), [9](#CR9),
    [91](#CR91)]. It is possible to monitor patients in real-time using advanced medical
    devices. In addition, they decrease the need to pay visits to hospitals for routine
    health check-ups. Connected home health monitoring systems are now available that
    help in decreasing hospital stays of patients and their readmission expenses.
    Diagnosis is facilitated by the medical devices embedded with sophisticated technologies
    by means of alerts and trigger notifications before the disease reaches a serious
    stage [[7](#CR7), [15](#CR15), [50](#CR50), [108](#CR108)]. Data can be collected
    through the sensors incorporated in the different parts of a patient’s medical
    apparatus, which is then sent to the hospital where it is analyzed by a health
    professional for potential irregularities.

    in the healthcare sector [[6](#CR6), [48](#CR48)]. However, it has become very
    difficult to safely manage EHR/EMR because the data is transferred to different
    medical facilities [[81](#CR81)]. There is centralization of the majority of the
    healthcare systems, which are at risk of single point of failures and information
    breaches because of the increase of cybersecurity attacks [[80](#CR80)]. There
    are serious repercussions of the leakage of patients’ personal and vital information.
    In addition, the existing medical systems do not offer transparency, immutability,
    audit, trustworthy traceability, privacy, and security while handling EHR/EMR
    [[99](#CR99)]. Taking into account these issues in the existing healthcare systems,
    blockchain technology is a latest development that can be used to solve these
    issues [[22](#CR22), [30](#CR30), [34](#CR34), [60](#CR60)]. Blockchain adoption
    can give rise to annual savings of approximately $100–$150 billion by 2025 in
    expenses linked to data breaches and by bringing about a decrease in frauds and
    fake products [[103](#CR103)].

    [25](#CR25), [28](#CR28), [47](#CR47), [66](#CR66), [87](#CR87)]. There are various
    key built-in features offered by the blockchain technology, for example, transparency,
    authentication, decentralized storage, data access flexibility, security, and
    interconnection, and this is why the technology is used extensively for healthcare
    data management [[39](#CR39), [96](#CR96)].

    and conditions that are accepted by all the healthcare partners that are part
    of the network; thus, eliminating the need for an intermediary [[7](#CR7), [38](#CR38),
    [105](#CR105)]. This decreases unnecessary administrative expenses. There are
    essentially three concepts on which blockchain is based, which are peer-to-peer
    networks, consensus methods, and public key cryptography [[79](#CR79)]. There
    are three categories of blockchain, depending on their permissions: public, private,
    and consortium blockchains [[9](#CR9)]. Any person connected to the Internet can
    take part in the consensus process in the public blockchains. Incentives and encrypted
    digit verification are included in the public blockchains through proof-of-work
    or proof-of-stake methods. The public blockchain system is fully transparent,
    where the identity of every participating individual stays pseudo-anonymous. Only
    a single organization can control the network in a private blockchain, which is
    why a trustworthy agent is required in this kind of blockchain to obtain consensus.
    The benefits of both public and private blockchain networks are integrated in
    the consortium blockchain. This kind of network is only appropriate for those
    organizations that seek to achieve efficient communication between each other.
    Depending on the specific requirements or use case scenarios, any kind of blockchain
    network can be used by healthcare organizations because of the benefits and drawbacks
    inherent in each of them.'

    to record and share information in a community [[8](#CR8)]. Each entry is transparent
    and searchable, thereby enabling community members to view its history. The cryptology
    in blockchain substitutes third-party intermediaries as trust keepers, while all
    participants run complex algorithms to certify the integrity of an entry. This
    technology can provide a new model for HIE by attempting to decentralize EHRs,
    thereby improving system efficiency and security [[86](#CR86)]. Although blockchain
    technology is not a panacea, this technology has been led to a rapidly evolving
    field in the industry. Blockchain is important because it brings trust to P2P
    networks. The key component of blockchain technology includes consensus mechanism,
    distributed ledger and public key cryptography [[33](#CR33)]. These components
    communicate and coordinate over a distributed network of devices owned and maintained
    by multiple entities.

    members achieve the required application purpose. A system state perceived in
    one machine is replicated through the execution of consensus mechanism logic and
    P2P networking protocol to all other devices in the network [[33](#CR33)]. The
    replicated state information is stored in the context of blockchain, which is
    referred to as distributed ledger and is uniformly managed by the members of the
    network. Thereafter, the public key is used with a hash function to create a public
    address that users use to send and receive valuable assets [[3](#CR3)]. The private
    key, which is used to sign a digital transaction to ensure that the transaction’s
    origin is valid, is maintained confidential [[3](#CR3)]. Each block in the blockchain
    consists of at least one transaction, signature of the block validators, and reference
    to the previous block along with block headers. Blockchain provides opportunities
    for the standard architecture integration to radically transform our method of
    addressing various disciplinary systems issues, such as the Internet of Things
    (IoT) [[67](#CR67), [76](#CR76)], supply chain management [[32](#CR32)] and Industry
    4.0 [[31](#CR31)]. This advantage is due to the decentralized nature of blockchain
    technology, in which many users own an entire database of a particular system.
    These decentralized database systems based on blockchain can reduce one of the
    cheating sources of database manipulation. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies
    have received significant industrial and academic attention [[106](#CR106)]. Notable
    factors and opportunities will revolutionize the healthcare sector through its
    integration with blockchain technology [[72](#CR72)].

    healthcare industry. These features are intrinsic to the healthcare systems, and
    they can be applied to a broad of systems and industries. The features to be discussed
    specifically in this section are Decentralization, Transparency, Immutability,
    Traceability, Trustless, Persistency, Anonymity, Auditability, security, Authentication,

- en: Decentralization represents a very predominant feature of blockchain technology
    [[7](#CR7)]. Due to this inherited feature, blockchain enables the sharing of
    database directly in a distributed ledger without intermediaries, where transactions
    are processed and stored by the network nodes [[46](#CR46)]. As a transaction
    in the blockchain network can be conducted between any two peers without the need
    for central agency authentication, trust concern and server cost will be reduced
    through the usage of various consensus procedures [[63](#CR63)]. Moreover, the
    decentralization nature of blockchain architecture exhibits decentralized storage
    and data management, which can be the basis for the enhanced security and authentication
    of the information stored within healthcare systems [[60](#CR60)]. Decentralized
    storage and data management is achieved by spreading the storage from one major
    server into multiple servers through blockchain’s ledger [[16](#CR16)]. This will
    offer faster access to medical data and improve their quality as well [[60](#CR60)].
    Blockchain technology can be utilized as well by Mobile healthcare applications’
    developers to offer a secure and private sharing of patient data in a decentralized
    manner [[84](#CR84)].

    healthcare system, where patients need to put their confidence in this system
    [[63](#CR63)]. Blockchain technology through its decentralization nature brings
    trust to P2P networks by offering such components as a consensus mechanism, distributed
    ledger, and key cryptography [[43](#CR43), [46](#CR46)]. These components will
    eliminate the need for a trusted third-party intermediary and reduce the risk
    of failure.

    parties that do not trust each other. Although, the distribution of ledger across
    multiple nodes in blockchain network and the update of this ledger through consensus
    protocols will ensure the validity of transactions in an untrusted environment
    [[46](#CR46)]. The utilization of consensus protocol as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and
    Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) helps the network participants to communicate
    with each other to reach into an agreement by assuming that all honest nodes will
    have the same exact copy of the ledger [[46](#CR46)]. This node clustering approach
    where each cluster can have a trusted manager that maintains the ledger can have
    a significant impact on providing a secure network for healthcare transactions
    [[21](#CR21), [46](#CR46)].

    exchange can be obtained to replace the traditional centralized healthcare system,
    which improves the system efficiency and information security level [[43](#CR43)].
    In fact, blockchain could provide a trustworthy infrastructure, which allows data
    creators and consumers to authenticate and preserve their data [[49](#CR49)].
    For instance, if the blockchain consists of several blocks, then the last one
    will contain a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Moreover, the information
    of the current block will be used to create a new block. Therefore, this chain
    of connectivity among the participated blocks will detect and eliminate any false
    manipulation of the transaction information and assure the digital form of verification
    and ledger approval [[46](#CR46), [49](#CR49)].
  id: totrans-22

- en: Transparency is another significant feature that can be offered by blockchain
    technology toward healthcare applications industry. Data replication is a mechanism
    in such distributed system that allows decentralized nodes to access a shared
    replicated data ledger [[46](#CR46)]. In this mechanism, the transaction data
    in the blockchain network is replicated in the nodes and recoded as a chain where
    all the transactions linked together to go all the way to the first transaction.
    Accordingly, high transparent and secure transactions will be observed as any
    transaction changes that might occur on the network will be publicly visible [[46](#CR46)].
    Due to the transparency nature, blockchain technology has the capability to establish
    a secure and robust transparent framework for storing medical records. This framework
    offers quality services for the patients, and it reduces the treatment cost as
    well [[43](#CR43)]. Moreover, healthcare applications can utilize the transparency
    and the tamper proof features of blockchains to handle public transaction logs,
    which include timestamp information and can be publicly disclosed and checked
    by all the participants in the blockchain network [[43](#CR43)]. Therefore, through
    blockchain transparent and open nature, a trusted atmosphere, and a general acceptance
    about the usage of distributed healthcare applications by the healthcare providers
    will be achieved [[4](#CR4)].

    [43](#CR43), [46](#CR46)]. In fact, the distributed and transparent nature of
    blockchain technology makes it easier to audit and trace back complex transactions
    to its origin [[46](#CR46)]. Any transaction that might occur in a blockchain
    network is recorded and validated by a digital distributed ledger and timestamp.
    Auditing and tracing previous records are possible by accessing any node in the
    network [[63](#CR63)]. Appropriately, blockchain technology can be utilized in
    healthcare and pharmaceutical industries to trace drugs and patient data to overcome
    such a big problem as drug counterfeiting that can put a patient’s life in danger
    [[63](#CR63)].
  id: totrans-25

- en: According to research by [[17](#CR17)], auditability refers to all transactions
    in a blockchain that are maintained in chronological sequence, including the previous
    block’s hash and storage of the hash, which is intended to connect the next block
    when it is added. Transactions can be readily confirmed and monitored using this
    technique. In addition [[63](#CR63)], define auditability as the transactions
    that take place in a blockchain network and are recorded in a digital distributed
    ledger and authenticated by a digital timestamp. As a consequence, every node
    in the network may be accessed to audit and track past data [[98](#CR98)]. In
    Bitcoin, for example, all transactions can be tracked iteratively, facilitating
    auditability and transparency of the blockchain's data state. However, if money
    is flowing through many accounts, it becomes extremely difficult to track it back
    to its source. In sum, blockchain technology will lead to ensure that the overall
    credibility of healthcare applications. Also, it refers to maintain a log of all
    the transactions [[88](#CR88)].

- en: Immutability is the blockchain feature that makes the modification of transaction
    records once stored in a particular block in the chain is impossible [[7](#CR7),
    [46](#CR46), [63](#CR63)]. The data replication mechanism and distributed storage
    method allow a transaction to be stored in blocks through the entire blockchain
    network. This creates several redundant sources to verify the authenticity of
    the original transactions as each block in the chain is linked to the previous
    one using a cryptographic hash function. By having this redundancy, any attempt
    to modify a recorded transaction in a particular block will affect the subsequent
    blocks in the chain. Subsequently, a malicious actor requires to computationally
    change all the previous blocks in the chain to modify a transaction at a particular
    block, which is considered astronomically difficult considering the amount of
    work that needs to be done. Therefore, immutability, assurance, and security are
    obtained where any manipulation or forgery of data will be detected by the network
    [[43](#CR43), [46](#CR46), [63](#CR63)]. In fact, blockchain provides the infrastructure
    by which truth can be measured and it enables participants to prove their information
    are authentic and unchangeable. As a result, blockchain is recognized as an immutable
    distributed ledger [[63](#CR63)].

    to sensitive personal data due to the facility of allowing users to do transactions
    with generated addresses instead of using a real identity [[63](#CR63)]. Due to
    the decentralization and trustless environment of blockchain, no central authority
    is monitoring and recording users’ private information. The interaction with the
    blockchain network is based on random address generation, and hence, the user
    can have many addresses within a blockchain network to avoid the reveal of his
    identity. This feature and through the immutable ledger technology could provide
    a significant impact on obtaining confidentiality and integrity of patient records
    while integrating and sharing them among different healthcare facilities [[63](#CR63)].
    However, some recent studies on the Bitcoin platform have indicated that the history
    of a transaction can be linked to reveal a participant’s true identity [[85](#CR85)].
    This information leakage vulnerability is observed because all the public keys
    details are visible to everyone in the network, and hence, privacy prerequisites
    should be identified at the initial stage of blockchain applications [[63](#CR63)].

    facing several unique requirements that need to be handled by information technology
    and medical communities to assure quality services for the beneficiaries [[60](#CR60)].
    These requirements are associated with security, privacy, interoperability, data
    sharing, and mobility data access [[60](#CR60)]. Due to dissemination need of
    patient’s medical data and the existence of centralized data storage, traditional
    healthcare applications and data management approaches fails to provide a proper
    solution to handle these requirements [[60](#CR60)]. Accordingly, the adaptation
    of such technology as blockchain, which provides decentralization transactions
    processes with secure and trustworthy information access and sharing paradigm,
    into healthcare application industry has become a necessity. This necessity is
    outlined toward the advancement of digital healthcare industry by overcoming the
    limitation of the traditional healthcare applications [[46](#CR46), [60](#CR60)].
    Issues existed in the traditional client-server healthcare architecture as patients’
    records vulnerability, real-time patient data access, lack of drugs traceability,
    healthcare data fragmentation, access control, patient data privacy, and healthcare
    applications security can be solved by the integration of blockchain technology

    to provide quality services, disease diagnoses, and advance care for patients
    [[46](#CR46), [60](#CR60)]. Current medical data management are based on client-server
    architecture where hospitals are the primary keepers of the data [[46](#CR46)].
    Centralized data management creates a challenge for patients to have a unified
    view of their medical history since patient data could be stored at different
    hospitals and clinics. It also creates a challenge for healthcare experts to make
    precise disease diagnoses due to the lack of having a comprehensive informant
    about the patients’ medical history. Thus, blockchain can support the advancement
    of healthcare applications such that decentralized data management can be the
    backbone of this advancement [[4](#CR4)]. Patients and health professionals can
    have controlled access to the same medical records without giving anyone the rule
    of central authority over the global health data [[4](#CR4), [49](#CR49)]. Moreover,
    this decentralization will also motivate health service providers toward medical
    records standardization that will offer easy collaboration and follow-up between
    health’s professionals and service providers [[49](#CR49)]. As result, an overall
    improvement of healthcare services would be obtained.

    and services. These records are often very sensitive and usually are a main target
    for cyberattacks. Therefore, such records should be kept secure and private [[51](#CR51)].
    Due to the decentralization and immutability features of blockchain, no single
    data point can be hacked to steal immutable patient records [[51](#CR51), [63](#CR63)].
    Thus, once the medical records are stored at blocks network, no one can corrupt,
    change, or retrieve these records [[4](#CR4), [53](#CR53), [63](#CR63)]. All the
    medical data on the blockchain are encrypted, timestamped, and tamper proof [[4](#CR4),
    [53](#CR53)]. Furthermore, some cryptographic schemes and algorithms, such as
    attribute-based encryption, and identity-based encryption and signature, are utilized
    within blockchain architecture to strengthen the protection of patients’ identity
    and records [[4](#CR4), [89](#CR89)]. Therefore, blockchain technology is capable
    of establishing a robust and secure framework for protecting patient’s medical
    history and identity. Consequently, patients and healthcare service providers
    will have higher confidence in using such blockchain-based healthcare data management
    systems, which eventually lead to an increase in the level of medical data sharing
    and hence improve the overall healthcare services [[51](#CR51)].

    features can support patients and healthcare professionals to overcome the drug
    counterfeiting problem [[39](#CR39), [51](#CR51), [63](#CR63)]. Blockchain-based
    pharmaceutical supply chain application will be able to trace the pharmaceutical
    row materials offers by suppliers to the finished products recommended to the
    patients in an immutable and shared distributed ledger [[51](#CR51), [63](#CR63)].
    In addition, blockchain can be a solution to handle the annual loss for pharmaceutical
    organizations that occurs due to the drug counterfeiting problem [[63](#CR63)].
    This solution is achieved since all the transactions added to the distributed
    ledger are immutable and digitally timestamped and that makes it possible to trace
    a product and make its records tamper proof. Moreover, by integrating blockchain-based
    pharmaceutical supply chain applications with IoT anti-counterfeit devices, any
    counterfeit drug in the supply chain network will be detected throughout participants’
    data verification [[51](#CR51)]. According to this technological integration,
    a new open standard technology that migrates the pharmaceutical supply chain application

    sensors, low-power body-area wireless networks, and pervasive smartphones to remotely
    monitor the status of the patient outside traditional healthcare environment [[4](#CR4),

    incorporating blockchain technology into mHelath applications can resolve such
    shortcomings and improve security and quality of machinery [[22](#CR22), [60](#CR60)].
    Several m-Health applications have been developed based on blockchain incorporation.
    For example, a smartphone application for cognitive behavioral therapy was developed
    by a group of researchers [[44](#CR44)]. This application provided a secure and
    tamper-resistance network, where patients can monitor their own care by recording
    and remotely sending their medical data to the healthcare providers. Healthcare
    Data Gateway (HGD) is another smartphone application that has been developed for
    organization of patient data [[99](#CR99)]. Moreover, remote healthcare systems,
    such as the ones presents in [[35](#CR35), [71](#CR71)], were proposed on the

    technology with healthcare data management approaches will enable the efficient
    storage and sharing of medical data while ensuring data integrity and patient
    privacy [[52](#CR52)]. Accordingly, several researchers were focusing on developing
    blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems to facilitate patient-centric
    data storage and data sharing among varied healthcare providers [[4](#CR4), [43](#CR43),

    monitoring and tracking, and proper detection of counterfeit drugs to ensure optimal
    usage of drugs supplies [[18](#CR18), [51](#CR51), [52](#CR52)]. One of the growing
    concerns for this healthcare field is that the delivery of counterfeit or substandard
    medications [[51](#CR51), [52](#CR52)]. Counterfeit medications could consist
    of incorrect dosage of active ingredients and/ or inactive ingredients that may
    cause harmful allergic reactions to the patients [[51](#CR51)]. To address this

    tracing mechanism across industries. Blockchain technology has been identified
    as a perfect fitted tracing solution, where drugs related information is obtained
    in a safe and tamper proof open system that allows multiple healthcare parties
    to access this information [[51](#CR51), [52](#CR52)]. Accordingly, many blockchain-based
    medical supply chain applications, such as MediLedger [[52](#CR52)], Counterfiet
    Medicine project [[14](#CR14)] and Ambrosus [[52](#CR52)], have been proposed

    technology through its decentralization, immutability, and auditability features
    offers an optimized mechanism of direct and transparent links between patients

    and their children’s records. By logging into the Patient Portal (ID-card/m-ID),
    they can review their past doctor visits, current prescriptions, receive general
    health advice, etc. Blockchain technology is also used in the Estonian national
    health information system to ensure data integrity [[62](#CR62)].

    technology is used for electronic identity (ID card, mobile ID, and digital ID).
    To ensure the transparency and public accountability of the system in e-Health,
    the patient can control the access to the data by allowing or restricting access
    to it and also see everyone who has access to the data. Every update to healthcare
    records and every access to healthcare records is registered in the blockchain.

    strategies because of inter-individual differences [[19](#CR19), [37](#CR37),
    [70](#CR70), [94](#CR94)]. Therefore, medical records should be completely accessible
    so that personalized care can be provided to patients [[26](#CR26), [29](#CR29),
    [61](#CR61)]. The issue that arises with sharing medical records among the medical
    community is that most of the existing medical systems do not ensure security,
    privacy and trust [[90](#CR90)]. In addition, patients are not able to claim complete
    ownership of their medical records as it is possible to alter or delete information
    from medical records. In case patients shift to another facility, the tests done
    earlier need to be repeated, because of which there is an increase in costs. These
    issues can be resolved through blockchain technology [[13](#CR13), [58](#CR58),
    [94](#CR94), [104](#CR104)]. Data is stored on a decentralized peer-to-peer network
    that can only be accessed through smart contracts. It is possible to transfer
    this data from one hospital to another without the risk of misuse. It can then
    be used by doctors to acquire information about the patient’s history, which helps
    them understand their case better and offer them appropriate treatment. Blockchain
    also prevents further costs as patients do not have to repeat diagnostic tests
    that were carried out previously [[30](#CR30)]. All copies of patient records
    are stored on different nodes that are part of the blockchain network, which ensures
    that they remain accurate and transparent [[68](#CR68)].

    emergencies. If there are inconsistent permissions, a patient’s data access can
    face hurdles in a medical emergency, which puts the patient’s life in danger [[45](#CR45)].
    Two solutions can be offered by blockchain technology with respect to seamless
    and secure permission management. There are predetermined rules in blockchain-based
    smart contracts that have been approved by all individuals that are part of the
    contract, which help in offering access. It is possible to customize these contracts
    so that the workflows can be automated [[56](#CR56), [57](#CR57)]. Patients can
    use cryptographic keys to regulate access control. Healthcare data can be unlocked
    by the master key that is available to every patient. Patients can also share
    a copy of their data with medical practitioners or hospitals whenever required.
    Smart contracts can also be used to add read and write access rights. Blockchain-based
    smart contracts and cryptographic keys help in decreasing the errors that occur
    because of human negligence. In addition, collection time for patient data can
    be decreased through blockchain.

- en: Though telehealth systems are capable of getting past geographical constraints
    in healthcare, they are at risk of experiencing cybersecurity attacks. When the
    virtual connection that is formed between a doctor and patient is affected, the
    sensitive information regarding the patient gets compromised, for example, routine
    data transmissions, household activities, internal brand information, etc. [[97](#CR97)].
    Telehealth systems’ effectiveness is essentially dependent on the way the security
    and privacy issues are managed. Blockchain plays an important role in offering
    security, trust, and privacy in telehealth systems [[39](#CR39), [74](#CR74)].
    It facilitates the development of seamless data exchange in the absence of an
    intermediary that enhances customer confidence in the telehealth systems. Doctors
    can use it to store extensive history of patient, laboratory outcomes, and records
    of treatment/procedures in a decentralized, accessible, immutable, and traceable
    manner [[39](#CR39)]. The integration of blockchain technology into telehealthcare
    systems faces obstacles in that it may increase the cost for patients living in
    remote areas where there is a scarcity of resources.

    due to which the issue of presenting incorrect clinical trial data can be handled
    [[66](#CR66)]. It increases transparency and helps in enhancing the precision
    of data analytics that are carried out on the data obtained from the clinical
    trials. The use of blockchain for clinical trials research helps mitigate various
    issues like tracing and auditing of the clinical supply chain, patient recruitment,
    decreasing the overall time taken for carrying out trials, and reinstating the
    integrity of trial data. Blockchain can be used in precision medicine to handle
    the genomic sequences that help in proactively managing all types of diseases
    and illnesses that occur due to a genetic disorder [[83](#CR83)]. It was found
    that 10% of the chronic diseases experienced by the adult population are genetically
    inherited. To treat these diseases proactively, an understanding of the individuals’
    DNA profiles is required, and for this, genomic sequencing is needed. However,
    it involves difficulties like interoperability of DNA data and the readiness of
    organizations to share this data with others that prevent this from occurring.
    Individuals are able to own and manage their data through blockchain-based DNA
    data storage. This removes the need to have centralized databases that are handled
    by third parties, which are at high risk of being hacked. Since there is secure
    storage of an individual’s data on blockchain networks, they are able to share
    it with others for medical research, drug development, and public health research.

    and technologies for the storage and processing of their data [[39](#CR39)]. The
    life cycle of a health insurance policy typically involves various third parties
    or middlemen. In addition, there is sharing of information between different stakeholders
    of the insurance industry, because of which the entire process becomes time consuming
    and lengthy [[20](#CR20)]. There are clear inefficiencies in the existing medical
    insurance system. An exceptional degree of transparency is offered by blockchain
    technology as it keeps a record of all transactions carried out in a decentralized,
    traceable, secure, immutable manner that cannot be tampered with. Blockchain is
    capable of providing a solution for the interoperability problem. Smart contracts
    make it possible to obtain transactions, agreement records, and other information
    in an automated manner, which can bring improvements in the administrative processes.
    In addition, smart contracts also help in identifying fraudulent or exaggerated
    insurance claims. Another advantage of blockchain technology is increased transparency
    as it makes it possible for physicians to view the health coverage of patients
    [[74](#CR74)]. It also simplifies the health insurance process and enhances the
    precision of provider directory through consensus protocols. Therefore, blockchain
    is a very significant mechanism for the health insurance industries.

    kinds of frauds in the past [[97](#CR97)]. In addition, it takes significantly
    more time and resources to obtain billing information from the existing billing
    process [[35](#CR35), [61](#CR61), [107](#CR107)]. Billing inaccuracies occur
    unintentionally because of the complex coding that is part of the medical billing
    system, such as inaccurate filings or duplicate processes. The medical billing
    systems can be optimized by integrating computer-assisted coding techniques with
    blockchain systems [[39](#CR39)]. Blockchain is an emerging technology that has
    simplified the payment process and made it more secure in comparison to conventional
    billing methods, which most of the time makes significant delays in claiming the
    bills. The traditional payment systems caused even higher delays in bill payments
    of insurance claims. Such restrictions can be removed by blockchain which stores
    data in an immutable way. This allows insurance providers to make payments of
    insurance claims in a more rapid manner while reducing the need for additional
    time and resources.
