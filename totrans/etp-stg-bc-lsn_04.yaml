    and private stablecoins and their influence on payment systems. I examine the
    government response to digital currencies in the form of CBDCs and the ensuing
    competition with private stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. I also look at the
    policy implications of digital currencies, and regulatory concerns, before turning
    to the impact of digital currency on the global financial system, monetary policy,
    enterprises, and consumers in both the B2B and B2C context. Because of their reliance
    on blockchains, we can interpret the ubiquity, importance, and growing number
    of use cases of digital currencies as an indication of blockchain’s increasingly
    essential role in the financial sector. As digital currencies continue to gain
    in popularity and usage, blockchain will enter the mainstream.

    turmoil that brought the world’s financial system to the edge of collapse in 2008\.
    Part of the fallout of “the Great Recession” was strong mistrust in financial
    institutions and governments. Libertarians in particular sought a financial system
    beyond the control of governmental authorities. The idea was to create a currency
    independent of any nation-state that could be held and transferred without banks
    as intermediaries, thereby allowing individuals and firms to transact directly
    with one another. The result was Bitcoin.

    to accept an item as payment in exchange for goods or services that have value.
    Payments, be it shells, blocks of salt, bars of gold, or banknotes, are necessary
    to finalize an economic transaction. Money has several functions: to serve as
    a unit of account, a store of value, and a means of exchange. But it needs to
    be stable to be used to measure the value of a good or service. People are willing
    to accept money because its stability means it retains its value, in turn allowing
    it to become a means of exchange. Money and payments have evolved significantly
    over time. Money, in the form of coins and paper currency backed by a government,
    was a significant innovation in the means of payment (China in the eleventh century,
    late 1600s in England to finance King William’s war with France) and radically
    transformed commerce.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en104)'

    by banks through loans and fractional banking), credit and debit cards, mobile
    wallets, and cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) have transformed the economic landscape.
    In a relatively short time, customers have become accustomed to a wide variety
    of digital payment forms, such as paying with their smartphones, using contactless
    cards, and signing up for buy now, pay later plans at the point of sale. China’s
    experience with AliPay (Ant Financial/Ali Baba) and WeChat Pay (Tencent) suggests
    that consumers and merchants are eager to use digital forms of payment in their
    online transactions. In China, nearly 80 percent of smartphone users used proximity
    (NFC) mobile payments in 2019, with AliPay and WeChat Pay together accounting
    for 95 percent of the volume.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en105) All these apps, however,
    still link back to fiat money sources such as bank deposits and verified credit
    limits. The move to encourage the use of blockchain-based digital currencies as
    a means of payment has broad implications, further explored in this chapter.

    notably Ether, used in the Ethereum blockchain network with links to smart contracts
    (“programmable money”), and XRP in the Ripple network. However, it has had difficulty
    gaining widespread use as a payment system due to its significant volatility and
    transaction costs. This makes it difficult and costly to use as a unit of account
    and a means of exchange. Most Bitcoin is held as an investment vehicle rather
    than used in day-to-day transactions. Bitcoin total market capitalization approximated
    $1.15 trillion on October 24, 2021, with 18.85 million Bitcoin in circulation
    (90 percent of the maximum Bitcoin issuable), with one Bitcoin priced at $61,000,
    and then declining dramatically, in January 2022, to around $35,000, reducing
    market capitalization to about $750 billion. In comparison, daily transactions
    in forex trading in US$ approximated $6.6 trillion per day in April 2019.[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en106)

    high profile transactions. For example, Tesla announced in late 2020 that it would
    accept Bitcoin payments[4](14085-0014.xhtml#en107) (a decision reversed by May
    2021, with reasons adduced being high volatility and energy wastefulness inherent
    in Bitcoin mining), and in another example, an auction of digital art that sold
    for around $69 million was paid for with Ether.[5](14085-0014.xhtml#en108) However,
    these are exceptions, and bitcoin use remains relatively scarce in routine commercial
    purchases. Nonetheless, whether or not bitcoin fits the traditional characteristics
    of money, it has continued to grow—as a store of value and as a vehicle for speculation
    and investment. Major payment systems such as Square have started accepting bitcoin
    as an option in addition to more traditional means of payment such as credit and
    debit cards. What is needed is a way to combine the digital ease of handling bitcoin
    with the stability of major fiat currencies such as the US dollar.

    during 2019 and 2021, led to the rise of stablecoins. Stablecoins are linked to
    a stable asset such as the US dollar and are backed by significant collateral,
    such as DAI, which is pegged at a 1:1 ratio to the US dollar (DAI is issued by
    MakerDAO, which uses DAO as part of its name to indicate its use of decentralized
    governance). Other stablecoin are backed by reserves of equivalent amounts of
    fiat currencies, e.g., USDT (Tether) and USDC (US Dollar Coin), which hold US
    dollar reserves in amounts matching the number of USDT and USDC minted. Demand
    for stablecoins has been significant enough that major banks such as JPMorgan
    responded with its own digital currency, JPM Coin,[6](14085-0014.xhtml#en109)
    which has a value equal to one US dollar. JPM Coin can be used for transfer and
    payment between institutions within the JPMorgan Quorum blockchain, allowing for
    instantaneous settlement and transfer of value.

    that this is coming fast and could come in a way that is quite widespread and

    to provide the benefits of using digital currencies while reducing their volatility,
    by holding currency reserves (i.e., US dollars). Stablecoin value can also be
    maintained using algorithmic processes to adjust supply in relation to demand.
    By removing the concern over volatility, a stablecoin becomes more viable as a
    means of payment, particularly when designed to enhance ease of use for consumers.
    Stablecoins can offer low-cost, convenient, and instantaneous settlement. As stablecoin
    providers compete with other stablecoin operators for customers, they attempt
    to gain competitive advantage by providing pleasing user interfaces, superior
    app design, better integration with e-commerce transactions, and cost advantages

    and whether the reserves are holding their value. Stablecoins, such as Tether,
    have varied in value, though they are expected to hold US dollar reserves equivalent
    to the amount of Tether created. Tether accidentally created Tether coins to more

    MKR tokens are issued and enable MKR token owners to participate in governance,
    that is, setting reserve requirements and making changes to the Maker DAI protocol
    (and its underlying algorithm). As the use of a particular stablecoin becomes
    increasingly widespread, it can exert greater influence over commerce and money
    supply, and flawed governance can increase the risks from such influence. Since
    stablecoins seek to maintain one-to-one stability with a chosen fiat currency,
    changes in reserves must be accompanied by a concomitant increase or decrease
    in the number of stablecoins in circulation. Independent custody of such reserves
    backing stablecoin is essential to guarantee that reserves are segregated and
    adequate and are not used for funding operations.

    demand and supply of the stablecoin are continuously matched in the marketplace;
    otherwise, stablecoin volatility ensues. This could involve the stablecoin operator
    obtaining listings of the stablecoin on multiple digital currency exchanges and
    maintaining an internal inventory of stablecoin to deploy in purchase or sale
    operations to maintain stablecoin price stability. Moreover, stablecoin holders
    (clients) need to use their private keys to access their stablecoin holdings,
    and stablecoin operators can offer to store their clients’ stablecoin holdings
    or interact with private digital wallets where each owner holds and controls their
    private key. While the former centralized holding of clients’ holdings is akin
    to bank account operations, it increases vulnerability to hackers. However, enabling
    individual client control of their private keys and storage of holding in private
    wallets requires clients to be educated to safeguard their private keys and access
    control to their wallets since losing the private key would prevent them from
    accessing their holdings.

    In 2020, for example, the sudden need for increased liquidity and a boost of confidence

    significant intervention by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and
    other central banks. Although panic was contained, a question did arise: how might
    stablecoins function in the face of such catastrophes? Depending on the scale
    and rapidity of stablecoin adoption, they do have the potential to affect financial
    system stability. Stablecoin operators therefore must address consumer trust,

    reserves.'

    requiring stablecoin operators to issue a total volume of stablecoins less than
    client funds on deposit plus the issuing entity’s equity capital would help cement
    that trust. Interestingly, if funds migrate to stablecoin providers from banks,
    thereby reducing bank deposits, this could affect total funding available at banks
    to make loans, as the fractional banking model relies on leveraging customer funds
    on deposit. The rise of stablecoins could therefore reduce the money supply.

    and enforce overseas entity compliance with local regulations. Hence, to the extent
    that a global stablecoin is decentralized and global, stablecoin regulations transcending
    borders would require a mutually agreed upon cross-border cooperative regulatory
    regime. Nations would have to agree on the specific provisions and then cooperate

    fast payment system, TIPS (Target Instant Payment Settlement). Neither of these

    could offer similar instant payment settlement, significantly increasing liquidity
    while decreasing the amount of working capital allocated by enterprises. Access
    to the RTGS system is restricted to a few large banks, and such banks must maintain
    deposits to cover risks of default during the settlement process, thus increasing

    only or both wholesale and retail CBDCs. If wholesale only, the central bank could
    restrict CBDCs to banks and selected financial institutions. In this arrangement,
    central banks could authorize narrow banks (those that only take deposits and
    do not make loans) to offer and facilitate CBDC transfers to their retail clients.
    The Federal Reserve recommended such as intermediated approach, noting that US
    legislation does not authorize direct Federal Reserve accounts for individuals
    and would significantly expand the Federal Reserve’s role in the US economy.[30](14085-0014.xhtml#en133)
    There is political opposition to such an expanded Federal Reserve; for example,
    Congressman Tom Emmer introduced a bill to preempt the Federal Reserve from issuing
    CBDC directly to individuals.[31](14085-0014.xhtml#en134) In this wholesale case,
    the national CBDC controls the payment infrastructure while commercial banks and
    financial entities provide customer-facing services. Thus, a broader range of
    institutions can manage and distribute government-backed CBDCs. Such an approach
    can preserve contestability and prevent the rise of oligopolies. If CBDCs were
    marketed directly to the public, the government would be the sole source of stablecoin
    for the financial system. In a retail CBDC scenario, CBDCs would be available
    through individual digital wallets. In the case of the United States, users might
    need to maintain individual accounts with the Federal Reserve, which would require
    the Federal Reserve to manage and operate millions of individual accounts, a customer

    settlement system for those engaged in the subjective and risky process of bank
    lending.”[35](14085-0014.xhtml#en138) Regulations underlying sCBDC could require
    open standards and interoperability across different stablecoins (with central
    bank reserves transferred from one stablecoin account to another) as opposed to
    requiring consumers to seek cryptocurrency exchanges to exchange one digital currency
    for another. An sCBDC backed by a sovereign nation, by full faith and credit of

- en: Monetary Policy Transmission One concern is that digital currency (especially
    private stablecoins) could prejudice governmental control over money supply and
    its ability to conduct monetary policy. If governments implement CBDCs and choose
    to offer interest on CBDC accounts, varying this interest rate would make it easier
    to transmit monetary policy.[46](14085-0014.xhtml#en149) This is because CBDCs
    would be a substitute for money market instruments, and banks would need to match
    CBDC interest rates to prevent customers from switching out of their bank deposits
    for CBDCs. Interest-bearing CBDCs would make negative interest rates possible
    (assuming that the option to switch into cash to avoid negative interest for CBDC
    account holders is circumscribed). That is, cash would be replaced with digital
    currencies, in particular, CBDCs, and as digital currencies are programmable and
    can have conditions attached to them, CBDC issuers wishing to use negative rates
    could attach a smart contract to a CBDC deposit, charging a fee to hold the deposit
    and returning an amount smaller than the initially deposited principal, effectively
    charging a negative interest rate. Furthermore, any CBDC impact on reducing reserves
    in the system could be offset with open market operations to inject liquidity,
    leading the Bank of International Settlements to suggest that the “presence of
    CBDC would have limited impact on monetary policy implementation.”[47](14085-0014.xhtml#en150)

    deposits to CBDCs and to private stablecoins. Customers might move their bank
    deposits to a CBDC account or tokens to have access to digital currency to use
    in their online transactions. They may prefer the relative greater safety of a
    CBDC account, particularly if it is interest bearing. If this disintermediation
    occurs, enterprises will have a harder time borrowing from banks whose supply
    of loanable funds from bank deposits would be reduced. Banks might have to offer
    higher interest rates to retain deposits, driving up lending rates. There would
    be a differential impact on smaller borrowers, who are more reliant on bank lending
    and are generally unable to float bonds. Consequently, borrowers might seek new
    relationships with digital money providers with access to loanable funds. They
    may resort to borrowing from the shadow banking sector and P2P borrowing channels
    through stablecoin providers. However, such digital currency entities may charge
    higher rates as it may be costlier for them to assess credit and price risk. Overall,
    there may be fewer sources for small businesses to borrow from, driving up borrowing
    costs.

    monetary policy, as interest rates may diverge from the desired target rates,

    “it is difficult to draw definitive or quantitatively-robust conclusions about
    the impact of CBDCs on the monetary transmission mechanism” as it would depend
    on the design of the particular CBDC in question, the economic environment into
    which it is introduced, and the structural changes that might follow, such as

    While improving individual welfare, this transition could negate the ability of

    weak currency to a stronger one. Thus, stablecoins could reduce monetary sovereignty
    and increase currency substitution in countries with weak currencies, high inflation,
    poor governance, endemic corruption, and limited enforcement of rule of law. In
    times of stress, significant volumes of domestic currency that has been converted
    into global stablecoins could lead to significant capital outflows, negatively
