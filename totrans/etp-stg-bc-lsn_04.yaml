    and private stablecoins and their influence on payment systems. I examine the
    government response to digital currencies in the form of CBDCs and the ensuing
    competition with private stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. I also look at the
    policy implications of digital currencies, and regulatory concerns, before turning
    to the impact of digital currency on the global financial system, monetary policy,
    enterprises, and consumers in both the B2B and B2C context. Because of their reliance
    on blockchains, we can interpret the ubiquity, importance, and growing number
    of use cases of digital currencies as an indication of blockchain’s increasingly
    essential role in the financial sector. As digital currencies continue to gain
    in popularity and usage, blockchain will enter the mainstream.

    turmoil that brought the world’s financial system to the edge of collapse in 2008\.
    Part of the fallout of “the Great Recession” was strong mistrust in financial
    institutions and governments. Libertarians in particular sought a financial system
    beyond the control of governmental authorities. The idea was to create a currency
    independent of any nation-state that could be held and transferred without banks
    as intermediaries, thereby allowing individuals and firms to transact directly
    with one another. The result was Bitcoin.

    to accept an item as payment in exchange for goods or services that have value.
    Payments, be it shells, blocks of salt, bars of gold, or banknotes, are necessary
    to finalize an economic transaction. Money has several functions: to serve as
    a unit of account, a store of value, and a means of exchange. But it needs to
    be stable to be used to measure the value of a good or service. People are willing
    to accept money because its stability means it retains its value, in turn allowing
    it to become a means of exchange. Money and payments have evolved significantly
    over time. Money, in the form of coins and paper currency backed by a government,
    was a significant innovation in the means of payment (China in the eleventh century,
    late 1600s in England to finance King William’s war with France) and radically
    transformed commerce.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en104)'

- en: In the past millennium, new forms of payments such as bank money (money created
    by banks through loans and fractional banking), credit and debit cards, mobile
    wallets, and cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) have transformed the economic landscape.
    In a relatively short time, customers have become accustomed to a wide variety
    of digital payment forms, such as paying with their smartphones, using contactless
    cards, and signing up for buy now, pay later plans at the point of sale. China’s
    experience with AliPay (Ant Financial/Ali Baba) and WeChat Pay (Tencent) suggests
    that consumers and merchants are eager to use digital forms of payment in their
    online transactions. In China, nearly 80 percent of smartphone users used proximity
    (NFC) mobile payments in 2019, with AliPay and WeChat Pay together accounting
    for 95 percent of the volume.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en105) All these apps, however,
    still link back to fiat money sources such as bank deposits and verified credit
    limits. The move to encourage the use of blockchain-based digital currencies as
    a means of payment has broad implications, further explored in this chapter.

    notably Ether, used in the Ethereum blockchain network with links to smart contracts
    (“programmable money”), and XRP in the Ripple network. However, it has had difficulty
    gaining widespread use as a payment system due to its significant volatility and
    transaction costs. This makes it difficult and costly to use as a unit of account
    and a means of exchange. Most Bitcoin is held as an investment vehicle rather
    than used in day-to-day transactions. Bitcoin total market capitalization approximated
    $1.15 trillion on October 24, 2021, with 18.85 million Bitcoin in circulation
    (90 percent of the maximum Bitcoin issuable), with one Bitcoin priced at $61,000,
    and then declining dramatically, in January 2022, to around $35,000, reducing
    market capitalization to about $750 billion. In comparison, daily transactions
    in forex trading in US$ approximated $6.6 trillion per day in April 2019.[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en106)

    2021, with reasons adduced being high volatility and energy wastefulness inherent

    for around $69 million was paid for with Ether.[5](14085-0014.xhtml#en108) However,
    these are exceptions, and bitcoin use remains relatively scarce in routine commercial
    purchases. Nonetheless, whether or not bitcoin fits the traditional characteristics
    of money, it has continued to grow—as a store of value and as a vehicle for speculation
    and investment. Major payment systems such as Square have started accepting bitcoin
    as an option in addition to more traditional means of payment such as credit and
    debit cards. What is needed is a way to combine the digital ease of handling bitcoin

    stablecoins of their own. JPM Coin, created in 2019, is one such pilot project.
    Maintaining a stable value equal to $1, it is intended to facilitate transfers
    between JPM institutional clients. Client funds in specified accounts are converted
    into JPM Coins, which are transferred to the named recipient and are then converted
    instantly to US dollars. JPM Coin can help in settling bonds and commodities transactions
    since instantaneous settlement can permit instant delivery. JPM notes that the
    technology is “currency agnostic” and could be used to transfer other currencies.
    It is also intended to be compliant with existing regulations while “reducing
    clients’ counterparty and settlement risk, decreasing capital requirements and
    enabling instant value transfer.”[14](14085-0014.xhtml#en117) The collateral for
    JPM Coins is the US dollar, held by JPMorgan in a 1:1 ratio. The underlying assumption
    is that JPMorgan can adequately hold US dollar reserves, backing its JPM Coin
    unencumbered. And because JPMorgan is regulated as a systemically important financial
    institution, JPM Coin can command high trust.

    Simultaneous, almost-instantaneous sale, and settlement of equities and financial
    instruments would also be possible, making back-office clearing and settlement
    unnecessary. Another useful feature of CBDCs (as well as stablecoins and cryptocurrencies
    linked to smart contracts in a blockchain) is the ability to have money perform
    specific functions, for example, deduct and send variable percentages of sales
    tax directly to a treasury on a given purchase.[28](14085-0014.xhtml#en131) Such
    features would need to accommodate privacy protection, with the Digital Monetary

  zh: 从消费者视角看，主要发达国家的政府作为CBDC（中央银行数字货币）的发起方，可能被视为比追求利润的私营实体更值得信赖，在管理一个国家的货币和货币供应方面能降低系统风险。与来自追求利润私营实体的私人稳定币相比，使用CBDC几乎无成本，因为客户可以避免中介费用。CBDC的使用通过引入股票和债券的代币化，降低了资产交易所的成本并提高了效率。同时，股票和金融工具的几乎同时出售和结算也将成为可能，使得后台清算和结算变得
    unnecessary。CBDCs（以及与区块链中智能合约链接的稳定币和加密货币）的另一项有用特性是，能够让货币执行特定功能，例如，在特定购买中扣除并发送销售税的不同百分比直接到国库。[28](14085-0014.xhtml#en131)
    这些特性需要适应隐私保护，数字货币研究所（DMI）建议采用“设计隐私”来获得政治和立法支持以及消费者接受。DMI还强调离线工作的能力，处理点对点转账。[29](14085-0014.xhtml#en132)
- en: In creating CBDCs, governments can choose between creating wholesale markets
    only or both wholesale and retail CBDCs. If wholesale only, the central bank could
    restrict CBDCs to banks and selected financial institutions. In this arrangement,
    central banks could authorize narrow banks (those that only take deposits and
    do not make loans) to offer and facilitate CBDC transfers to their retail clients.
    The Federal Reserve recommended such as intermediated approach, noting that US
    legislation does not authorize direct Federal Reserve accounts for individuals
    and would significantly expand the Federal Reserve’s role in the US economy.[30](14085-0014.xhtml#en133)
    There is political opposition to such an expanded Federal Reserve; for example,
    Congressman Tom Emmer introduced a bill to preempt the Federal Reserve from issuing
    CBDC directly to individuals.[31](14085-0014.xhtml#en134) In this wholesale case,
    the national CBDC controls the payment infrastructure while commercial banks and
    financial entities provide customer-facing services. Thus, a broader range of
    institutions can manage and distribute government-backed CBDCs. Such an approach
    can preserve contestability and prevent the rise of oligopolies. If CBDCs were
    marketed directly to the public, the government would be the sole source of stablecoin
    for the financial system. In a retail CBDC scenario, CBDCs would be available
    through individual digital wallets. In the case of the United States, users might
    need to maintain individual accounts with the Federal Reserve, which would require
    the Federal Reserve to manage and operate millions of individual accounts, a customer
    service task that may overtax its capabilities.[32](14085-0014.xhtml#en135)

  zh: 在创建CBDCs时，政府可以选择只创建批发市场，或者同时创建批发和零售CBDCs。如果只创建批发市场，中央银行可以将CBDCs限制给银行和选定的金融机构。在这种安排下，中央银行可以授权狭义银行（那些只接受存款而不放贷的银行）向其零售客户提供并促进CBDC转账。美联储建议采取这种间接方法，指出美国法律没有授权个人直接拥有美联储账户，并且会显著扩大美联储在美国经济中的角色。[30](14085-0014.xhtml#en133)
    对于这样一个扩大后的美联储存在政治反对意见，例如，国会议员汤姆·埃默尔引入了一项法案，以阻止美联储直接向个人发行CBDC。[31](14085-0014.xhtml#en134)
    在这种批发情况下，国家级CBDC控制支付基础设施，而商业银行和金融机构提供面向客户的服务。因此，更广泛范围的机构可以管理和分发政府支持的CBDCs。这种方法可以保持竞争性，防止寡头的崛起。如果CBDCs直接面向公众营销，政府将成为金融系统中稳定币的唯一来源。在零售CBDC情景中，CBDCs将通过个人数字钱包提供。就美国而言，用户可能需要与美联储保持个人账户，这将要求美联储管理和运营数百万个个人账户，这是一个可能超出其能力的客户服务任务。[32](14085-0014.xhtml#en135)

    payments, making them faster and cheaper. As in the domestic market, the CBDC
    issuer would need a complementary network of local entities to convert and facilitate
    local currency redemption. To thrive, the cross-border aspects of CBDC design
    would need to focus on functionality, reducing risk, and providing advantage over
    private decentralized cryptocurrencies. However, CBDCs could have a negative impact
    on commercial banks. If individuals are allowed to have accounts with central
    banks, they might reduce funds on deposit with commercial banks, lowering the
    bank’s ability to make loans to small business, affecting their growth. Commercial
    banks might have to lower fees and offer better interest rates for depositors

    sCBDC是一种公私合作伙伴关系，其中稳定币提供者得到中央银行储备的支持并可以访问这些储备。他们需要满足预先确定的股权水平，并作为没有贷款功能的窄银行运作，从而符合现有的银行监管框架。sCBDC将使中央银行储备可供数字货币提供者使用，而所有其他功能都将由这些数字货币提供者执行。政府还可以像目前监管银行一样监管私人稳定币发行者，以保护消费者和公众利益（例如执行AML、KYC、CFT）并维持对货币政策的主导权。
- en: Synthetic CBDCs would not increase or decrease the total amount of CBDC in circulation,
    thus avoiding the risks of new forms of private money creation while allowing
    the separation of the payments platform on which CBDC functions from the reserve
    settlement system used in support of bank lending. Synthetic CBDCs address the
    “design (of) a central bank–issued monetary instrument that can flow across different
    payments platforms, while preserving the independence and integrity of the reserve
    settlement system for those engaged in the subjective and risky process of bank
    lending.”[35](14085-0014.xhtml#en138) Regulations underlying sCBDC could require
    open standards and interoperability across different stablecoins (with central
    bank reserves transferred from one stablecoin account to another) as opposed to
    requiring consumers to seek cryptocurrency exchanges to exchange one digital currency
    for another. An sCBDC backed by a sovereign nation, by full faith and credit of
    the state, would also be seen as less risky because access to central bank reserves
    would reduce liquidity and market and default risk. Further, paying interest on
    sCBDC reserves could also extend monetary policy to such digital currencies.

    背后的sCBDC规定可能要求在不同稳定币之间实现开放标准和互操作性（中央银行储备从一个稳定币账户转移到另一个）而不是要求消费者寻求加密货币交易所来交换一种数字货币换取另一种。由主权国家支持的sCBDC，凭借国家的全信和信用，也被视为风险较低，因为访问中央银行储备会降低流动性和市场以及违约风险。此外，对sCBDC储备支付利息也可能将货币政策扩展到这类数字货币。

    agreed upon store of value and an anonymous means of payment, with no further
    exchange of information necessary to complete a transaction. Money created by
    banks, such as checks (based on bank deposits and thus a claim on a store of value)
    and loans issued by banks to firms (through fractional banking, with loan volume
    based on deposits, bank equity, and their access to federal reserves in the overnight
    markets, aka, their ability to borrow) are traditional means of payment. Bank
    money claims depend on verified ownership of and sufficiency of funds backing
    the claim. Transfers satisfying the claim that affect bank balances are recorded
    by the relevant parties (to prevent double-spend). Verifying claims also slows
    down payment, which is one of several ways in which newer stablecoins and blockchain-based
    cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have an edge over cash and bank monies.

- en: Monetary Policy Transmission One concern is that digital currency (especially
    private stablecoins) could prejudice governmental control over money supply and
    its ability to conduct monetary policy. If governments implement CBDCs and choose
    to offer interest on CBDC accounts, varying this interest rate would make it easier
    to transmit monetary policy.[46](14085-0014.xhtml#en149) This is because CBDCs
    would be a substitute for money market instruments, and banks would need to match
    CBDC interest rates to prevent customers from switching out of their bank deposits
    for CBDCs. Interest-bearing CBDCs would make negative interest rates possible
    (assuming that the option to switch into cash to avoid negative interest for CBDC
    account holders is circumscribed). That is, cash would be replaced with digital
    currencies, in particular, CBDCs, and as digital currencies are programmable and
    can have conditions attached to them, CBDC issuers wishing to use negative rates
    could attach a smart contract to a CBDC deposit, charging a fee to hold the deposit
    and returning an amount smaller than the initially deposited principal, effectively
    charging a negative interest rate. Furthermore, any CBDC impact on reducing reserves
    in the system could be offset with open market operations to inject liquidity,
    leading the Bank of International Settlements to suggest that the “presence of
    CBDC would have limited impact on monetary policy implementation.”[47](14085-0014.xhtml#en150)

    CBDC account, particularly if it is interest bearing. If this disintermediation

    of loanable funds from bank deposits would be reduced. Banks might have to offer
    higher interest rates to retain deposits, driving up lending rates. There would
    be a differential impact on smaller borrowers, who are more reliant on bank lending
    and are generally unable to float bonds. Consequently, borrowers might seek new
    relationships with digital money providers with access to loanable funds. They
    may resort to borrowing from the shadow banking sector and P2P borrowing channels
    through stablecoin providers. However, such digital currency entities may charge
    higher rates as it may be costlier for them to assess credit and price risk. Overall,

    in blockchain technologies, has significant potential to change the payments world.
    These changes will affect the macroeconomy and the structure of the financial
    industry and will impact enterprises and individuals. Enterprises would benefit
    from understanding the implications of digital currencies for their operations
    and proactively taking steps to manage this transition. They must decide how to
    accommodate growing customer demands for digital payments operations, consider
    the consequences of adopting digital currency payment systems, and participate
    in the emerging digital currency ecosystem to maintain their competitive position
    relative to their customers and suppliers. I next consider, in chapter 4, the
    proliferating applications of digital currencies, and the challenge they pose
    to financial incumbents, in the emerging world of blockchain-based decentralized
    finance: DeFi. DeFi start-ups present a significant disruptive challenge to traditional
    financial services incumbents as its initiatives range across a variety of segments,
    from deposit and savings accounts to collateralized loans, financial derivatives,
    insurance services, and raising capital through bonds and equity offerings.'
