    and an AI Strategy are essential to be considered. To start with multiple dimensional
    concepts, we have to be focused on AI framework, such as processes to be implemented
    based on the requirements, the enhancing of the capabilities, the platform to
    incorporate our desired requisites, the tools to work on the chosen platform,
    the organizational structure, and the stakeholders or par-takers involved. A cup
    holder of all these ingredients forms the framework of AI. The appropriate selection
    of the best option under these most quantified dimensions provides the framework
    of AI. All these dimensions move forward with the decisions made, almost in all
    terms. For example, data storage of the application being developed can be facilitated
    by in-campus or cloud storage. If in the case of a cloud provider, which one to
    be chosen either as a backup or a primary one, all these decisions are influenced
    by the vital factors like the cost-effectiveness, time consumption possessing
    adequate skillset, and the enhancement of the capabilities. Moreover, the choice
    of the second provision must also be kept open in all implications. Further decisions
    are on the tools of usage such as the tool set provided by the cloud vendor or
    open-source tools, and AI team is either from the in-house humane crew or any
    external consulting front to augment the workforce. The possible processes can
    be implemented with the specific list of capabilities in an enhanced manner as
    approved by the organizational hierarchy personnel along with the interaction
    and grant of the partners involved in the production process to bank on them to
    make it a page on their end or leverage on the new partners on the cutting edge
    of the same zone. A simple narration of the various dimensions of AI is pictographically

    a model, to learn and get trained to run in a public cloud. It overlays with the
    usage of a sensor in real time or collects data in real time and learns about
    it. IoT was taking advantage of AI via big data and data lakes. With Predictive
    Maintenance, it gained more value. Instead of a rules engine to program statically,
    it has become dynamic. To train a model in a public cloud, run it at the edge
    and it will infer in the run time; when it detects that the predictions are not
    accurate, it goes back and uses the previous data lake’s data stream, gets trained
    again, and is deployed to the edge, and it automatically runs the cycle to curtail
    the drift between the actual values and the predicted values. This encapsulation
    of AI and IoT reflects as AIoT is entirely dynamic with the replacement of static
    rules engine embedded in IoT, reactive modeling with predictive (forecast) modeling,

    20 tasks contributing to these 4 evaluation zones unpredictably, based on fluency
