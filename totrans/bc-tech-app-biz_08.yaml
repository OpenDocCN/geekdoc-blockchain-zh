- en: Grant management is a vital process that enables organisations to successfully
    deliver programmes that address social, economic, environmental, and other challenges.
    Globally, grant transfers represent significant sums, and their management is
    fraught with deficiencies that undermine the impact of the donated funds. Among
    the most urgent challenges in grant management are to improve transparency and
    reduce high administration costs. Digital transformation has done much to enhance
    efficiency, transparency, and accountability in grant administration; however,
    numerous shortcomings still exist. Blockchain, smart contracts, and tokenisation
    can be combined to achieve greater levels of efficiency and control in grant management
    than is currently possible. Through the study of fundamental blockchain concepts,
    the authors propose a grant-management solution that tokenises every expenditure
    item and uses smart contracts to automate payments, reporting, and budgetary compliance.

    from a lack of basic social infrastructure (water, sanitation, electricity, healthcare
    access, etc.) to discrimination and hunger. These challenges severely jeopardise
    the futures of people in countless communities who are desperate to escape the
    cycles of hopelessness that these social ills create. Governments, multilateral
    organisations, foundations, and philanthropists attempt to address these issues
    by developing and funding programs to the tune of trillions of US dollars annually.

    misappropriation of funds and poor oversight of administration, prevent many people
    from benefiting from the assistance they desperately need. To address these deficiencies,
    a number of different grant management systems have been developed over time.
    These systems have sought to incorporate new tools to update their capabilities
    in accordance with the latest technological advances. Still, much inefficiency

- en: Since the release of Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper (2008), where the first
    cryptocurrency—bitcoin—was unveiled, blockchain, the underlying technology of
    bitcoin, has gained traction in applications beyond finance and payment systems.
    Blockchains, as the name suggests, consist of a chain of blocks that enable peer-to-peer
    transactions in an append-only distributed database, with tamper-proof, time-stamped
    transactions that are secured by cryptographically distributed trust and incentivised
    consensus (Cong & He, 2019, p. 8). Its novel feature set includes decentralisation,
    immutability, real-time traceability, auditability, security, and privacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decentralisation in blockchain technology refers to the distributed validation
    of transactions without reliance on a central authority. Distributed nodes validate
    transactions according to a consensus mechanism that combines cryptography with
    economic incentives (Narayanan et al., 2016). Decentralisation safeguards data
    contained on a blockchain against a single point of failure, a shortcoming of
    centralised systems (Kraft & Carmona, 2020).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Immutability refers to the unalterable nature of blockchain records. Each block
    is chronologically ordered and inextricably tied to each other using a hash pointer,
    which references all other blocks in the blockchain. Therefore, if a malicious
    actor wanted to modify transactions within a block, they would have to alter all
    preceding transactions back to the genesis (first) block of the blockchain (Kraft
    & Carmona, 2020). In this way, no record can be reasonably reversed, or modified,
    establishing the reliability and credibility of records. Although transactions
    cannot be reasonably altered, the manipulation of transactions is possible; however,
    it requires an inordinate amount of resources, which is economically and computationally
    prohibitive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchains further ensure sound, real-time, traceability with the use of a
    search-engine-like tool called a block explorer. Block explorers enable any individual
    to view all transactions that have taken place on a blockchain. Moreover, since
    transactions and blocks are immutable, transparent, and traceable, a blockchain
    ledger provides an inherent level of assurance towards fulfilling audit assertions—completeness,
    occurrence, accuracy, existence, valuation, and cut-off (Kraft & Carmona, 2020).

    features. One such blockchain is Ethereum, most widely utilised for decentralised
    applications (dApps). Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum introduced greater
    functionality with the development of smart contracts.

- en: Smart contracts are generally understood as machine-readable programmes, written
    in code, that self-execute when a set of predetermined conditions is met. New
    technical advances in blockchain have enabled truly autonomous smart contracts
    that are capable of self-execution and self-enforcement (Lausati et al., 2017).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no single smart contract protocol. Hewa et al. (2020) analysed smart
    contracts in the Ethereum, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, Stellar, and Waves blockchain
    environments. By comparing features such as privacy, security, interoperability,
    and transaction costs, Hewa et al. (2020) outlined advantages and disadvantages
    of different smart contract design environments. Further illustrated in Table
    1 are inescapable trade-offs that exist in smart contract design. For instance,
    in a permissioned blockchain such as Hyperledger, the ability to integrate various
    consensus mechanisms provide greater flexibility for users, whereas in public
    blockchains that do not support customized consensus mechanisms, there is reduced
    flexibility but a greater level of security (2021, p. 5). Since no blockchain
    can excel in all facets of smart contract design, each blockchain optimizes their
    smart contract design environment for the features required by the community of
    developers who utilize their platform.

    asset or function. For instance, casino chips represent money within a casino
    ecosystem, as they enable patrons to play games and can also be exchanged for
    money. Money itself is a token that symbolises legal tender backed by the state,
    and is recognised as able to extinguish a public or private debt. Digital tokenisation
    has its origins in data security within the payments industry, where sensitive
    credit-card data is converted to a random string that is non-sensitive, enhancing
    security of confidential user information and reducing security burdens on merchants.

    and non-physical assets, collectibles, identity, and other information (Antonopoulos

    the functionalities and characteristics of the blockchain protocol (Fisher et
    al., 2020) upon which it is created, such as immutability, traceability, decentralisation,
    and others. Tokens can also represent a set of instructions used to effect change
    on a blockchain through smart contracts. Many developers believe tokenisation
    to be the “killer-app” for blockchain mass adoption (Elliot, 2020).

    token issuers to enforce transfer restrictions on their tokens, determining to
    whom and under what conditions tokens may be assigned (TokenSoft, 2018). Token
    standards outline the minimum specifications and rules that govern functions and
    behaviours of a token. A token standard is not a fixed rule as developers are
    at liberty to add new features that were not part of the initial standard, increasing

- en: In monetary and financial economics, money is understood to have three primary
    purposes. It is a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account.
    As a unit of account, money can be thought of as data, particularly as money becomes
    increasingly digital. Westermeier (2020) notes that, as societies shift from using
    traditional financial infrastructure towards digital platforms, money is increasingly
    used as data, “By embedding money as a form of data deeply into the platform,
    money is levelled with other kinds of data” (Westermeier, 2020, p. 2054).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Money primarily exists as an entry on a ledger within the banking sector. This
    ledger is almost always external to the transactions or context in which the money
    is being transacted. For instance, an online purchase is a transaction between
    a seller and a buyer; however, the payment stage of the transaction requires engaging
    third parties (the issuing and merchant banks, the merchant acquirer, card network,
    etc.) to conclude the purchase. In part, these numerous intermediaries are a consequence
    of the “low-data” characteristic of money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally, money contains very little information. A digital transaction,
    on average, contains only four pieces of information, including the amount transacted,
    the payer, the payee, and the date transacted. Physical fiat money contains even
    less data (value only).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike cash or current digital payment systems, blockchain adds functionality
    to money (funds) by sophisticating and enhancing the data contained in money when
    it is tokenised. By tokenizing money, permission, condition, and restriction requirements
    can be embedded within money itself. The exchange of money will, therefore, no
    longer be separate to the set of contractual obligations and conditions of a transaction
    but will now be inextricably part of it. Related to grant management, blockchain
    tokenization can improve all processes of grant administration, since tokenisation
    merges a grant’s conditions and its funds.

- en: The granting process involves an organisation or a donor distributing funds
    to another organisation or recipient for the purpose of achieving predetermined
    objectives (Weiss, 1973). Grants from governments, multilateral organisations,
    global funds, private philanthropy, and international cooperation agencies amount
    to trillions of US dollars every year. According to the Organisation for Economic
    Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2021), in 2020, official development assistance
    (ODA) from OECD countries to developing and low-income countries accounted for
    US$ 161.2 billion. On average, 90% of ODA measured by the OECD is a subsidy (Keeley,
    2012, p. 49); that is, the recipient does not have to reimburse the amount. Grants,
    at a high level, follow a process that can be outlined in five major steps illustrated
    in Figure 1.

    infrastructure development, subsidise training, transfer cash to vulnerable populations,
    etc. Each grant project includes a series of activities that aim to achieve a
    specified purpose. Grant projects have either a sole executor or adopt a multi-tiered
    system with grantees and sub-grantees. Some grant funding is unconditional, while
    other grant funding is based on stringent conditions (e.g. subject to the delivery
    of research findings or other outcomes). Grants are thus multi-dimensional, and
    the complexity of their management is influenced by several factors, including
    the number of grantees and intermediaries, activities, and conditionalities, among
    others.

- en: Grant management starts once an applicant is awarded and signs a contract with
    the donor (step 4 in Figure 1). Grant contracts include items such as activities,
    expenditure budgets, intermediaries, milestones, and timeframes. Usually, donors
    require that grantees provide regular updates via reports, as to the progress
    of a grant project’s implementation (monitoring). These reports assist donors
    in determining whether a project is achieving its predetermined milestones in
    accordance with the project plan (administration). Key to this reporting is the
    financial assessment, which compares the budgeted forecast expenditure to amounts
    expended within a given period. This process requires reconciliation of progress
    reports with bank statements, payment vouchers, and contract conditions to ensure
    that amounts were spent in line with grant contract stipulations (step 5 in Figure
    1).

    management process (Figure 1); however, the authors will focus on the “implementation
    and administration” and “closeout” steps for which blockchain-based applications
    have already emerged. In this regard, IBM has developed a proof of concept for
    the use of blockchain to facilitate a more seamless process to apply for natural
    disaster relief funds, and make it easier for applicants to prove that they are
    truly victims (Delaney, 2020). In 2017, the Office of Financial Innovation and
    Transformation (FIT), in partnership with Deloitte and the National Science Foundation,
    developed a proof of concept to analyse how blockchain could improve grant-payment
    processes and increase transparency in multi-tiered grant-payment projects (Fisher
    et al., 2020, p. 26). The project also highlighted how grant recipients could
    use tokens to transfer and redeem grant payments (Bureau of the Fiscal Service,
    n. d.). A finalised application is not yet available, and research efforts continue.
    A similar application is Disberse, a fund-management platform on the blockchain
    that allows donors, governments, and other types of grantors, to transfer and
    trace funds from donors to intermediaries and from the latter to final beneficiaries.
    Disberse further facilitates cash transfers via mobile or vouchers for vulnerable
    populations (Marke, 2018).

    unique tokens for each expenditure line item. These tokens are programmed with
    the addresses of the approved, whitelisted recipients, preventing tokens from
    being transferred to unauthorised recipients. Drawing from the work of Dai and
    Vasarhelyi (2017), automated reporting is established (Figure 3), consisting of
    a set of smart contracts that extract, process, and generate data from transactions
    using the created tokens. In so doing, information at various levels of the grant
    process may be instantly aggregated to generate financial, managerial, and operational

- en: First, fungible tokens are created in an amount equal to the budgeted fiat money
    allocated to each category of expenditure (e.g. human resources, supplies, equipment,
    operation, finance—such as taxation, fees—etc.). Each token is backed by fiat
    currency in a traditional bank account. For example, suppose wages (W), supplies
    (S), and equipment (E) are expenditure items with a budgeted fiat value of US$
    1,000 each. These expenditure items will therefore each be assigned 1,000 tokens.
    Following the example, (W) tokens, (S) tokens, and (E) tokens will be created
    as payment tokens since they are used to settle debt obligations, in this case,
    with suppliers and employees; however, they also perform functions such as triggering
    smart contracts that automate reporting.

    comprehensive set of sophisticated smart contracts controls the flow of tokens
    from approved expenditure budget line items to whitelisted suppliers in accordance
    with the embedded code logic. Smart contracts execute only after all necessary
    supply-chain management conditions are met. This information is transmitted to
    the smart contracts by Oracles from approved data sources (e.g. IoT data). Once
    the tokens are transferred to whitelisted-supplier wallets, a second set of smart
    contracts—those responsible for the swap from tokens to fiat currency—is triggered.

    Management Act (MFMA) (which prohibited municipalities from transferring funds
    to mutual banks) by making deposits with the VBS mutual bank to the tune of billions
    of rands. Once the fraud was identified by the National Treasury of South Africa,
    R2 billion (approximately US$ 140 million) had already been embezzled by banking
    staff, the bank’s auditors, and senior government officials, leaving complicit

    mechanism and highlighted the need to revise the public sector granting system.
    The South African Local Government Association (SALGA, 2018) urged the National
    Treasury to develop the ability to obtain real-time data and other reports from
    municipalities towards better monitoring, advisory, and support. They further
    lobbied provincial treasuries to strengthen Council oversight structures, and
    most importantly, to revise monitoring instruments in Section 71 of MFMA.

    implemented, but are insufficient to ensure the efficient and transparent execution
    of grants. Beyond a robust legal framework, the sound execution of grants in local
    government is dependent on the enforcement of procedures and controls during day-to-day
    operations, such that fraud is prevented rather than regretted.

    reports to the National Treasury detailing how monies were being spent, they were
    clearly ineffective at adequately and timeously detecting the large-scale maladministration.
    In a National Parliament Committee debriefing to discuss the economic impact on
    municipal finances of the VBS fraud, it was noted that the “veracity of the information
    coming from municipalities had been challenging in terms of accuracy, timeliness,
    and completeness” (Mdakane, 2018).

    management inefficiencies. When a significant amount of time elapses between the
    occurrence of a transaction and the reporting thereof, reports are rendered ineffectual.
    In October 2016, two years before the allegations of fraud at the VBS emerged,
    the District Attorney raised concern as to the activities of municipalities with
    the National Treasury. A subsequent National Treasury warning to municipalities
    only went out in August 2017, almost a year later. This delay was caused by inefficiencies
    in obtaining supporting information. To issue a warning to a municipality, the
    National South African authorities had to gather, verify, aggregate, and reconcile
    information that was siloed in third-party ledgers such as bank statements and
    municipal financial systems. The Parliamentary Monitoring Group refers to this
    problem as follows: “If it (i.e., National Treasury) had that insight (i.e., to
    the municipal information in real-time), then probably its early warning and monitoring
    systems would have picked things up [...]” (Mdakane, 2018).'

    to validate municipal information. In the case study, the detection of fraud and
    financial inaccuracies appeared only after audits by SALGA and KPMG. The US Fiscal
    Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT), while studying the use
    of blockchain for the numerous US grant programs, noted that on average, each
    payment request from grantees takes two hours to be reconciled, grant managers
    spend 40% of their time on compliance, and almost US$ 20 billion are returned
    due to overpayments (Fisher et al., 2020).

    a solution would have allowed the National Treasury of South Africa to promptly

    implementation. To compensate for this shortfall, administrators source funds
    allocated to other line items or, perhaps more worryingly, supply inferior goods
    or services to compensate for the shortfall. For example, overspending on employee
    costs could reduce goods or services provided to beneficiaries or impact their
    quality, as well as cause delays in project completion.

    at the discretion of administrators. Over-expenditure is only detected at the
    reporting stage, after funds have been spent or when a grantee has already created
    an obligation with suppliers. By creating tokens equivalent to approved budgeted
    expenditure values, fiscal discipline is enforced. The opportunity to illegally
    cross-subsidize one expenditure item for another is eliminated since tokens can
    only be utilised for their intended purpose. Additionally, account whitelisting
    restricts the transfer of funds to recipients in excess of the budgeted amount
    set by grantors. Should additional funds be required, this may be facilitated
    by the reprogramming of smart contracts after the express approval of grantors.

    time frame. As such, when under-spending occurs the outcomes of grants (aid, relief,
    service delivery, etc.) remain unfulfilled. While there may be legitimate reasons
    for not fully spending funds within allotted timeframes, the process of recovering
    unspent funds from non-performing grantees is not without significant administrative
    effort.

    contracts, and tokenisation concepts while emphasising their characteristics and
    appeal. Blockchain technology as a whole is being used for the digital representation
    of assets and more abstract value representation, such as intellectual property
    rights, liabilities, facilitating contract underwriting, and value accrual, as
    is the case with shares or securities. Other better-known applications of blockchain
    include its use in supply-chain management, health care recording, and energy
    provision. The authors have envisioned the use of blockchain tokenisation in grant
    management since a great need exists for local and international grantors to ensure
    that their funds are utilised in accordance with agreements and towards achieving
    expected outcomes.
