    important questions you should be asking to help results-oriented AI opportunities
    in your organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • What business outcome do we want to achieve?  Let business needs and goals
    dictate sensible applications of AI. Always align your AI initiatives with your
    overall business strategies. It makes no sense to invest in an area that does
    not have a clear impact on business goals. If you ignore this, you will never
    make it to production and be stuck in proof-of-concept purgatory.

    inefficiencies. A mostly universal example would be to look for critical processes
    or tasks in your business that rely heavily (or entirely) on manual data entry.

    for AI or AI-augmented solutions lies in any process or area where your organization
    can improve its decision making. In particular, where would your organization
    benefit from moving to a more data-driven model?

- en: • Where do we have a lot of relevant data?  AI depends upon the information
    you feed it. While that could ultimately come from all manner of sources, the
    early phases of identifying promising AI opportunities will likely be better served
    by considering areas in which you have robust, reliable, and accessible data.

    during their AI exploration. It is common to identify business problems for which
    there is a relevant AI project, but where the project will not solve the problem.
    This is common in AI projects aimed at driving better business efficiency.

    phishing, crypto jacking, IoT attacks, malware, SQL injection, and a lot more
    are a huge concern for anyone in the online world. An option available to boost
    cyber-security is the Blockchain technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain uses a combination of public and private keys to store and send virtual
    assets. The public key creates the address of where the assets are stored in the
    public ledger. The private key is used to sign each transaction a user sends out
    and prove that the user requesting the transaction does in fact have ownership
    of the assets. Anyone can have access to the public key, but as long as the private
    key remains a secret, the assets are safe. But if a private key is lost or stolen,
    the assets associated with it are gone forever. Herein lies the fundamental shortfall
    that undermines the security of Blockchain solutions—protecting private keys.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is apparent that the security challenges, specifically the vulnerability
    of private keys, must be addressed before the full potential of Blockchain technology
    can be realized. Multisignature improves security by introducing additional distributed
    keys for recovery and authentication. Yet, this still relies on the use of original
    keys. To meet this critical market gap, multisignature can be combined with proven
    tokenization technology. Tokenization is a process that replaces sensitive credentials—such
    as private keys for Blockchain—with a nonsensitive equivalent token that is unique
    to each transaction. In doing so, tokenization mitigates fraud risk and protects
    the underlying value of credentials. This adds a layer of frictionless security
    that complements the immutability of the Blockchain.
  prefs: []

    trust and transparency is needed—starting with a new approach to security. Tokenization
    technology is an immediately available solution to provide this foundation.

    be used to go through the mountains of data generated by Internet users and then

    What this means is that if those who have access to those algorithms only know
    one or two things about you, they can “guess” other things about you with a high
    degree of accuracy. This really challenges the traditional notion of privacy invasion.
    Because you aren’t being directly observed. Your private life is laid bare even
    if you’ve never leaked anything private about yourself. The other major form of
    AI privacy invasion comes from deep learning applications. For example, deep learning
    neural networks can identify faces in seconds. So if you are moving in a public
    space, just a single clear frame caught by a camera somewhere can help piece together

    development process to automate test phases. By 2022, at least 40 percent of new
    projects will have codevelopers of AI in their team. The main reason for this
    trend is to be found in a market that is rapidly shifting from an approach in
    which scientific data professionals must collaborate with application developers
    to create the most optimized solutions for AI to a model in which the professional
    developer can operate alone using models of advanced data analysis and AI predefined,
    even used as a service.'

- en: Any discussion on privacy must be grounded in the broader topic of digital ethics
    and the trust of your customers, constituents and employees. While privacy and
    security are foundational components in building trust, trust is actually about
    more than just these components. Trust is the acceptance of the truth of a statement
    without evidence or investigation. Ultimately an organization’s position on privacy
    must be driven by its broader position on ethics and trust.
