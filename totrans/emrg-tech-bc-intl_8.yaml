- en: Blockchain uses a combination of public and private keys to store and send virtual
    assets. The public key creates the address of where the assets are stored in the
    public ledger. The private key is used to sign each transaction a user sends out
    and prove that the user requesting the transaction does in fact have ownership
    of the assets. Anyone can have access to the public key, but as long as the private
    key remains a secret, the assets are safe. But if a private key is lost or stolen,
    the assets associated with it are gone forever. Herein lies the fundamental shortfall
    that undermines the security of Blockchain solutions—protecting private keys.

- en: It is apparent that the security challenges, specifically the vulnerability
    of private keys, must be addressed before the full potential of Blockchain technology
    can be realized. Multisignature improves security by introducing additional distributed
    keys for recovery and authentication. Yet, this still relies on the use of original
    keys. To meet this critical market gap, multisignature can be combined with proven
    tokenization technology. Tokenization is a process that replaces sensitive credentials—such
    as private keys for Blockchain—with a nonsensitive equivalent token that is unique
    to each transaction. In doing so, tokenization mitigates fraud risk and protects
    the underlying value of credentials. This adds a layer of frictionless security
    that complements the immutability of the Blockchain.

    be used to go through the mountains of data generated by Internet users and then
    create algorithms that can deduce things about you from very little information.
    What this means is that if those who have access to those algorithms only know
    one or two things about you, they can “guess” other things about you with a high
    degree of accuracy. This really challenges the traditional notion of privacy invasion.
    Because you aren’t being directly observed. Your private life is laid bare even
    if you’ve never leaked anything private about yourself. The other major form of
    AI privacy invasion comes from deep learning applications. For example, deep learning
    neural networks can identify faces in seconds. So if you are moving in a public
    space, just a single clear frame caught by a camera somewhere can help piece together

    and network-connected. Smart cameras, self-driving cars, and home automation systems
    are primary examples. Being watched wherever you go, having every action you make
    be recorded, and then for that sum total of your digital being scrutinized by
    AI—that’s a future that’s almost upon us.

    privacy. The invention of tiny cameras and listening devices is one example. It’s
    technically trivial these days to hide cameras and microphones in someone’s private
    space and record everything that they do. The problem isn’t that technology can
    do something in principle, it’s that we allow or condone the use of technologies
    in particular ways. The state needs the permission of the judiciary to plant bugs
    in your home. We have checks and balances to mitigate technological privacy abuses.
    The biggest problem is that our laws are based on conceptions of privacy from
    what is essentially another world. Unfortunately, the wheels of legal reform turn
    very slowly.

    checks the details, and points out the main parts that need our attention and
    it’s called Guard. Guard is a neural network application that reads privacy policies.
    Currently, it has only been created to read the policies of well-known popular
    services such as Tinder, Netflix, and LinkedIn. You can request Guard to add other
    services and companies to its list, but that’s an on-going process. Guard not
    only reads the policies for you, but it breaks them down in an easy-to-read manner.
    For example, it shares information about past privacy scandals a company has gone
    through and the level and amount of threat you may be faced with if you agree
    to their terms and conditions.

    business, market, and business organizational models. What awaits us is a hyper-technological
    and connected world, an immense intelligent platform with autonomous things, and
    an increasingly natural mix between the physical world and digital worlds—a scenario
    that cannot ignore privacy and ethics. Some of the future trends are in autonomous
    and intelligent things as you can see in [Figure 7.8](#ch7fig8).

    exploits a specific area of AI, for example, machine learning, to transform not
    only the analysis process itself but also the way in which the resulting content
    from the analysis is consumed and shared. Gartner predicts that this type of analysis
    will produce information and data that will be incorporated directly into the
    company, in particular those related to customer services, finance, HR, and marketing,  to
    optimize and speed up the decision-making processes. This ability will automate
    some processes, and Gartner also predicts that  by 2020 over 40 percent of data
    science activities will be automated, resulting in increased productivity and
    wider use of data by all, not just “experts.”'

    will be exponentially based, on which there will be several AI systems such as
    robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, appliances, and intelligent agents. Gartner
    predicts that within a few years any type of service, application, and object
    based on the IoT will integrate some form of AI to automate human processes, decisions,
    and/or actions collaboratively human-to-machine and machine-to-machine. Pervasiveness
    is what will make the difference: it will no longer be just about having intelligent
    objects and systems in our world but seeing a swarm of intelligent things that
    work together. A possible scenario thanks to the Blockchain of Intelligent Things.'

    immutable and shared public record of transactions/actions, is still immature,
    little understood, and difficult to scale and expand globally. First of all, companies
    should start to become familiar with this technological architecture that promises
    radical changes in entire sectors, starting with finance. Banks and financial
    services  companies are beginning to consider using blockchain to simplify and
    optimize traditional banking operations  and to launch new cryptocurrencies that
    will be regulated or influenced by monetary policy. The blockchain also expands
    into other sectors where the cost of trade and contract closing times decreases
    and cash flow increases. Blockchain will create 3.1 trillion dollars in terms
    of corporate value by 2030.'

    connected sensors and terminations and potentially digital twins as copies of
    products and processes. Already today, digital twins are models able to support
    and accelerate business processes, have independent analytical skills, and are
    able to do real-time analysis. These systems will evolve over time, improving
    their ability to collect and visualize data, apply the right rules, and respond
    effectively to business objectives to the point that you will soon hear about
    DTO  (Digital Twin Organization), models that through data analysis will understand
    how an organization makes its business model operational, how it behaves on the
    market, how it distributes resources and responds to changes to provide value
    to the customer.'

    trend is to be found in a market that is rapidly shifting from an approach in
    which scientific data professionals must collaborate with application developers
    to create the most optimized solutions for AI to a model in which the professional
    developer can operate alone using models of advanced data analysis and AI predefined,

    and the trust of your customers, constituents and employees. While privacy and
    security are foundational components in building trust, trust is actually about
    more than just these components. Trust is the acceptance of the truth of a statement
    without evidence or investigation. Ultimately an organization’s position on privacy
    must be driven by its broader position on ethics and trust.
