    some common misconceptions around cryptocurrency.

- en: I frankly admit that I also almost got infected with scepticism towards cryptocurrency
    at the beginning of my journey, as many people scared me by telling me that cryptocurrency
    is a wildcat venture, financial pyramid, or the like. Such false beliefs often
    fence many people off from possible success. Only a small number of sticklers
    verify such statements about cryptocurrency instead of just blindly believing
    them.

- en: I am sure that you have also heard allegations that no country will ever recognize
    cryptocurrency so cryptocurrency has no future. To refute this, it is enough to
    recall the recent increase in the value of cryptocurrency. Some countries have
    already recognized cryptocurrency as means of payment. Thus, this so-called “entertainment
    for geeks” has evolved into very real business for investment bankers and various
    corporations.

    is most likely because of the large number of the aforementioned statements, which

    with the words right  now so that you better understand why you should do this
    right  now.

- en: First, right  now there is very little competition in the market. Are you surprised?
    It’s true. Yes, the interest in this topic constantly grows, but in general, the
    competition is still very low. This market is still quite "wild" and unmastered.
    The reason for this is that most people tend not to trust new trends and ventures,
    as we have already mentioned above.

    are at the stage of growth and development, but even so, you can earn a decent
    sum of money. As long as you manage your risks wisely, you can make profits in
    time.

- en: Third, right now there are a lot of freeloaders in the market. They come to
    the cryptocurrency market to make a quick buck without delving into the subject.
    Usually, such people come from the pyramid schemes led by so-called "experts"
    who teach people without having any real experience in the topic themselves. I
    must admit that the market encouraged such people in the beginning, when they
    had a chance to make lots of money then. However, nowadays, if you want to achieve
    something like this in the cryptocurrency market, you will have to make real efforts.

- en: Fourth, right now there are low risks in the market. Five years ago, most people
    waited for the day when cryptocurrency would be officially banned. These days,
    many countries around the world have already recognized the relevance of cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrency has gained such momentum that no one can simply press the stop
    button now. Do you really think that this fact does not prove you can invest your
    money without fear of various prohibitions and restrictions?

- en: Finally, before moving on to the rules of the game in the cryptocurrency market,
    I suggest considering the future of cryptocurrency through the example of the
    Tesla company. Currently, the cost of a Tesla is estimated in the amount that,
    according to the expert forecasts, it will not be able to make back its expense
    in 300 years. Why do smart experts rate Teslas so highly then? Let's puzzle it
    out.

- en: These days, an electric car is beautiful and stylish but expensive and not a
    very practical vehicle. However, experts are not concerned about today. They visualize
    a future that can become a reality in 20 or 30 years. It is difficult to imagine
    in years to come the ordinary cars we see daily in the streets now. You may imagine
    your old beloved car in the future, but personally, I picture some kind of semi-flying
    vehicles with solar panels or something even more sophisticated. Therefore, it
    is the electric vehicle that will have a bright and successful future, and Tesla
    is likely to occupy a leading position in the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out that, by and large, no one knows for certain whether Tesla will
    hold its position in the market for the next 20-30 years. However, many people
    strongly believe it will, and this belief makes them invest in the company. Therefore,
    personally, I can easily believe that Tesla will hold a monopoly in the entire
    automotive manufacturing sector in 20 years.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How is this example linked to the future of cryptocurrency? Nowadays, some people
    view cryptocurrency (like an electric vehicle) as meaningless – a fashionable,
    interesting and technically curious trend. But a trend, nonetheless. However,
    this tiny drop now is likely to grow into a large dominant sea in the future.

    any investment in the cryptocurrency market IS A RISK. If you are not ready to
    accept this, don’t bother trying. Any opinion or forecast for the development
    of a particular coin, the reliability of ICO (this will be discussed later) is
    only a biased stance. There is not a single person across the globe who could
    give you an iron-clad guarantee for further developments. There are absolutely
    no right decisions and 100% guarantees. I or someone else can only give you a

    about reliable cryptocurrencies with you. However, this will be just my subjective
    opinion, again, only at this very moment. Therefore, if you are up to the task
    of blaming others for your possible failures, not yourself, you’d better close

    dealing with cryptocurrency trading, one must learn to take personal responsibility
    for making decisions and always remember that no gains can be made without taking
    risks. Yes, there are less risky strategies, but risks exist in any case. Invest
    just the sum you are willing to lose without much regret.
