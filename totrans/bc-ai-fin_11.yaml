    marketplace, and the disruption that these tools bring are felt throughout the
    market and by different actors it will also be important for practitioners and
    organization to obtain the appropriate mindset. There is a phrase used in the
    accounting profession, but is one that can apply to different subsets and areas
    of the financial services profession as well; riches are in the niches (McCausland
    [2000](#CR6)). Generalized services, lower level tasks, and virtually every aspect
    of workplace activity that can be automated will be automated and this will invariably
    cause margin compression, fee restructuring, and the importance of generating
    differentiated services. This is already underway, and the tried and true solutions
    of investing in more automation while also reducing employee headcount will simply
    not be sufficient to compete effectively going forward. Organizations are large
    and sophisticated as BlackRock, Deloitte, and numerous other firms in other industries
    are currently dealing with these forces with a combination of investment, hiring
    of different employees, reduction of current headcount, and launching of digital
    solutions. That is well and good, as well as being absolutely necessary, but a
    different tactic will be required going forward.

    [2000](#CR6)）。通用化服务，低层任务，以及几乎可以自动化的工作活动的方方面面都将被自动化，这势必会导致边际收缩、费用重结构，以及生成差异化服务的重要性。这个过程已经开始，通过投资，招聘不同的员工，减少现有员工人数，以及推出数字解决方案，像黑石集团、德勤和其他行业中的许多其他公司一样，大型和复杂的组织目前正在应对这些力量。这是很好的，也是绝对必要的，但未来将需要采取不同的策略。
- en: Returning to the basics and avoiding spending too much time in the theoretical
    conversation, a prime example of how this transition is underway and eminently
    possible is the transition that has occurred as Morgan Stanley. Following the
    financial crisis there was a period of consolidation and low returns among the
    vast majority of financial institutions, including once high flying investment
    banks. Taking into account the changing market conditions and increased regulations
    coming to the business landscape itself, Morgan Stanley made a strong pivot and
    shift into the wealth management business. Riding the rising asset prices that
    began to catch investor attention following the 2009 lows, this approach and business
    line has benefitted the organization in terms of profits, market share growth,
    and the ability to attract new talent to the firm. Now, it is true that building
    out such a line of business does also increase the overall exposure of MS to market
    prices and volatility, which did rear its ugly head in first quarter of 2019,
    but that is a business risk. The point of this discussion is not to praise or
    criticize the specific shift or approach taken by MS, but to illustrate the fact
    that substantial transitions are indeed possible.

    business model, banks – including commercial and investment banks – are also increasingly
    investing in technology tools, solutions, and applications. Whether it takes the

    or a digitally based banking platform such as Marcum the trend is clear. If such
    venerable and well establishing institutions such as Goldman Sachs are developing
    and launching online products and services to appeal to new and different areas
    of the marketplace that should indicated just how important these transitions
    and shits can be for the marketplace. These examples are high profile for sure,
    but illustrate the impact that increased in automation and decentralization are
    already driving in the marketplace between different actors. Regardless of what
    is the specific focus of the organization or the product or service that is customized,
    the changing transitions is clear. Being a general practitioner is a career path
    and arc that has diminished in viability across medical, engineering, and other
    consulting fields; why should financial services do any different? Acknowledging
    that the financial services fields are not unique in terms of what is happening
    in the professional landscape also means that there are opportunities to learn

- en: Drilling down into different niche offerings that are already being developed
    and built up by firms using emerging technology tools it is entirely possible
    to see what directions may drive change and innovation going forward. For example,
    the accounting firm Withum Smith and Brown recently launched an entire digital
    advisory services arm focused exclusively on blockchain, cryptoassets, and offering
    assurance work connected to these tools. Even more exciting, however, are the
    possibilities and opportunities that arise when these various technology tools
    are able to be stacked and combined (Greenstein and Hunton [2003](#CR2)). Looking
    for an example, the following scenario is entirely possible and not as far removed
    from reality as may initially be thought. In a consortium or other type of private
    blockchain based environment an accounting firm, an audit engagement can be- for
    the most part – almost entirely automated and streamlined. Leveraging the tamper
    resistant structure of the blockchain itself means that a large percentage of
    confirmations and valuations no longer need to be handled manually or be staff
    members. In addition to the reduced manual work and tasks that are necessary by
    engagement team members this also means that likelihood of errors, double counts,
    and other inefficient uses of time can be reduced. The lower likelihood of errors
    and omissions associated with the work products themselves also allows the organization
    to leverage automation tools to assist with the audit process itself. Increasing
    the options and opportunities for increased review by artificial intelligence
    tools and automation based platforms means that more comprehensive audit results
    and reports are possible.

    [2003](#CR2)）。举个例子，以下情景是完全可能的，而且并不像最初所想象的那样脱离现实。在一个财团或其他类型的基于私有区块链的环境中，会计公司的审计工作可以在很大程度上几乎完全自动化和精简。利用区块链本身的防篡改结构意味着，很大一部分的确认和估值不再需要手动处理或由员工完成。除了减少审计团队成员所需的手动工作和任务外，这也意味着错误、重复计数和其他低效的时间使用的可能性可以减少。工作产品本身与错误和遗漏相关的较低可能性也使组织能够利用自动化工具协助审计过程本身。通过人工智能工具和基于自动化的平台对审计结果和报告进行更全面的审查，增加了选项和机会。
- en: Since the results and reports can be issued and developed this also means that
    different service lines and opportunities can be constructed around the opportunities
    enabled via increased technology integration. Other service lines can be built
    around the continuous attestation and reporting of information, including the
    ability of accountants and auditors to monitor in real time and produce forward
    looking dashboards and information. On top of being able to develop these service
    lines for clients this also means that the forward looking data and reports can
    be delivered at higher margins than historical looking data and information. Such
    a scenario represents the most clear cut example of how different aspects of emerging

- en: One of the core aspects of the financial services profession is that there has
    always virtually been an information asymmetry with regards to financial data,
    and this will only be amplified in a marketplace continuously infused with financial
    technology and applications (Ball [2017](#CR1)). Certified professionals, by the
    nature of their education and training, have long been a part of a so-called grand
    bargain that has existed in the marketplace. This so-called grand bargain, in
    terms of actual business applications and use cases, is defined by a few core
    characteristics. First, there are a limited number of individuals that can be
    employed within the professional classes that include attorneys, engineers, doctors,
    and financial professionals. This is due to not only the formal education in the
    form of college degrees, but also the continuing education and retraining that
    is often as part of the licensure process. Second, the limited number of individuals
    that can be a part of the professional class create a situation where being employed
    in one of these sectors – like financial services – can be quite lucrative. Margins
    have traditionally been healthy in the financial services sector, and regardless
    of individual opinions on the appropriateness of said margins, the fact remains
    that they exist.

    凭借其教育和培训的性质，认证专业人员长期以来一直是市场中存在的所谓“大交易”的一部分。 这种所谓的大交易在实际的商业应用和用例中，被定义为具有一些核心特征。
    首先，可以被雇佣在包括律师、工程师、医生和金融专业人员在内的专业人群中的人数有限。 这不仅是因为正规教育（例如学士学位），还包括通常作为执照过程的一部分的继续教育和再培训。
    其次，能够成为专业人士一部分的人数有限，导致了在这些领域（如金融服务）就业可能相当有利可图。 金融服务行业的利润率传统上一直很高，而且不论个人对这些利润率的适当性持何种意见，实际情况是它们确实存在。
- en: Entire organizations and legions of consultants have grown up around the core
    two pillars of providing financial services information to the marketplace. These
    pillars and core drivers of the profession include both the analysis of complicated
    financial information, and the reporting/communication of this information to
    both internal or external end user group, including the most recent integration
    of privacy into the data management and distribution conversation (Stecking and
    Schebesch [2015](#CR7)). Both of these core components of financial services are
    linked to the grand bargain between the market and professional employees. Linking
    back to the grand bargain indicated and introduced above, the analysis and interpretation
    of financial information may seem like a mystery to end users, and this is due
    directly to the lack of information symmetry in the marketplace. Information,
    after all, is what drives the business decision making process across different
    industry segments, including the financial services. That said, in order for decisions
    to made effectively, both parties – be they individuals or institutions – must
    have equal access to the data used to make the decisions that are impacting that
    organization. This may seem like a relatively straight forward statement of fact;

    making process would want to have access to the underlying information.

    it is merely another technology tool in a long line of technology tools and improvement
    projects. Obviously increasing efficiency and the speed with which data is processed,
    analyzed, and communicated to end users is a good thing, but that in and of itself
    is nothing new. Blockchain, especially private or consortium blockchains that
    are built, maintained, and utilized by a number of different organizations can
    generate a very distinctive business benefit. Traditional process improvement
    projects, initiatives, and efforts that are normally underway at organizations
    are focused on improving performance within the organization. Blockchain, in contrast,

    upon is that many of the pain points  in the business process occur when data
    must be transferred between organizations. This includes, but is not limited to,
    the development of new practice niches centered around emerging technology and
    technology areas (Kahan [2001](#CR3)). Establishing a common platform to share
    and distribute information between network members is already underway via EDI
    and other data management platforms, but the core components of blockchain differentiates
    this tool from existing systems. The immutability of records once they have been
    approved, the consensus based protocols that are required to upload information
    to begin with, and the security that lies at the core of blockchain technology
    itself can help address some of the core issues that often accompany the sharing

    [2001](#CR3)）。建立一个共同的平台来分享和分发网络成员之间的信息已经通过EDI和其他数据管理平台在进行，但区块链的核心组件使这一工具与现有系统有所不同。一旦记录被批准，记录的不可变性，上传信息所需的基于共识的协议以及区块链技术本身的安全性都有助于解决在组织之间共享信息时经常出现的一些核心问题。实质上，不同的区块链平台和选项可以帮助提升并传递到目前为止仅限于组织内部改进的一些改进。

    of advisory services or building new client relationships in general is that,
    for every new iteration or version of an emerging software tool there will inevitably

    off approach and very engaged regulation, lack of clarify from a reporting and
    compliance point of view, and a lack of investor or end user education and training
    all represent potential stumbling blocks toward broader based adoption. That said,
    and acknowledging the difficulty in addressing these issues across a range of
    clients, these do also represent an opportunity for practitioners Lombardo [2005](#CR4)).
    Being seen as, or associated with, emerging technologies that are driving value
    to both internal and external users is very rarely a negative connotation to have
    obtained. What these tools do accomplish, however, is to fundamentally change
    just how different professional services groups are perceived and evaluated from
    the perspective of clients and customers. In other words, the way in which data
    has been processed and analyzed previously is changing, and the actions of professionals
    whose job is to analyze this information must also change.

    professionals or financial advisors, for advice and insights, the reality is that
    customers and clients are going to be able to go to a variety of sources for advice

    the transition from compliance based work to forward looking guidance, a shift
    to niche focused work, and more continuous focused work are all driven by a handful
    of factors, including the reality that customers and clients need not rely on
    financial advisors for advice. The spread of technology, both in terms of technology
    resources and the automation that enables much of the financial services work

    at large, without also having a conversation and analysis related to the privacy
    implications of this technology. As mentioned briefly previously, the roll out
    of GDPR is perhaps the most high profile examples of regulatory pushback and oversight
    in the privacy arena, but there have been many more instances of regulators, lawmakers,
    and other corporations taking an increased interest as it is concerned to privacy
    and protecting the information of both companies and individuals. Tools  and technologies
    such as artificial intelligence, robotic process automation accelerate the pace

    organizations to greater levels of risk with regards to data integrity and security.

- en: An analysis of the privacy implications may also be conducted as a part of the
    analysis connected to the necessary internal controls around new and emerging
    technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, but is also worthy
    of an independent review as well. Client information, be it personal information
    or financial information, is certainly worth taking a few minutes to safeguard
    and protect. That in and of itself is not a new topic or focus of conversation,
    but simply an acknowledgement of just how important and valuable this information
    is, and the damage that can be inflicted if said data falls in unethical hands.
    One specific piece of advisory services or insight that may have gone overlooked
    in prior conversations, however, is the level of interconnectedness between different
    markets actors and pools of client data (Martin et al. [2017](#CR5)). For example,
    even if the data security at accounting firm or brokerage house is secure, maintained
    up to industry standards, and utilized to its full potential, that does not mean
    that every other counterparty embraces the same sort of mindset with regards to
    data and informational security. Investment clients of different financial advisors
    will certainly have to hand over certain levels and types of information to said
    advisors, but almost invariably have also delivered some other sensitive and confidential
    data to banking institutions and/or accounting professionals. Being aware of who –
    besides the primary firm in question – has access to or is storing potentially
    sensitive and private information is an important question to ask as part of any
    advisory conversation.

    of blockchain and artificial intelligence throughout the business landscape it
    becomes simpler to monitor information in near real time. As the internet of things,
    which may sound abstract but may be as simple as linking together information
    and access between phones, tablets, and laptops, becomes less the exception and
    more the rule, the importance of network and institutional security will only
    increase. While it does not appear reasonable to expect that financial services
    professionals will need to become experts in all cybersecurity issues, this advisory
    service opportunity will require a certain level of investment and education on
    the part of practitioners. In addition to educating practitioners on the dangers

    for business purposes. Ultimately the direction and trends of how blockchain and
    other emerging technologies are going to evolve will change and be influenced
    by forces related both to the technology itself and how the applications built
    on top of these tools ultimately function. One of the most important aspects of

    the reality that – despite safeguards and processes put in place – there is always
    a risk of data being lost or corrupted as a result of malicious actions undertaken

    too often this aspect of cybersecurity is treated as a onetime or periodic event,
    with no need to revisit and/or update the actual backup copies on a consistent
    basis. Implementing blockchain based solutions, even if only on the backend of
    operations and data processing, can help to partially automate the need to manually
    remember to backup information. This is due to the permanent nature, including
    the date and time stamp factors, of the various blocks of data that are uploaded
    on the blockchain itself. If a client would, even with blockchain solutions in
    place, like to store a redundant copy of said information, configuring a program

    social security numbers, in order to successfully open investment accounts for

    and financial services space is that “riches are in the niches,” and that is what
    this chapter focuses on. Put another way, Chap. [9](467992_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml)
    is where the book and content contained herein begins to outline specific services –
    reinforced by examples – of how organizations can leverage emerging technology
    tools to reinforce existing business lines and even develop entirely new ones.
    This is a shift and direction that is underway for both accounting organizations
    and financial services institutions, regardless of how individuals or firms feel
    about this shift. Developing and building out new lines of business and service
    offerings to cater to the needs of clients is not something that will be able
    to constructed in a short period of time, but rather is something that needs to
    become integrated within the business at large. Building on a trend already assuming
    a relatively dominant position in the financial services space – automation and
    leveraging automation for higher margin activities, this chapter connects that
    concept to the emerging technology that is already driving change. Regardless
    of the individual tool implemented at the organization, the fact is that with
    every new tool or way or doing business there will be challenges and opportunities
    at organizations seeking to implement said technology. Forward looking practitioners
    need to be able to take advantage of these displacements to produce and deliver
    value to customers. Specifically, after reading this chapter, users will be able
    to connect current business operations, the trend toward automation happening
    regardless, and emerging technology for business applications.
