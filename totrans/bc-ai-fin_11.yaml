    marketplace, and the disruption that these tools bring are felt throughout the
    market and by different actors it will also be important for practitioners and
    organization to obtain the appropriate mindset. There is a phrase used in the
    accounting profession, but is one that can apply to different subsets and areas
    of the financial services profession as well; riches are in the niches (McCausland
    [2000](#CR6)). Generalized services, lower level tasks, and virtually every aspect
    of workplace activity that can be automated will be automated and this will invariably
    cause margin compression, fee restructuring, and the importance of generating
    differentiated services. This is already underway, and the tried and true solutions
    of investing in more automation while also reducing employee headcount will simply
    not be sufficient to compete effectively going forward. Organizations are large
    and sophisticated as BlackRock, Deloitte, and numerous other firms in other industries
    are currently dealing with these forces with a combination of investment, hiring
    of different employees, reduction of current headcount, and launching of digital
    solutions. That is well and good, as well as being absolutely necessary, but a
    different tactic will be required going forward.

    conversation, a prime example of how this transition is underway and eminently
    possible is the transition that has occurred as Morgan Stanley. Following the
    financial crisis there was a period of consolidation and low returns among the
    vast majority of financial institutions, including once high flying investment
    banks. Taking into account the changing market conditions and increased regulations
    coming to the business landscape itself, Morgan Stanley made a strong pivot and
    shift into the wealth management business. Riding the rising asset prices that
    began to catch investor attention following the 2009 lows, this approach and business
    line has benefitted the organization in terms of profits, market share growth,
    and the ability to attract new talent to the firm. Now, it is true that building
    out such a line of business does also increase the overall exposure of MS to market
    prices and volatility, which did rear its ugly head in first quarter of 2019,
    but that is a business risk. The point of this discussion is not to praise or
    criticize the specific shift or approach taken by MS, but to illustrate the fact
    that substantial transitions are indeed possible.

    business model, banks – including commercial and investment banks – are also increasingly
    investing in technology tools, solutions, and applications. Whether it takes the
    form a more sophisticated mobile apps, better websites and options for customers,
    or a digitally based banking platform such as Marcum the trend is clear. If such
    venerable and well establishing institutions such as Goldman Sachs are developing
    and launching online products and services to appeal to new and different areas
    of the marketplace that should indicated just how important these transitions
    and shits can be for the marketplace. These examples are high profile for sure,
    but illustrate the impact that increased in automation and decentralization are
    already driving in the marketplace between different actors. Regardless of what
    is the specific focus of the organization or the product or service that is customized,
    the changing transitions is clear. Being a general practitioner is a career path
    and arc that has diminished in viability across medical, engineering, and other
    consulting fields; why should financial services do any different? Acknowledging
    that the financial services fields are not unique in terms of what is happening
    in the professional landscape also means that there are opportunities to learn
    from the experience of others.

    and built up by firms using emerging technology tools it is entirely possible
    to see what directions may drive change and innovation going forward. For example,
    the accounting firm Withum Smith and Brown recently launched an entire digital
    advisory services arm focused exclusively on blockchain, cryptoassets, and offering
    assurance work connected to these tools. Even more exciting, however, are the
    possibilities and opportunities that arise when these various technology tools
    are able to be stacked and combined (Greenstein and Hunton [2003](#CR2)). Looking
    for an example, the following scenario is entirely possible and not as far removed
    from reality as may initially be thought. In a consortium or other type of private
    blockchain based environment an accounting firm, an audit engagement can be- for
    the most part – almost entirely automated and streamlined. Leveraging the tamper
    resistant structure of the blockchain itself means that a large percentage of
    confirmations and valuations no longer need to be handled manually or be staff
    members. In addition to the reduced manual work and tasks that are necessary by
    engagement team members this also means that likelihood of errors, double counts,
    and other inefficient uses of time can be reduced. The lower likelihood of errors
    and omissions associated with the work products themselves also allows the organization
    to leverage automation tools to assist with the audit process itself. Increasing
    the options and opportunities for increased review by artificial intelligence
    tools and automation based platforms means that more comprehensive audit results
    and reports are possible.

    different service lines and opportunities can be constructed around the opportunities
    enabled via increased technology integration. Other service lines can be built
    around the continuous attestation and reporting of information, including the
    ability of accountants and auditors to monitor in real time and produce forward
    looking dashboards and information. On top of being able to develop these service
    lines for clients this also means that the forward looking data and reports can
    be delivered at higher margins than historical looking data and information. Such
    a scenario represents the most clear cut example of how different aspects of emerging
    technology can drive significant business changes across different industry lines.

    always virtually been an information asymmetry with regards to financial data,
    and this will only be amplified in a marketplace continuously infused with financial
    technology and applications (Ball [2017](#CR1)). Certified professionals, by the
    nature of their education and training, have long been a part of a so-called grand
    bargain that has existed in the marketplace. This so-called grand bargain, in
    terms of actual business applications and use cases, is defined by a few core
    characteristics. First, there are a limited number of individuals that can be
    employed within the professional classes that include attorneys, engineers, doctors,
    and financial professionals. This is due to not only the formal education in the
    form of college degrees, but also the continuing education and retraining that
    is often as part of the licensure process. Second, the limited number of individuals
    that can be a part of the professional class create a situation where being employed
    in one of these sectors – like financial services – can be quite lucrative. Margins
    have traditionally been healthy in the financial services sector, and regardless
    of individual opinions on the appropriateness of said margins, the fact remains
    that they exist.

    two pillars of providing financial services information to the marketplace. These
    pillars and core drivers of the profession include both the analysis of complicated
    financial information, and the reporting/communication of this information to
    both internal or external end user group, including the most recent integration
    of privacy into the data management and distribution conversation (Stecking and
    Schebesch [2015](#CR7)). Both of these core components of financial services are
    linked to the grand bargain between the market and professional employees. Linking
    back to the grand bargain indicated and introduced above, the analysis and interpretation
    of financial information may seem like a mystery to end users, and this is due
    directly to the lack of information symmetry in the marketplace. Information,
    after all, is what drives the business decision making process across different
    industry segments, including the financial services. That said, in order for decisions
    to made effectively, both parties – be they individuals or institutions – must
    have equal access to the data used to make the decisions that are impacting that
    organization. This may seem like a relatively straight forward statement of fact;
    after all in virtually every other situation everyone who is involved in the decision
    making process would want to have access to the underlying information.

    communication and analysis since the financial services landscape was developed
    and introduced overall. In a decentralized model of doing business, transmitting
    information, and delivering value to the marketplace, the traditional role of
    financial services professionals is being disrupted. Put simply, the entire model
    of how individuals and institutions .operate in the financial services space is
    based around the fact that the information and analysis provided to the market
    originates from a centralized source. Translating this into business reality,
    however, provides the relatively simple concept for communication; the people
    served by financial services professionals enter into the conversation a fundamental
    disadvantage. The changing nature of both client information, client needs and
    expectations, and the technology available to both firms and clients is beginning
    to create opportunities as well as challenges (Fig. [9.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_9_Chapter/467992_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_9_Chapter/467992_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.png)

    while blockchain has a substantial amount of upside and potential, that – in essence –
    it is merely another technology tool in a long line of technology tools and improvement
    projects. Obviously increasing efficiency and the speed with which data is processed,
    analyzed, and communicated to end users is a good thing, but that in and of itself
    is nothing new. Blockchain, especially private or consortium blockchains that
    are built, maintained, and utilized by a number of different organizations can
    generate a very distinctive business benefit. Traditional process improvement
    projects, initiatives, and efforts that are normally underway at organizations
    are focused on improving performance within the organization. Blockchain, in contrast,
    creates and delivers efficiency benefits between different organizations, or generates
    benefits within the broader ecosystem.
  prefs: []

    examples and applications have tended to arise in the supply chain and logistics
    space. Different organizations may utilize different specific processes and projects
    within the firm itself, rather obviously, but a common point that can be agreed
    upon is that many of the pain points  in the business process occur when data
    must be transferred between organizations. This includes, but is not limited to,
    the development of new practice niches centered around emerging technology and
    technology areas (Kahan [2001](#CR3)). Establishing a common platform to share
    and distribute information between network members is already underway via EDI
    and other data management platforms, but the core components of blockchain differentiates
    this tool from existing systems. The immutability of records once they have been
    approved, the consensus based protocols that are required to upload information
    to begin with, and the security that lies at the core of blockchain technology
    itself can help address some of the core issues that often accompany the sharing
    of information between organizations. In essence, different blockchain platforms
    and options can help elevate and deliver some of the improvements that, to date,
    have been limited to internal improvements within organizations.

    inaccurate name for a tool or suite of technology tools that can deliver benefits
    to the different users. Drilling down specifically, some of the most practical
    benefits and upsides of artificial intelligence can and should be in alignment
    with other technology tools as they enter the marketplace. No technology tool
    or platform, regardless of how powerful it may be on an individual basis, can
    fundamentally change a business; different technologies must be integrated into
    current business processes. This is equally as true for artificial intelligence
    tools and options as it is for other technology projects and initiatives; the
    true power of AI and tools like AI are when they are meshed and can augment existing
    processes. An additional key point to emphasize, remind customers and clients
    about is that there is not one general category of artificial intelligence, but
    rather multiple categories and different classes that may be more or less helpful
    depending on the organization in question.

- en: A final point to consistently mention and bring up when developing new lines
    of advisory services or building new client relationships in general is that,
    for every new iteration or version of an emerging software tool there will inevitably
    be bumps in the road. Regulatory uncertainty, most likely swinging between a hands
    off approach and very engaged regulation, lack of clarify from a reporting and
    compliance point of view, and a lack of investor or end user education and training
    all represent potential stumbling blocks toward broader based adoption. That said,
    and acknowledging the difficulty in addressing these issues across a range of
    clients, these do also represent an opportunity for practitioners Lombardo [2005](#CR4)).
    Being seen as, or associated with, emerging technologies that are driving value
    to both internal and external users is very rarely a negative connotation to have
    obtained. What these tools do accomplish, however, is to fundamentally change
    just how different professional services groups are perceived and evaluated from
    the perspective of clients and customers. In other words, the way in which data
    has been processed and analyzed previously is changing, and the actions of professionals
    whose job is to analyze this information must also change.

    process. Media at large, publishing, education, automobile manufacturing, manufacturing
    in general, medicine, and construction represent just a few of the areas and industry
    groups that have experienced seismic shifts in how business is conducted. At this
    point, and reflecting the reality that no industry is truly that different from
    other businesses, it seems only natural that the financial services landscape
    will also evolve and change alongside organizations. Especially as technologies
    like blockchain and artificial intelligence continue to become both more accessible
    to end users, and capable of handling larger amounts of information, it is certainly
    going to be a challenge for professionals seeking to develop and evolve in the

    financial services will be conducted and interact with the broader marketplace.
    Centralization of information, regardless of whether it takes the form of a bank,
    accounting organization, or some other trusted third party, also creates a situation
    in which the broader marketplace is dependent on financial services professionals
    to interpret, analyze, and report information. Decentralizing the storage, transmission,
    and analysis of data – shifting the availability of information from the hands
    of a few professionals to the broader market – represents a definitive shift in
    how financial data is analyzed and provided. Put simply, for financial services
    professionals that wish to not only survive, but thrive, in the marketplace of
    the future, these individuals must become more comfortable dealing with a democratized
    information environment. Automation, digitization, and the increased streamlined
    nature of how information is processed and reported creates numerous opportunities.
    That said, it is also important to not lose sight of the reality that, as technology
    becomes increasingly integrated, that controls and other safeguards cannot simply
    be delegated to technology tools.

    actually made in the marketplace, the relevance and applicability of data to different
    decisions will only continue to increase. While financial information may seem
    the most relevant place to begin the increased analysis and reporting of different
    data sources, the rise of increased quantification of information has an impact
    on every aspect of the organization. From improved operational metrics, to more
    comprehensive reporting in general, and to a more continuous framework for distributing
    this information to end users, the vast increase in available information, as
    well as the ability of organizations to effectively leverage this data represents

    from a traditional operating and business model to one augmented and improved

    professionals or financial advisors, for advice and insights, the reality is that
    customers and clients are going to be able to go to a variety of sources for advice
    and information. The shifts and changes that are discussed in this text, be it
    the transition from compliance based work to forward looking guidance, a shift
    to niche focused work, and more continuous focused work are all driven by a handful
    of factors, including the reality that customers and clients need not rely on
    financial advisors for advice. The spread of technology, both in terms of technology
    resources and the automation that enables much of the financial services work
    to be streamlined and automated means that professionals will need to acknowledge
    the changing power dynamic in the marketplace.

    be treated as partners. If not entirely as equals in terms of subject matter expertise,
    at least equal in terms of what needs and expectations mean for the relationship

    at large, without also having a conversation and analysis related to the privacy
    implications of this technology. As mentioned briefly previously, the roll out
    of GDPR is perhaps the most high profile examples of regulatory pushback and oversight
    in the privacy arena, but there have been many more instances of regulators, lawmakers,
    and other corporations taking an increased interest as it is concerned to privacy
    and protecting the information of both companies and individuals. Tools  and technologies
    such as artificial intelligence, robotic process automation accelerate the pace
    at which data can be analyzed, created, and communicated, but may also expose
    organizations to greater levels of risk with regards to data integrity and security.
  prefs: []

- en: An analysis of the privacy implications may also be conducted as a part of the
    analysis connected to the necessary internal controls around new and emerging
    technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, but is also worthy
    of an independent review as well. Client information, be it personal information
    or financial information, is certainly worth taking a few minutes to safeguard
    and protect. That in and of itself is not a new topic or focus of conversation,
    but simply an acknowledgement of just how important and valuable this information
    is, and the damage that can be inflicted if said data falls in unethical hands.
    One specific piece of advisory services or insight that may have gone overlooked
    in prior conversations, however, is the level of interconnectedness between different
    markets actors and pools of client data (Martin et al. [2017](#CR5)). For example,
    even if the data security at accounting firm or brokerage house is secure, maintained
    up to industry standards, and utilized to its full potential, that does not mean
    that every other counterparty embraces the same sort of mindset with regards to
    data and informational security. Investment clients of different financial advisors
    will certainly have to hand over certain levels and types of information to said
    advisors, but almost invariably have also delivered some other sensitive and confidential
    data to banking institutions and/or accounting professionals. Being aware of who –
    besides the primary firm in question – has access to or is storing potentially
    sensitive and private information is an important question to ask as part of any
    advisory conversation.

    of blockchain and artificial intelligence throughout the business landscape it
    becomes simpler to monitor information in near real time. As the internet of things,
    which may sound abstract but may be as simple as linking together information
    and access between phones, tablets, and laptops, becomes less the exception and
    more the rule, the importance of network and institutional security will only
    increase. While it does not appear reasonable to expect that financial services
    professionals will need to become experts in all cybersecurity issues, this advisory
    service opportunity will require a certain level of investment and education on
    the part of practitioners. In addition to educating practitioners on the dangers
    and pitfalls that accompany an increasingly digitized environment, however, this
    transition and evolution also points to certain key topic areas that should be
    a part of any investment or advisory engagement.

    to likely advisory focused on based information and knowledge will not always
    be simple or as easy as might be desired. While it is true that many of these
    new opportunities are indeed focused on improving current product and service
    offerings it is also important for practitioners to take into account the new
    opportunities and options that can – and already are – being improved and implemented
    for business purposes. Ultimately the direction and trends of how blockchain and
    other emerging technologies are going to evolve will change and be influenced
    by forces related both to the technology itself and how the applications built
    on top of these tools ultimately function. One of the most important aspects of
    technology in the age of connected technology and distributed communications is
    the reality that – despite safeguards and processes put in place – there is always
    a risk of data being lost or corrupted as a result of malicious actions undertaken
    by different market groups. In addition to the risks that appear and are a part
    of the normal operation of any organizations, the combination of emerging technology
    and virtually unlimited storage can create a situation that can render damage

    too often this aspect of cybersecurity is treated as a onetime or periodic event,
    with no need to revisit and/or update the actual backup copies on a consistent
    basis. Implementing blockchain based solutions, even if only on the backend of
    operations and data processing, can help to partially automate the need to manually
    remember to backup information. This is due to the permanent nature, including
    the date and time stamp factors, of the various blocks of data that are uploaded
    on the blockchain itself. If a client would, even with blockchain solutions in
    place, like to store a redundant copy of said information, configuring a program
    to automatically back up and distribute an updated copy of records and transactions
    that is an effective use of combining these emerging technologies.

    that of identity verification and reporting. Whether it is done simply to remain
    in compliance with regulations such as KYC or AML, or integrated into a comprehensive
    audit or attestation engagement the importance of verifying and confirming the
    identity of asset holders is critical. Especially as it connects to both blockchain
    and the cryptocurrencies operating on the underlying asset platforms themselves,
    remaining in compliance with these regulations is important for both practitioners
    and client organizations. It may seem contradictory to once again reference and

    the internet and other technology resources are often repeated and used, but are

    generated hundreds of billions in combined market capitalization, but the regulatory
    frameworks and guidelines have yet to catch up. At the end of 2018 and continuing

    as the USD or the Euro, but in order to bridge the gap between where said cryptocurrencies
    currently are, and where they could end up, is the regulatory framework that currencies
    must exist within. Financial practitioners will be able to address these needs,
    and the current market gap in this area by advising clients and customers as to
    what needs arise from clients seeking to ensure compliance with said regulation.

    needed to remain in compliance with different regulations may not change, the
    method by which these pieces of information are stored and transmitted will change.
    Customers and investors still often do have to provide such information, including
    social security numbers, in order to successfully open investment accounts for
    various cryptoassets. An option and vector for storing these types of information
    should be to store these types of information on a blockchain itself. If cryptocurrencies
    are stored, traded, and optimized by blockchain platforms, it does seem to make
    sense that the personally identifiable information associated with customers should
    also be stored in an equally secure environment.

    professionals should also be to assist both individual and institutional clients
    as they seek to contend with a changing and shifting regulatory landscape. This
    may seem like a run of the mill statement, but in a nascent and emerging market
    such as cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency regulation, remaining up to speed on
    the array of regulations and rules is not as straight as it may appear. Coordinating
    with legal experts, including those focused on international taxation issues,
    will be necessary, but should not viewed as a negative development. Rathe, this
    change should be viewed as an opportunity for practitioners to leverage technology
    to provide additional and more extensive advisory services.

- en: There is a phrase that has begun to gain significant popularity in the accounting
    and financial services space is that “riches are in the niches,” and that is what
    this chapter focuses on. Put another way, Chap. [9](467992_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml)
    is where the book and content contained herein begins to outline specific services –
    reinforced by examples – of how organizations can leverage emerging technology
    tools to reinforce existing business lines and even develop entirely new ones.
    This is a shift and direction that is underway for both accounting organizations
    and financial services institutions, regardless of how individuals or firms feel
    about this shift. Developing and building out new lines of business and service
    offerings to cater to the needs of clients is not something that will be able
    to constructed in a short period of time, but rather is something that needs to
    become integrated within the business at large. Building on a trend already assuming
    a relatively dominant position in the financial services space – automation and
    leveraging automation for higher margin activities, this chapter connects that
    concept to the emerging technology that is already driving change. Regardless
    of the individual tool implemented at the organization, the fact is that with
    every new tool or way or doing business there will be challenges and opportunities
    at organizations seeking to implement said technology. Forward looking practitioners
    need to be able to take advantage of these displacements to produce and deliver
    value to customers. Specifically, after reading this chapter, users will be able
    to connect current business operations, the trend toward automation happening
    regardless, and emerging technology for business applications.
