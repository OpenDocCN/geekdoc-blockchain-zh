    not have to delve into the subtleties of economic or technical concepts.

- en: Here I suggest that you buy a certain amount of different coins among the top
    10 best cryptocurrencies for today. In other words, you will buy several market
    leaders. The coins, whose price will skyrocket, will compensate for the losses
    provoked by the failure of the other coins.

  zh: 在这里，我建议你购买今天最好的 10 种加密货币中的一种。换句话说，你会购买几只市场领导者。那些价格会飙升的货币将弥补其他货币失败所造成的损失。
- en: This strategy also implies huge risks. Nothing can protect you from the fact
    that seemingly stable coins thus far can considerably fall down in value next
    year. You should remember that right now there are no fundamental grounds protecting
    Bitcoin from failing, which, for example, may be provoked by the inability to
    withstand the competition of other coins. This is a very real possibility if only
    because Bitcoin is one of the technically weakest cryptocurrencies.

  zh: 这个策略也意味着巨大的风险。没有什么能保护你，看似稳定的货币明年可能会大幅贬值。你应该记住，现在没有任何基本原因能保护比特币免受失败，这可能由其他货币的竞争无力引起。这一个非常真实，因为比特币是技术上最弱的加密货币之一。
- en: Therefore, if you do not want to become a hostage of circumstance, do not place
    your bets on just one currency as I did five years ago. I want to share this story

    6 万美元。
- en: So how did I manage to spend such a big sum of money in one night? It’s actually
    quite simple. One fine evening, I decided to relax with my mates in a small town
    where my friend lived. We went to a bar, famous for the most delicious fish and
    stunning cocktails in town. Back then, I followed the price of the currency I
    bought earlier (Bitcoin) several times a day. I had noticed it was going down
    every hour. For some reason, I wasn’t very upset when my cell phone battery died,
    and I could not check the Bitcoin price on the exchange. I believed the matter
    could wait until later.

  zh: 那么我究竟是怎么在短短一晚上花掉这么一大笔钱的呢？其实很简单。某个美好的夜晚，我决定和我的朋友们在我的一个朋友所在的小镇上放松一下。我们去了当地著名的酒吧，那里有最美味的鱼和惊人的鸡尾酒。当时，我随时关注着我之前购买的货币（比特币）的价格，一天要关注几次。我注意到，它的价格每小时都在下跌。不知为何，当我的手机电池耗尽，我无法在交易所上查看比特币价格时，我并不太沮丧。我认为这件事可以稍后再说。

  zh: 我们在酒吧度过的那三个小时里，我在交易所上损失了超过 6 万美元。
- en: If I had been less dismissive of the dying phone and had access to the cryptocurrency
    exchange, I could have had the opportunity to sell the currency before incurring
    such devastating losses. I will definitely remember that night in the bar for
    the rest of my life.

    in the market.

  zh: 许多人认为交易就是分析、图案和技术建模，但交易员的工作实际上是对市场正在发生的事情的主观评估。

    (grin), is to predict what cryptocurrencies will grow in the market. After that,
    traders need to predict the best point for entering the market. What's next? They
    should continue making forecasts of when coin prices will start to fall.

  zh: 好的交易员首先应该做的第一件事，除了喝一杯威士忌（笑脸），就是预测哪些数字货币将在市场上增长。在那之后，交易员需要预测最佳的市场进入点。接下来呢？他们还应该继续预测硬币价格何时开始下跌。
- en: However, the most important part of trading is having a colossal amount of experience
    and even a little bit of luck. A trader must also repeat all the above actions
    constantly. This is the problem because everything does not always work out well,
    whereas the risks have to be assumed all the time.

  zh: 然而，交易最重要的部分是拥有丰富的经验，甚至是一点点运气。交易者还必须不断重复上述所有行动。这是问题所在，因为不是所有事情都能一帆风顺，而风险必须始终承担。

- en: Nowadays, the cryptocurrency market offers more opportunities for active investors.
    This kind of strategy suits you if you have a lot of free time (and money), enough
    experience, and you want to make big and swift profits. Although this strategy
    is very profitable, it is also very risky, especially for beginners.

  zh: 如今，数字货币市场为积极投资者提供了更多机会。这种策略适合你有大量空闲时间（和资金），足够经验，并且想赚取大量快速利润的情况。尽管这种策略非常盈利，但它也非常危险，尤其是对初学者来说。
- en: The principle thing of ICO strategy, which I also call startups, is as follows.
    The cryptocurrency economy has come up with a very simple way for people who have
    innovative and interesting ideas to fund their projects. They no longer need to
    pound the pavement, begging and convincing big companies of the profitability
    of investing in their idea. Now these inventors and developers simply share a
    proposal on their website. If you’re interested in their idea, you publish the
    address of your wallet to receive tokens if this idea proves to be a success.
    The risk is that you have to invest money right now for a potential reward in
    the future.
  id: totrans-25

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我认为，ICO策略（我也称之为初创公司）的主要问题是这样的。数字货币经济为那些有创新和有趣想法的人们提供了一种非常简单的方式来资助他们的项目。他们不再需要在街头游荡，乞求并说服大公司投资他们的想法是盈利的。现在，这些发明家和开发者只需在他们的网站上分享一个提议。如果您对他们的想法感兴趣，您会在网站上发布您的钱包地址，如果这个想法成功，您将收到代币。风险在于，您现在必须投资资金，以期在未来获得潜在的回报。
- en: In the past, the rules of the game with ICOs were quite simple. I give you one
    dollar, and you give me two tokens, Now some ICOs go to absurd lengths. Generally
    speaking, after have you invested in ICO, it may turn out that you can exchange
    their tokens only on Friday at midnight at the full moon and only if you are a
    mermaid with a blue tail. Maybe my example is obviously a bit of an exaggeration,
    but it perfectly demonstrates the opacity of the rules of most startups (ICOs).

  zh: 过去，ICO的游戏规则非常简单。我给你一美元，你给我两枚代币，现在一些ICO项目已经到了荒谬的地步。总的来说，在您投资ICO之后，可能发现您只能在周五午夜满月时，且只有长着蓝色尾巴的美人鱼才能交换它们的代币。也许我的例子有点夸张，但它完美地展示了大多数初创公司（ICO）规则的晦涩性。
- en: If it was not very difficult to find a grain of truth among the variety of ICOs
    half a year ago (since only a few of them appeared in a week, and they could be
    easily analyzed), now new ICOs appear almost every hour, and you have no time

  zh: 我会建议初学者不要被ICO的诱惑冲昏头脑。
- en: First of all, you need to have a good handle on the business niche which you
    are going to invest in. If you are savvy in it, you can analyze it and understand
    if it has prospects for success. I also advise you to listen to what experienced
    investors and experts say and pay less attention to what is written on the ICO’s
    website. I would even say that you should not invest in any ICO that is not mentioned
    in at least three professional analytical reports from recognized experts.

  zh: 首先，你需要对你打算投资的业务领域有深入的了解。如果你精通它，你可以分析它并理解它是否有成功的前景。我还建议你倾听有经验的投资者和专家的意见，并少关注ICO网站上的内容。我甚至可以说，你不应该投资任何没有在至少三份来自知名专家的专业分析报告中提到的ICO。

  zh: 低价股
- en: 'If you know a thing or two about the exchange trade, the notion of penny stocks
    should definitely be familiar to you. Roughly speaking, these are shares of the
    company that nobody needs. However, these shares have one feature: they are so
    cheap that nothing prevents them from shooting up tenfold in value. Such a magical
    leap can occur because of good news, a little market manipulation, or any other

- en: So how can you take advantage of this strategy? You buy the oddest and more
    obscure coins and then wait and see how the situation will develop.  During the
    year, the prices of some of your coins may skyrocket. If this happens, you should
    immediately sell this currency. If you bought fifty coins, a leap in the price
    of even one super-cheap coin will compensate for your entire investment portfolio.

  zh: 那么，你如何利用这一策略呢？你购买最奇特和最不为人知的货币，然后等待看看情况如何发展。在一年中，你某些货币的价格可能会飞速上涨。如果这种情况发生，你应该立即出售这种货币。如果你买了五十枚货币，即使是最便宜的一枚货币价格的大幅上涨，也会弥补你整个投资组合的损失。
- en: This kind of strategy doesn’t allow you to dive deep into the principles of
    doing cryptocurrency business. All you need to do is buy "garbage" and sell it
    in time. However, this strategy is not my prerogative as it resembles a casino.
    You need no skills or knowledge, only luck. You cannot in any way influence what
    happens or manage risks as everything depends on good luck.

  zh: 这种策略不允许你深入研究加密货币业务的原则。你只需要做的是购买“垃圾”，并及时出售。然而，这个策略并不适合我，因为它类似于赌场。你不需要技能或知识，只需要运气。你无法以任何方式影响发生的事情或管理风险，因为一切取决于好运。

  zh: 如果你没有加密货币业务的经验，但有钱可以玩，这个策略非常适合你。然而，你需要准备好承担风险，并将你的钱托付给陌生人。加密货币业务的世界不受任何法律约束，所以没有人能保证为你赚钱的公司或个人不会拿走你的钱，然后逃到一个温暖的国家。
- en: There are a lot of companies in the market that offer profit in return for trust.
    Some companies, for example, offer mining contracts to those who want to mine
    but don’t have the capital to invest in all the equipment and space. This is called
    cloud mining. Another type of company is cryptocurrency funds. These companies
    don’t know how to mine but are good at guessing promising coins. The third type
    is ICO mutual funds. These guys spend their time examining the startups in the
    market, which they will later invest your money in. Finally, the fourth option
    is trading. You give control of your money to someone else, who will do the trading
