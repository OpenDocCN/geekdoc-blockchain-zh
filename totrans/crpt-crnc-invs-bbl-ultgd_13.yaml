    So, following this strategy, you only need to buy Bitcoin.

    not have to delve into the subtleties of economic or technical concepts.

    has its risks, which I’ll explain in a bit.

- en: Here I suggest that you buy a certain amount of different coins among the top
    10 best cryptocurrencies for today. In other words, you will buy several market
    leaders. The coins, whose price will skyrocket, will compensate for the losses
    provoked by the failure of the other coins.

- en: This strategy also implies huge risks. Nothing can protect you from the fact
    that seemingly stable coins thus far can considerably fall down in value next
    year. You should remember that right now there are no fundamental grounds protecting
    Bitcoin from failing, which, for example, may be provoked by the inability to
    withstand the competition of other coins. This is a very real possibility if only
    because Bitcoin is one of the technically weakest cryptocurrencies.

    your bets on just one currency as I did five years ago. I want to share this story
    with you. Let me tell you about the most expensive night of my life, which cost
    me $60,000.

- en: So how did I manage to spend such a big sum of money in one night? It’s actually
    quite simple. One fine evening, I decided to relax with my mates in a small town
    where my friend lived. We went to a bar, famous for the most delicious fish and
    stunning cocktails in town. Back then, I followed the price of the currency I
    bought earlier (Bitcoin) several times a day. I had noticed it was going down
    every hour. For some reason, I wasn’t very upset when my cell phone battery died,
    and I could not check the Bitcoin price on the exchange. I believed the matter
    could wait until later.

    had fun at the bar.

    exchange, I could have had the opportunity to sell the currency before incurring
    such devastating losses. I will definitely remember that night in the bar for
    the rest of my life.

    but the trader's work is actually a subjective assessment of what is happening
    in the market.

- en: The first thing good traders should do, besides drinking a glass of whiskey
    (grin), is to predict what cryptocurrencies will grow in the market. After that,
    traders need to predict the best point for entering the market. What's next? They
    should continue making forecasts of when coin prices will start to fall.
  prefs: []

- en: However, the most important part of trading is having a colossal amount of experience
    and even a little bit of luck. A trader must also repeat all the above actions
    constantly. This is the problem because everything does not always work out well,
    whereas the risks have to be assumed all the time.

    who have a lot of time, and, most importantly, are strong in spirit.

- en: Nowadays, the cryptocurrency market offers more opportunities for active investors.
    This kind of strategy suits you if you have a lot of free time (and money), enough
    experience, and you want to make big and swift profits. Although this strategy
    is very profitable, it is also very risky, especially for beginners.

- en: The principle thing of ICO strategy, which I also call startups, is as follows.
    The cryptocurrency economy has come up with a very simple way for people who have
    innovative and interesting ideas to fund their projects. They no longer need to
    pound the pavement, begging and convincing big companies of the profitability
    of investing in their idea. Now these inventors and developers simply share a
    proposal on their website. If you’re interested in their idea, you publish the
    address of your wallet to receive tokens if this idea proves to be a success.
    The risk is that you have to invest money right now for a potential reward in
    the future.

- en: In the past, the rules of the game with ICOs were quite simple. I give you one
    dollar, and you give me two tokens, Now some ICOs go to absurd lengths. Generally
    speaking, after have you invested in ICO, it may turn out that you can exchange
    their tokens only on Friday at midnight at the full moon and only if you are a
    mermaid with a blue tail. Maybe my example is obviously a bit of an exaggeration,
    but it perfectly demonstrates the opacity of the rules of most startups (ICOs).

- en: If it was not very difficult to find a grain of truth among the variety of ICOs
    half a year ago (since only a few of them appeared in a week, and they could be
    easily analyzed), now new ICOs appear almost every hour, and you have no time
    to examine them all.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, you need to have a good handle on the business niche which you
    are going to invest in. If you are savvy in it, you can analyze it and understand
    if it has prospects for success. I also advise you to listen to what experienced
    investors and experts say and pay less attention to what is written on the ICO’s
    website. I would even say that you should not invest in any ICO that is not mentioned
    in at least three professional analytical reports from recognized experts.

    should definitely be familiar to you. Roughly speaking, these are shares of the
    company that nobody needs. However, these shares have one feature: they are so
    cheap that nothing prevents them from shooting up tenfold in value. Such a magical
    leap can occur because of good news, a little market manipulation, or any other
    reason.'

    obscure coins and then wait and see how the situation will develop.  During the
    year, the prices of some of your coins may skyrocket. If this happens, you should
    immediately sell this currency. If you bought fifty coins, a leap in the price
    of even one super-cheap coin will compensate for your entire investment portfolio.

    doing cryptocurrency business. All you need to do is buy "garbage" and sell it
    in time. However, this strategy is not my prerogative as it resembles a casino.
    You need no skills or knowledge, only luck. You cannot in any way influence what
    happens or manage risks as everything depends on good luck.

    business but have money to play with. However, you need to be ready to take risks
    and entrust your money to strangers. The world of cryptocurrency business is regulated
    by no laws, so nobody can guarantee you that a company or person who promised
    to earn money for you will not take your money and take off to some warm country.

- en: There are a lot of companies in the market that offer profit in return for trust.
    Some companies, for example, offer mining contracts to those who want to mine
    but don’t have the capital to invest in all the equipment and space. This is called
    cloud mining. Another type of company is cryptocurrency funds. These companies
    don’t know how to mine but are good at guessing promising coins. The third type
    is ICO mutual funds. These guys spend their time examining the startups in the
    market, which they will later invest your money in. Finally, the fourth option
    is trading. You give control of your money to someone else, who will do the trading
    for you.

    a profit as well as your risks.'

    and premises, others will need funds, some will need information, and you can
    make money by fulfilling their needs.
