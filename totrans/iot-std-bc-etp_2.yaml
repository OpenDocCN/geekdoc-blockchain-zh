    and therefore a single architecture cannot be used for all possible IoT implementations.
    An IoT implementation differs from enterprise to enterprise. As an example, IoT
    for manufacturing (IIoT) is different from an IoT implementation in the healthcare
    sector (IoMT). In fact, IoT is like an umbrella around all possible Internet and
    non-Internet-enabled devices and computers around us. Therefore, the IoT architecture
    needs to be open enough with open protocols to support a variety of existing network
    applications and use cases. Additionally, middleware for scalability, security,

    achieve this objective, and workarounds need to be created, since there are many
    legacy devices in enterprises which are resource constrained and battery operated
    – the communication of one device to others requires lots of resources such as
    computing power, energy, and bandwidth, which these legacy devices are challenged
    with. In addition to these constraints, each device communicates in a different
    language (called a protocol), and therefore it is not always easy for devices
    to directly talk to each other. This is the main reason why Smart IoT Gateways
    have come into play and are the workaround for any device, be it modern or legacy,

    rather than relying on a central location that can be thousands of miles away.
    This means that data, especially real-time data, is processed by the Smart IoT
    Gateways which are hosted near to the location where devices reside. Because of
    this, enterprises do not face latency issues since data is shared back and forth
    and processed near to the devices. In addition, with Smart IoT Gateways, companies

    maintenance. In the old and traditional IoT implementations, the architecture
    had a rules engine that performs repetitive tasks, such as if a sensor data hits
    a defined threshold, it does a specific predefined task. As an example, if the
    temperature of a furnace goes beyond 70 degree Celsius, it shuts down the furnace.
    However, all these rules and values are hardcoded. With the introduction of AI
    in the IoT architecture, instead of having these rules hardcoded, enterprises

    there is no hardcoding of business logic or rules. With AI, we are letting the

    the best place to perform AI based on the data and the use cases it is implementing.
    For one of the manufacturing companies, we used Amazon AWS Snowball Edge to perform
    heavy compute operations near to the IoT devices, that is, Smart IoT Gateway.
    Snowball Edge is capable of running a full-blown machine learning model at the
    IoT Gateway. The way this works is that you train the model in the public cloud,
    and then you bring the model to the IoT Gateway and run it. And when it detects
    that the predictions are not very accurate, it goes back to the data lake which
    is hosted at the Full Stack IoT Platform level to get further trained and again
    gets deployed to the IoT Gateway, and this cycle continues until the algorithm
    is performing actions with 100% accuracy.

    that they deploy devices in their OT estate which have security built into the
    device, and this is a must. Not only security needs to be built into the device
    but there should be a way to fix any security issues as they come up via software
    updates or upgrades.

    constrained and do not contain the compute resources necessary to implement strong
    security. As such, many devices do not offer advanced security features. For example,
    most sensors that monitor humidity or temperature cannot handle advanced encryption
    or other security measures. Traditionally, numerous IoT devices are built to be
    placed in the field or on a machine and left until end of life, and they hardly
    ever receive security updates or patches. Therefore, from some enterprise’s viewpoint,
    building security from the start can be costly and would slow down development.
    However, for enterprises aspiring to adopt IoT for their business, building security
    in the devices is a must. However, the level of security required in devices also
    depends on the use cases and industry. As an example, a hacker will be less interested
    to break into an agriculture IoT device and more keen to break into a manufacturing
    plant.

    they have higher processing power for running more intensive applications. More
    power means better software, and better software means more vulnerabilities for
    a hacker to exploit. Another key reason why IoT Gateways become a hotspot for
    many hackers is because of its location as an edge device between the Internet
    and the intranet. The Gateway is typically the first point of entry for any security
    threat (as well as a system’s first line of defense).

    methodologies. Messages should be encrypted and can only be decrypted by the recipient
    using cryptographic keys. This allows a Gateway device to still accept and pass

    key component and is the ability for one person to effectively deal with others
    and for enterprises to perform business and to build civilization as well. We
    traditionally have centralized institutions that manage the trust part for every
    transaction. As an example, in a money exchange transaction, since we do not trust
    unknown individuals or businesses, an intermediary, such as a bank which we trust,
    sits in the middle and coordinates payments for us. And this is a model that allows
    us to think about resolving the problem of trust so that we can confidently enter
    into exchange with others. However, intermediaries add a lot of friction and costs
    along with several transactional challenges. Blockchain technology is trying to
    solve this problem of trust in a much secure and cheaper way without anyone needing
    to depend on an intermediary. This is not only limited to banks but applies to
    public utilities and institutional controls where there is some form of exchange

    only. And in terms of costs, the fundamental thing which blockchain will address
    is reducing cost of transaction. As an example, person A wakes up and authenticates
    themselves, buys something online, and engages in some sort of digital transaction.
    Every such transaction needs to be verified, such as who is involved, the amounts
    exchanged, and so on, and the society spends a lot of resources and money to making
    sure that those attributes (transactions and actors) are correct and that transactions
    are executed without problems. Currently, there are several intermediaries as
    part of each such transaction. Blockchain is a technology that drastically reduces
    the cost to verify that a specific attribute is true and genuine.

    starts from agricultural production to selling the product by the retailer to
    consumption by a consumer. In such a setup, there are different actors involved
    such as farmers who produce fruits and vegetables, freight management companies
    that transport these products from the farm to the stores using the right temperature-controlled
    fridges, retailers who sell these products, and consumers who buy and consume
    these products. Managing information across all these actors in a transparent
    and tamper-proof way is the most important element in this use case. The common
    outcome of this use case is that the consumers can trust the quality of the products
    and buy these products so that each actor in the supply chain makes profits, and
    this can be enabled with IoT and blockchain technology. This is the main reason
    why Blockchain has become an integral part of the IoT Standards Reference Model.

    store and buy some fruits, as a consumer how do we currently determine the quality
    of the product? We just based our quality assumption on the trust we have on Walmart.
    We do not know who has produced the fruit and how much chemicals have been used
    during farming, whether the fruits have been transported using the right temperatures
    and within a certain timeframe, and where the fruits have been packed, tested,
    and processed. With blockchain and IoT, the entire sequence of steps from farm
    to fork can be made transparent to the customer without depending on any intermediaries,
    and therefore this can be considered a great technology to explore.

    that is getting into the blockchain is accurate and trusted. As long as there
    are humans that are sending information, such as the temperature in which a product
    is stored, data can be tampered. If it is coming from a tamper-proof endpoint,
    such as an IoT device sending the temperature information on a periodic basis
    to the blockchain, it adds much more trust to the blockchain-based traceability
    solution. This is one of the examples where IoT contributes tremendous value to
    blockchain-based solutions.

    starting from procuring raw materials to drug manufacturing till transporting
    and handing over the drug to the customer can be recorded using blockchain using
    a tamper-proof tag, the counterfeit issue can be addressed. With blockchain, besides
    traceability there is added trust since none of the transactions can be changed
    in the blockchain world.

    upgrade where hackers try to gain entry into the car systems posing as genuine
    actors and take control of the systems. If such a coordination of software upgrades
    can be mediated through a blockchain, enterprises can ensure that the right actors
    who have the right permissions are the only ones who are able to send the transaction
    to the car systems apart from making sure that software that is sent is signed
    and is not tampered. Such an approach begins to see blockchain adding value to
    an IoT-based solution.

    in an end-to-end transaction for any enterprise is that there are a variety of
    actors and enterprises with different interests that need to subscribe to the
    same blockchain model to complete a transaction, and it is not always mandatory
    that all of them will do so. If not all parties subscribe to the model from an
    industry perspective, enterprises will not get the full value of applying the
    technology. So it is really important that the manufacturers and the transportation
    companies and the retailers and the delivery companies subscribe to the model.

    transaction, it is essential to understand who owns the data, who owns the business
    logic that runs on the blockchain, who can add new services on top of the existing
    blockchain, and who will decide who can join the network and who can leave the
    network. This brings in the most important element of blockchain governance which
    needs to be addressed while the blockchain solution is implemented in an IoT Standards

    agriculture farmers. These are the folks who produce food, control the oil and
    gas process, pump oil from the ground, or are folks who are responsible for maintaining
    the fleet of the company trucks. An OT department is measured on entirely different
    success criteria, such as what is the yield of the crop, how much water is being

    Analytics will have to happen in real time for companies to benefit from these
    types of data. Though it is clear that IoT generates an enormous amount of data,
    this is not the main challenge. The key issue is that not many enterprises have
    a data-driven culture – what this means is that enterprises have still not created
    a mature process to manage big data in their enterprise. The challenge is not
    about the data volumes, but it is more about where do I get the data, how I stitch
    the data together to make meaningful insights, how do I manage and maintain this
    data, and how do I do this in the most appropriate way. Chapter [11](517610_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml)

    need to understand that there is no single architecture that they can use as a

    based on who they are (i.e., the industry they are in), what they do (i.e., manufacture

    In such a simplified context, the Gateway functions as a “broker.” In this context,
    the Gateway either directly connects to IoT field equipment (sensors, actuators,
    etc.) or through programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or supervisory control
    and data acquisition systems (SCADA) which aggregate field data. These Gateways
    support a wide variety of I/O interfaces, including wired and wireless connections.

    live by 2020, a traditional Gateway has a lot of challenges because if all data
    needs to be sent from IoT devices to the cloud or data center, we are talking
    about a significant amount of data per second which in some use cases can range
    from a few terabytes to even petabytes of data transfer per minute. There is an
    enormous amount of raw data that IoT devices generate, and if this data is directly
    sent from IoT Gateways to the cloud, it introduces a lot of inefficiencies because
    data transfer from a device to the cloud causes latency and high costs and also
    can many times clog the network connectivity apart from inducing data privacy
    issues in some cases. So though Gateways are built to connect the unconnected,
    the other main task Gateways are expected to perform is to start the analytics
    process at the Gateway level. This is where edge computing has disrupted the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Edge computing is a distributed computing model that brings computation and
    data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times
    and save bandwidth. In edge computing, critical data processing occurs at the
    data source rather than in a centralized cloud-based location. Edge computing
    resolves the challenge of inefficient data transfer architecture by performing
    important tasks at the IoT Gateway itself. Gateways built using edge computing
    techniques are called Smart IoT Gateways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in essence on the OT side as we speak more about Smart IoT Gateways, it is
    really about managing millions of devices as easily as managing one thing apart
    from consuming all data from the devices, deriving insights, and then performing
    actions based on the insights. With Smart IoT Gateways, it is all about managing
    perishable data at the edge and only moving to the IoT Cloud platform data what
    is actually needed to store from a long-term perspective or to perform analytics
    on a very specialized data.

    in healthcare, and in such use cases, people’s lives, safety, and high finances
    are at stake. These are examples where enterprises look at almost near to zero
    latency, and therefore there is no appetite to pass all the data back to the cloud
    for processing. Enterprises need to process data right at the source as quickly
    as possible by using Smart IoT Gateways. Smart IoT Gateways should be capable
    of giving the same type of high power and performance and low latency that we
    would traditionally expect from IoT Platforms in the cloud or a data center.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart IoT Gateways should be able to perform the tasks to manage OT from the
    outside and IT from the inside. What this means is that there are different types
    of devices that enterprises deal with in an IoT use case, and every industry uses
    different devices. Devices used in building management are very different from
    those used in an automotive industry or in a pharmaceutical setting. These devices
    use multiple protocols and inputs/outputs, and they are going to be there with
    us for the next many years. It is essential that IoT solutions coexist with these
    devices and protocols. What this means is that Smart IoT Gateways should be capable
    of supporting and communicating with the magnitude of such OT devices so that
    enterprises can retrieve all data from these devices – so the first feature expected
    from Smart IoT Gateways is the ability to have the right connectivity to be able
    to connect and communicate with any type of device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second aspect is that these Smart IoT Gateways are not going to sit in the
    data centers or under desks or home environment. These are devices which will
    need to be very rugged as they may have to sit in windmills or boiler rooms under
    high temperatures, which are not a very easy environment to be, and at the same
    time, they have to last a long time and have to operate efficiently under these
    conditions. Often, Gateways become a mission-critical piece of an IoT architecture
    since most enterprises using IoT will depend on the devices to predict the future,
    so any downtime with these Gateways can lead to a business problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in summary, when enterprises are shortlisting IoT Gateways, they need to
    first look at the protocols Gateways support based on the devices they have within
    their enterprise. IoT Gateways should be capable of connecting with multiple types
    of devices (including legacy) within the enterprise setting, and secondly they
    need to be robust enough such that enterprises can deploy these IoT Gateways in
    tough and rough environments, such as at locations with high temperatures or dust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some IoT use cases need Gateways to connect to the devices continuously apart
    from being able to make time-sensitive and real-time decisions based on data received
    from these devices. In such case, introducing latency is not an option, which
    typically is caused when data moves back and forth to the cloud. This means that
    IoT Gateways should be capable of performing analytics and real-time decisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    healthcare, pharma, banking, and financial services, are regulated, and for all
    such enterprises, it is essential that data is kept on-site, and hence IoT Gateways
    should have the capability to store data.

    and in some cases there may be over ten thousand sensors at one location, and
    each sensor takes and transmits hundreds of readings per second. Analyzing the
    data volumes is an important step in the Gateway selection process. Secondly,
    many Gateway vendors have a limit to the number of devices that can be loaded
    on an IoT Gateway, and installing multiple IoT Gateways to achieve the scale may
    not be the wisest solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Industrial Gateways deployed in factories usually collect multiple sensor readings
    every second. However, situations such as network failures may arise, and as a
    result the Gateway will need to store this data locally while the network issues
    are being remedied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but a Gateway installed in the typical industrial setting needs to be able to
    store a significant amount of data and for longer periods of time. It is advisable
    therefore to choose a Gateway that allows for expansion of storage.

    process data that is collected from the sensors or IoT devices. Many traditional
    Gateway manufacturers have developed their Gateways with zero processing or data
    storage capability at the Gateway, which means that all data need to be sent to
    the data centers or cloud for processing. Now with the new demands from IoT use
    cases, data processing at the edge is a mandate, and hence Smart IoT Gateways
    become the norm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most IoT solutions, not all the data from the sensors is required to be sent
    to the cloud for processing. It is required that a Gateway performs some preprocessing
    operations on the data obtained from the sensors before it sends the data to the
    cloud either for large-scale analytical processing or for data storage.

    environment, storage, computing power, security, development tools, and many other
    common functions. Platforms abstract a lot of common functions away from the specific
    application logic. For example, regardless of whether you are trying to write
    an application to optimize fuel consumption or a classroom space, a lot of the
    underlying technology needs are essentially the same. Enterprises just need to
    focus on the specific problem they are solving and use common capabilities for

    to do business. Reliability is the probability of a system or a component (hosted
    in the cloud) for performing the required functions in a period of time without
    failure. Availability is the time the platform provider guarantees that data and
    services are available in a given period of time.

    a cloud platform is of utmost importance for any enterprise that wants to use
    the cloud to perform their business since downtimes will have a direct impact
    on the business.

    look for providers who not only agree on SLA for high availability and reliability
    but have also consistently delivered to these SLAs in the last several years.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a perfect world, systems should be 100% reliable and available, but that
    is probably not an attainable goal. Many cloud providers have an SLA of 99.99%
    reliability target. Availability is typically documented as a percent of time
    per year, for example, 99.999% uptime means enterprises will be unable to access
    resources for no more than about five minutes per year.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second most important element that influences the choice of a cloud provider
    is scalability. Cloud scalability refers to how well systems can react and adapt
    to changing demands. As enterprises grow, they want to be able to seamlessly add
    resources without losing quality of service or interruptions. As the demand for
    resources decreases, enterprises want to be able to quickly and efficiently downscale
    systems so that they need not have to pay for resources they do not need. A resource
    means an operating system, an application, a specific hardware, tools, or devices.

    to add and remove resources on demand. Elasticity is important because enterprises
    want to ensure that their clients and employees have access to the right number
    of resources they needed and they are paying for what they are using. Cloud elasticity
    should be automatic and seamless. People accessing cloud services should not be
    able to notice that resources are added or dropped. They should just have the
    confidence that they can access and use resources without interruptions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vertical scaling (or “scaling up”)  refers to upgrading a single resource. For
    example, installing more memory or storage capacity to an existing server. In
    a physical, on-premises setup, enterprises would need to shut down the server
    to install the updates, but in the cloud world, this can be accomplished without
    bringing the servers down.

    For example, enterprises can add processing power or more memory to a server by
    linking it with other servers. Horizontal scaling is a necessary capability to
    validate while choosing a cloud provider. Enterprises should be able to add additional
    hardware or software resources with minimal impact to provide redundancy and ensure
    that services remain reliable and available.

    manage the different types of scalability in the cloud. Cloud providers, such
    as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, offer autoscaling to
    enable consistent performance regardless of the current demand on resources, and
    it is another key element to be validated while choosing a cloud platform.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third basic feature that determines the platform choice is the ability of
    the cloud provider to react during a disaster. Disaster recovery (DR)  is an area
    of security planning that aims to protect an organization from the effects of
    significant negative and unexpected events such as floods, fire, and other natural
    calamities. Having a disaster recovery in place enables an organization to maintain
    or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption. Disaster
    recovery in cloud computing means storing critical data and applications in cloud
    storage and failing over to a secondary site in case of a disaster. Disaster recovery
    is a very key feature which needs to be factored while choosing a cloud provider.
    Enterprises need to understand the provider disaster recovery provisions, processes,
    and their ability to support data preservation expectations (including recovery
    time objectives).

    while choosing an IoT Platform. Cloud data protection is the practice of securing
    enterprise data in a cloud environment, wherever that data is located, whether
    it is at rest or in motion, and whether it is managed internally by the company
    or externally by a third party. Enterprises need to make sure that the provider
    they choose meets the strict security standards based on their regional and industry
    needs. Enterprises need to verify if cloud providers are compliant with basic
    standards like the ISO 27000 series and if their certifications are valid. Enterprises
    also need to look at platform providers’ compliance with data protection and privacy
    laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR,
    in the EU; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or
    HIPAA, in the United States; and others.

    during a platform selection. Cloud security consists of a set of policies, controls,
    procedures, and technologies that work together to protect cloud-based systems,
    data, and infrastructure. From authenticating access to filtering traffic, platform
    providers need to have cloud security that can be configured to the exact needs
    of the business.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the benefits of the cloud is that enterprises pay for the services and
    resources they use. Rather than being presented with a flat fee, cloud providers
    operate on a pay-as-you-use pricing model. Each cloud service provider has a unique
    bundle of services and pricing models. Different providers have unique price advantages
    for different products. Typically, pricing variables are based on the period of
    usage with some providers allowing for by-the-minute usage as well as discounts
    for longer commitments.

    or “resource sets” consumption. Aside from financial competitiveness, enterprises
    need to look for flexibility in terms of resource variables but also in terms
    of speed to provision and deprovision. An application architecture that allows
    enterprises to scale different elements independently means one can use cloud
    resources more efficiently.

    six features, enterprises can filter their IoT Platform providers to less than
    ten. Though this is the good first milestone achieved, it is quite essential to
    understand that the most important step for any enterprise to succeed in IoT is
    to choose a platform based on the provider specialization and capabilities in
    IoT. An IoT Platform should have enough breadth and depth of capabilities specific
    to IoT solutions, based on the enterprise business and use cases. If this step
    goes wrong, enterprises risk themselves toward failed IoT projects.

    It is essential to identify the kinds of problems an enterprise is trying to solve
    using IoT, get a short list of likely solutions and use cases, and try to determine
    where you will need specialization and depth. If enterprises have an idea of what
    kind of business problem they are solving and where the biggest challenges are,
    you will be able to quickly come to a short list of platforms.

    30 minutes per device. Imagine a factory installing 10,000 smart light bulbs,
    all of which needs to be onboarded on an IoT platform. Effectively, this means
    that in a manual way an enterprise will need to spend 300,000 person hours to
    complete the installation. The key demand of many enterprises today is to reduce
    the onboard time for IoT devices on the platform. In an Industrial IoT case study,
    an enterprise has tens of thousands of devices to onboard, and in such a large
    setting, manual processes lead to significant costs and efforts. While choosing
    an IoT Platform, enterprises need to look for IoT platforms which can bring down
    installation time and get IoT devices online faster and in a secured and automated
    way. There are IoT platforms available in the market which have created a zero-touch
    approach, making it possible for IoT devices to dynamically discover the IoT platform

    IoT Platforms to have solutions that can store the right data in the right way
    is essential. In an IoT architecture, there are thousands of sensors collecting
    huge volumes of both structured and unstructured data, such as temperature reading
    as well as video and audio footage. Almost all IoT Platforms use data lakes to
    store this raw data. The benefits of data lakes are that they can grow indefinitely,
    integrate with many processing and analytics tools, and provide a relatively low
    cost of storage. However, to enable analytics on IoT data, organizations need
    to plan their storage carefully. Just dumping data into a data lake with no prior
    treatment can create a data swamp. Enterprises need to ensure that they save only
    the required data to a data lake, and secondly data should be stored in a format
    that enables analysis without the need to perform heavy corrections on the data.
    The IoT Platform should be able to support such a need.

    latency, and data privacy. There may be some data storage and analytics processes
    that need to happen at Smart Gateways and the rest in the cloud or vice versa.

    unit, car manufacturing unit, oil refining, or chemical development, OT systems
    generate money for enterprises. All focus has therefore traditionally been placed
    on making sure that the OT systems that produce the end products have been designed
    in a way that they are very safe, highly efficient, and productive with “long-lived
    missions.” A long-lived mission means that an OT system of critical infrastructure
    is expected to run 24/7 and 365 days a year for several decades. Due to such a
    need, major patching or upgrading cycles do not happen for years, and therefore
    the types of vulnerabilities that exist live a very long time in those systems.

    every time there is a new bug, the manufacturer pushes a patch to address it.
    It is a reactive approach, as with every new attack, enterprises respond with
    forensic investigations that ultimately lead to patching and ongoing monitoring
    to stop the problem from reappearing. However, such an approach is not possible
    in the OT world. A small incident can not only cause the plant to shut down leading
    to millions of dollars losses, but there is also the chance of human losses and
    accidents due to cyber-attacks. On the other hand, there are trade secrets such
    as recipes that are often loaded on the OT control systems that need to be protected.

    side of the house. Wireless systems were making it possible to gather information
    to reduce operational costs, thereby achieving operational efficiency. During
    this time, security in OT systems took a backseat, and after some time the industry
    saw cyber-attacks on smart meters. As an example, some smart meter settings were
    changed by individuals so that meter readings did not go up, by placing large-sized
    magnets on the meters. This was the evolution of IoT where cyber security was
    thought of as a secondary requirement, and because of this some utility providers

    nearly 40% of enterprises believe that being isolated from external threats is
    a solution to being secure, and therefore they tend to be disconnected from the
    outside world. These enterprises consider isolation as a strategy to protect themselves
    against cyber risks and therefore have never been able to take advantage of the
    technology existing in the market. These are the ones who are at risk of losing

    these are the ones that are in the regulated industries and have a compliance
    aspect in their mandate. They enhance their cyber security posture to simply meet

    or critical infrastructure are very similar to IT. There are workstations, standard
    software stacks, or standard applications, but as we reach deeper into the OT
    system, there are different kinds of technology stacks, embedded equipment such
    as real-time operating systems, and industrial proprietary protocols that are
    used to connect these systems together. Cyber security experts need to understand
    the differences in the technology and the differences in the vulnerabilities that

    technology. This means that enterprises need to look at technologies that are

    systems that will be part of IoT implementations. Cyber experts need to look at
    the specific nature of the risk at each layer of the OT system and make sure that
    the protective measure that will be employed inside that system is going to support
    each particular mission. They will need to deeply understand the protocols that
    are used to connect these systems together, speed of data, and information transferred
    and not introduce any unintended latency or jitter as such inefficiencies can
    bring the OT systems down. As an example, the patching cycles often tend to be
    more rapid on the IT side than they are on the OT side of the house. Many OT systems
    may take years or months to put a patch or protection in place simply because
    of the operational mission of the particular OT system. From a purpose-built technology
    perspective, the main difference we see here is that there is a whole host of
    standardized protocols on the IT side. In the OT side, there are a lot of pieces
    of equipment that have been built around proprietary technology and proprietary
    protocols which glue the OT systems together and connect them to allow machine-to-machine
    interaction. The protective measures that are employed in an IT world are often
    based on standardized protocols, whereas on the OT side, we will get into all
    kinds of esoteric and proprietary protocols that are the systems used to communicate
    with each other. It is essential for enterprises to utilize security technologies
    and platforms that are built purposefully for all such OT systems.'

- en: Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to
    confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or
    corrupted since it was signed. Runtime Self-Protection (RSP) is a security solution
    designed to provide personalized protection to applications running on the devices.
    It takes advantage of the insight into an application’s internal data and state
    to enable it to identify threats at runtime that may have otherwise been overlooked
    by other security solutions. Code signing cryptographically ensures code has not
    been tampered after being “signed” as safe for the device. All critical devices,
    whether a sensor or a hub, should be configured to only run signed code and never
    run unsigned code. Still, devices must be protected long after code begins running.
    Host-based protections help here. A host-based security is a piece of firewall
    software that runs on an individual computer or device connected to a network.
    These types of firewalls are a granular way to protect the individual hosts from
    viruses and malware and to control the spread of these harmful infections throughout
    the network.

    to the Internet. It is essential for enterprises to protect the integrity of data
    being sent from IoT devices to Smart IoT Gateways to the IoT Cloud Platform or
    back-end systems and ensure only authorized devices and applications communicate
    with APIs.

    track data leaks. Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets
    passing through a given network.

    their API can be called and track its use over history. More calls on an API may
    indicate that it is being abused. It could also be a programming mistake, such
    as calling the API in an endless loop. Enterprises need to make rules for throttling
    to protect APIs from spikes and denial-of-service attacks.

- en: IoT Gateways  are a solution to enable communication with devices irrespective
    of their protocols and also act as security agents for resource-constrained IoT
    devices, sensors, and actuators that lack the CPU horsepower, battery life, and
    storage to handle complex cryptographic security functions, such as secured access
    authentication and encryption. However, in an IoT environment, not only the devices
    but the Gateway itself is prone to various security threats since Gateways are
    exposed to the Internet. If the Gateway is not secured, all accompanying security
    technologies would become useless if the Gateways are compromised. Enterprises
    need to ensure that they deploy Smart IoT Gateways, which have foolproof security
    controls, and at a minimum the Gateways have endpoint security controls such as
    identity and access control, over-the-air updates, and threat detection feature.

    can participate in data exchange. A Gateway should be designed as a trust anchor
    and equipped with key-based access control to grant access to authorized users
    and devices. To protect the secrets (keys and certificates), secured storage should
    be implemented.

    could be constrained, it is more practical to automate threat detection by using
    machine learning or Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning enables enterprises
    to identify behavioral baselines and detect or even prevent anomalies, and such
    features should be validated before choosing an IoT Gateway.

    for making a business impact rather than from a cyber security angle. However,
    Blockchain does offer an intriguing solution for IoT security as well. Blockchain
    contains strong protections against data tampering, locking access to Internet
    of Things devices, and allowing compromised devices in an IoT network to be shut
    down. However, IoT-blockchain technology is now in its initial stages, and a few
    major technology companies have begun to seek opportunities in this space. For
    example, the IBM Blockchain Platform allows enterprises to extend blockchain into
    cognitive IoT, a set of technologies that combines IoT and cognitive computing.

    concerns and operational challenges. Scalability and storage are major issues
    in blockchain systems that maintain a large centralized ledger, and storing the
    ledger on edge nodes is considered inefficient since devices are not yet capable
    of storing large volumes of data or handling relatively large amounts of computational
    power. These factors are some of the challenges for shifting IoT networks onto
    blockchain platforms.

    in the coming years. The implementation of standard security rules and regulations
    will encourage the adoption of IoT-blockchain technology. By introducing new standards
    of data privacy and peer-to-peer communication, blockchain can add a new degree
    of security to the Internet-enabled devices. Peer-to-peer communication refers
    to the transmission between two peer devices or systems over a network.

    Smart IoT Gateways and the IoT Cloud Platform or back-end systems and ensure only
    authorized devices and applications communicate with APIs. Using a standard secured
    API Gateway is one of the best ways to secure APIs. The last aspect we discussed
