- en: In general terms, a cryptocurrency is a system of creating, maintaining and
    managing virtual or digital money represented in the form of tokens or digital
    coins. Certain cryptocurrencies have also established their presence in the physical
    world by implementing access to credit cards and other material products. However,
    the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrencies remain imperceptible and are entirely
    represented as sequences of binary digits in the virtual space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The root “crypto” in the term “cryptocurrencies” refers to sophisticated cryptographic
    techniques allowing the creation and management of digital currencies and their
    transactions. Apart from the use of cryptography, another crucial ingredient of
    all cryptocurrencies lies in their adherence to decentralization. Typically, all
    cryptocurrencies are developed as open-source software by highly qualified teams
    of cryptographers building mechanisms to ensure security and efficient operation
    of the cryptosystems.

    in attempts to create a comprehensive list of all cryptocurrencies in the current

    many of them also vanish every year. For example, more than 4000 cryptocurrencies
    existed in 2021\. Many of them attracted negligible participation, and quite a
    few of them did enjoy immense popularity among dedicated investors and their followers.

    software to manage a global network for payments that is not controlled by any
    central authorities. The main advantages of Litecoin in comparison to Bitcoin
    are a faster block generation rate and the use of Scrypt as a proof-of-work scheme,
    where data can be decrypted by applying consumer-level CPUs.

    by other network participants. Litecoin was founded with the goal of prioritizing
    transaction speed, and that has proven an advantage as it has grown in popularity.'

    confirmation time (the time it takes for a block to be verified and added to the
    blockchain) is currently just under 9 min per transaction, though this can vary
    widely when traffic is high (“Bitcoin Stats”, March 10, 2021). The equivalent
    figure for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 min (Litecoin Wiki, “Litecoin”, March 10, 2021).
  prefs: []

    Bitcoin and Litecoin lies in the different cryptographic algorithms being applied.
    Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 as a part of its consensus procedure, while Litecoin

    Then, much faster high-powered specialized machines were designed specifically
    for mining Bitcoin. They increased the speed of mining significantly, led to severe
    competition and power consumption. Only professional miners were able to compete
    in such environment. People did not agree that cryptomining should be restricted
    only to a select group of well-funded professionals. Energy consumption of the
    Bitcoin network also caused serious environmental concerns. The Litecoin proof-of-work
    system Scrypt was intended to solve both of these problems.

    SHA-256 is a more complex algorithm than Scrypt, while at the same time allowing
    a greater degree of parallel processing. This parallelization allowed Bitcoin
    miners to create Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which were
    tailored for mining Bitcoins and can seriously outperform ordinary computers (Bitcoin
    Wiki, “ASIC”, 10 March 2021) Hence, the Bitcoin mining has become a professional
    activity unreachable for the everyday users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By contrast, Scrypt is much less amenable to parallelization and cannot be handled
    by customized hardware of ASIC mining. Therefore, Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies
    such as Litecoin are more accessible to users wishing to participate in the mining.
    Even though some companies have designed Scrypt ASICs, nevertheless Litecoin’s
    mining still remains more easily accessible for the general community of users
    and a large proportion of Litecoin mining is still being performed by the standard
    CPUs or GPUs (Litecoin Wiki, “Mining Hardware Comparison”, 10 March 2021).

    the total number of coins that these cryptocurrencies can produce. The Bitcoin
    network can never exceed 21 million coins, whereas Litecoin can accommodate up to
    84 million coins. In practice, the real-world effects of this difference may turn
    out negligible, because both Bitcoin and Litecoin can be divided into very small
    quantities. The minimum transferable piece of a Bitcoin is one hundred millionth
    (0.00000001) of Bitcoin known colloquially as one “Satoshi” (Bitcoin Wiki, “Satoshi
    (Unit)”, 10 March 2021). Therefore, it should always remain easy for the users

    development. The division of work between the two layers allows Algorand to process
    transactions efficiently. The operation of more complex smart contracts occurs
    off-chain. Therefore, simple transactions can be handled much faster in the first

    offering authentic value to the efforts of building a borderless economy. Algorand’s
    technology of decentralized, secure, scalable, and distributed ledger is aimed
    to serve as the bridge with companies and organizations seeking access to broad
    markets. After the launch of the Algorand’s Main Net, it was reported that the
    network was capable of processing 1000 transactions per second, which is a significant
    advance towards the performance levels of payment networks such as VISA, which
    can manage to process approximately 1700 transactions per second.

    contribution. This makes Algorand suitable for most applications in the financial
    sector. The Pure PoS was developed by Silvio Micali. It reduces energy use significantly.
    Besides, it can finalize transaction in just a few seconds. All users can influence
    the choice of the next block according to the sizes of their stakes, i.e. their
    number of the ALGO tokens. Random selection of leaders for proposing new blocks
    and for voting on the block proposals. The likelihood of being chosen is proportional
    to the number of ALGO tokens in the stake.

- en: The Algorand cryptocurrency is called ALGO. The rewards for producing blocks
    are split and distributed among all ALGO coin holders, rather than being awarded
    only to block validators. All ALGO coin holders were able to earn approximately
    7.5% annual percentage reward in 2021\. This encourages the users to join the
    Algorand network accelerating decentralization [[10](#CR10)].

    themselves. It suffices to own ALGO in a wallet or on an exchange to earn rewards.

    use PoW consensus. Algorand’s PPoS has significant advantages over PoW.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, PoW is very expensive and consumes a lot of energy. Mining requires special
    hardware to be competitive. Only professional miners can obtain profit. Therefore,
    block creation in PoW system is restricted to a select group of professionals.
    Algorand’s PPoS is available for all nodes to take part. Every user possessing
    stake can contribute to the consensus process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, PoW leads to a centralization as a result of miners creating large teams
    pooling the resources of their equipment. These mining pools can outperform other
    participants and monopolize the system. For example, Bitcoin is now currently
    controlled by three mining pools and Ethereum is controlled by just two. On the
    other hand, Algorand’s PPoS does not create any advantage for malicious users
    trying to split their stake into many accounts or by pooling resources into a
    single one. The only way to increase the influence in Algorand is to increase
    the stake of the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, in PoW consensus the users have to wait until the computational puzzles
    are solved before their block can be added. This make PoW algorithms slow, which
    may prevent various applications. In Algorand, blocks are created immediately,
    so that the algorithm scales up to millions of users maintaining a high transaction
    rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, with PoW, there is a chance that two users could solve for a valid
    block at the same time creating forks. Forks create uncertainty and require waiting
    time until the finality of the block is established. In contrast, Algorand never
    creates forks. Only one block can be chosen by the Algorand’s votes of the corresponding
    committee. As a result, all transactions are final in Algorand.

    DPoS limits the number of block producers and can operate much faster than PoW.
    However, this may create risks to decentralization and security. In contrast,
    PPoS doesn’t delegate block creating to small sets of nodes, which the attackers
    can target. This strengthens security.'

    The weight of their vote is proportional to the value of their bond. The bond
    is locked until an indicated period has elapsed. Dishonest users forfeit their
    bonds and lose their rights to contribute to the consensus decisions. The drawback
    is that holding coins in bonds reduces spending abilities of the users.'
