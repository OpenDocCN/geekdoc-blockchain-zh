    blockchain: distribution, immutability, and encryption. Organizations are using
    these solutions to improve record keeping and transparency and to modernize cumbersome
    or manual processes, including those that cross enterprise boundaries. Through
    2023, the majority of solutions inside established organizations and called “blockchain”
    will be blockchain-inspired and developed for one of these purposes.'

    improve efficiency; reduce back-office costs; speed up confirmation, settlement,
    and traceability; and improve data quality and management.[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en1)
    An example of a high-potential solution that fits these criteria is currently
    in development at the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to replace its twenty-five-year-old
    Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS), a computer system that records
    shareholdings, manages share transactions, and facilitates the exchange of title
    or ownership when people sell financial products for money. Today, CHESS handles
    as many as two million trades per day.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en2) The system
    is a true workhorse, but twenty-five years is a long time in the world of technology.
    Dan Chesterman, CIO of ASX, explained that he concluded in 2015 that the exchange
    had reached the natural limit of what it could do to improve CHESS’s capability
    and efficiency.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en3)
  prefs: []

    challenges pressing on the ASX. CHESS runs a proprietary messaging protocol, which
    makes it difficult for the ASX to attract listings from the AsiaPac and the Middle
    East. The Australian government also opened competition in clearing and settlement
    of equity trades.[⁴](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en4) ASX does not have a credible
    competitor in Australia, but technological advancement could change that. For
    those reasons, the organization will need a new system to maintain its status
    in Australia and be a viable global partner beyond the continent. In 2016, ASX
    presented its roadmap to replace CHESS with a “distributed ledger technology”
    (DLT) solution—in other words, CHESS as a permissioned blockchain.[⁵](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en5)
    However, the roadmap also stipulated that ASX will build an ISO20022 messaging
    option for ecosystem participants that don’t want to use the DLT capability. With
    this announcement, ASX established itself as one of the first national securities
    exchanges hoping to use blockchain technology for its mission-critical financial
    settlement systems.

    revolutionizing the Australian markets and others. There are risks, however. We

    on the full promise we see for the real business of blockchain. Still, these solutions
    are not without value. For the right application in the right context, they could
    enable improvements in document management, traceability, and fraud prevention
    and create other efficiencies. Using a taxonomy of blockchain-inspired archetypes,
    we discuss ways to distinguish the high-benefit solutions from those with low
    benefit. But before we describe the archetypes, let’s revisit the matter of centralization
    in blockchain-inspired solutions and how it affects the four business currencies
    (data, access, contracts, and technology) that form the core of the blockchain-inspired
    benefit-risk calculation.

- en: To recap, the four business currencies are major sources of value and competitive
    advantage in digital, not just blockchain, environments. In the simplest interactions,
    users “pay” for free access to software or a digital solution with the details
    they reveal about their interests and habits; the digital platforms in turn use
    this data to attract advertisers, develop new products and features, and increasingly
    steer customers to take certain actions. The lack of an explicit and multilateral
    contract between the user and the digital platform provider means there is no
    limit to how much data the provider can collect or how often it uses the data
    and in what situations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All centralized digital platforms exert control over the data that runs through
    them. This means that blockchain-inspired solutions exert centralized control
    over data just as digital platform do. Furthermore, because blockchain-inspired
    solutions are not designed to be decentralized, they instead operate with some
    level of central coordination and governance of the network. Centralization is
    achieved by including aspects of database management mechanisms as part of the
    information architecture; the database mechanisms determine which entity acts
    as a transaction authenticator and validator and therefore decides what gets written
    to the ledger. Although, as we explained earlier, a blockchain is not a database
    and lacks a central authority, blockchain-inspired strategies blur those distinctions.
    Some would argue that a “centralized blockchain” is a contradiction in terms and
    that a blockchain that includes a database is not a blockchain at all. Ignoring
    these semantic arguments, we call these solutions that exploit database technology
    *blockchain-inspired*.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en6)
  prefs: []

- en: Most important, a centralized solution has a single authority and does not use
    a decentralized consensus algorithm to validate the identity of participants and
    authenticate the transactions. Also, a centralized architecture with a single
    authority creates a single point of failure for the network. Put simply, all the
    promises you hear about blockchain as more secure and reliable than traditional
    data architectures are not true *if the design is centralized*. Security is not
    the only consideration, either. Without tokenization and decentralized consensus,
    a blockchain-inspired solution cannot enable participants who do not know each
    other to exchange value without a third party validating the exchange.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ownership over a blockchain solution becomes a major issue with solutions under
    central control. With decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin, there is no owner
    and access is open to anyone (pseudonymously) who wants to participate and has
    the infrastructure to do so. Blockchain-inspired solutions, in contrast, usually
    have one owner or a limited group of owners, and membership is restricted to the
    parties invited by the owner to participate. For that reason, blockchain-inspired
    solutions are also referred to as *closed, private* or *permissioned* blockchain
    networks.

    Any given blockchain-inspired solution will capture a smaller band of territory
    in relation to the degrees of digitalization and decentralization. Some blockchain
    solutions, such as ASX and its CHESS replacement, provide a highly controlled
    and centrally operated and governed solution to a market problem. The rationale
    for this choice is sound. As Chesterman explained during an on-stage conversation
    at Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo October 2018 in Australia, “We aren’t solving a trust
    problem. People do inherently trust the ASX to be the source of truth for the
    data that is in CHESS. We’re solving a data synchronicity problem.”

    may aim to exert control over others in the value chain. Eventually some solutions
    hope to evolve toward decentralized collaboration over time. The distinction can
    often be seen in how a solution trades in the four business currencies. Let’s

    it is most vulnerable during the blockchain-inspired phase.[⁷](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en7)
    This vulnerability is especially apparent with blockchain-inspired solutions designed
    to facilitate interorganizational interactions in a value chain. If your organization
    participates in one of these blockchains, and the governance of that blockchain
    allows a single actor or subgroup to access or control all the data that flows
    through it, then you may be exposing your business information without receiving
    commensurate insight or value in return.

    CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said, “but it will require a governance that makes it an

    weakness we’re currently seeing in many of these initiatives, as each individual

    The concerns are exacerbated for information-intensive solutions. When blockchain-inspired
    solutions allow a single large company with superior AI analytical capability
    to view and access the data and influence the flows from every party in the system,
    the benefits could accrue disproportionately to that actor, with the disparities
    multiplying over time. The lack of tokens in blockchain-inspired solutions reinforces
    the centralization of power, since there is no mechanism to allow participants
    to control their information, provide consent, or trade it as an asset.

    solutions. Any participant or node can join a blockchain peer-to-peer network.
    The blockchain design in fact favors participation because decentralized consensus-based
    decision making gets stronger and more trustworthy when more nodes are involved.
    Access and participation define the ethos, grounded in the idea that transparency
    drives adherence to the rules. The concept is similar to eBay’s early use of member
    reviews to allow people to call out bidders or sellers who didn’t honor the terms
    of an auction. Make it open, transparent, and accountable, and everyone will play

    Open access is a challenging concept for many leaders used to seeing boundaries

    familiar and comfortable and can be applied today within their organization.

    solutions trade on scarcity rather than availability. Solution creators make these
    forms of blockchain useful so that “customers” and “partners” see short-term benefits.
    But this “value” could be coerced in the right circumstances. For instance, a
    major customer or channel partner could make participation in its centrally controlled
    blockchain a condition of ongoing partnership. In these situations, access to
    the blockchain solution will be synonymous with access to the market. If you refuse,
    you lose the ability to connect with your end customer.

    In contrast, if decisions are community based and the smart contracts and their
    maintenance are transparent, they could serve as equalizing forces that keep the
    rules and their consequences visible. You therefore need to understand the source
    of the smart contracts, who is in charge of the maintenance of the related code,
    and who bears the liability in the event of an error. Smart contracts and the
    rules they execute should never be regarded as a technical issue. It’s a business
    issue, as control of the contract gives control over the value produced and exchanged
    by the blockchain.

    to increase quality, reorient production, and lower costs so the platform owner
    can attract more customers, which encourages still greater polarization of volume.
    Customers benefit at first in the form of greater convenience, improved products,
    and lower costs. Eventually, however, the consolidation of power in the market
    decreases competition, which risks making the supply less reliable, less diverse,
    less influenced by customer choice, and more expensive. Put directly, Trojan Horse

    trades is down. With the mainframe due for an upgrade and the size of the market
    decreasing, we found the cost to be too high. So we came together with technology
    providers, experts, and our clients, and decided TIW represented a good opportunity
    to do something significant and impactful with blockchain.” The company is currently

    of a solution with evolutionary potential. In much of the developed world, private
    citizens hold a majority of their wealth in their homes, which people may use
    as collateral to secure low-interest loans. Despite the economic relevance of
    property as an asset, buying and selling real estate is an onerous, technical
    process that is limited in form. Owners, buyers, and real estate agents trade
    copious documentation at the point of sale, sharing the paperwork with mortgage
    companies, banks, and legal entities involved in verifying ownership and reviewing
    contracts and financial arrangements. Each actor may receive, fill out, or review
    the documentation digitally, but the number of process steps and the volume of
    people who touch each transaction can stretch the process by weeks or months and
    introduce error, more so when paper is involved. Additional delays follow after
    “closing” once the paperwork goes to the government registry office, where it
    can languish for weeks before officials record the sale and issue a formal title.
    Those time lags can be costly, limiting opportunities in the real estate market,
    creating numerous parallel and inconsistent systems, and allowing fraudulent owners
    to apply for loans or make business deals on properties they don’t own.

    some are operational (the various participants in real estate transactions have
    different business cases for participation, not all of which are aligned). The
    blockchain solution might also surface cultural problems. For example, customers
    may need time before they accept a decentralized, digitalized process for exchanging
    their primary source of wealth. Financial questions, such as who pays for the
    solution and who benefits from it, must also be addressed. Finally, the Lantmäteriet
    must consider the regulatory governance of multiparty networks. What’s more, a
    group of banks and real estate companies are developing a competing online web
    portal system that could divide the market or become a better short-term solution.
    These challenges notwithstanding, promoters of the blockchain land registry assert
    that the solution could evolve into a network that connects all the actors in

    the financial system and leads to inconsistencies that cause payment delays or

    have stayed fragmented. We are all competitors, but we are also partners, and
    we have a stigma on us that we don’t trust each other. Blockchain promises a centralized
    trust factor. I think it is allowing people to say, ‘Wow if there is a place where
    all the companies could interact in real time and we all get a copy of that one
    source of truth, and we can trust that source because it’s cryptographically locked,

    A subset of consortium members participates according to rules set up by the consortium,

    are pursuing incompatible approaches, the lack of standards hurts everyone. With
    standards of practice in place, everyone uses the same technology and methods.
    The standardization encourages participants to test and use the system. With more
    participants, the consortium can iterate on the solution and improve it in faster
    cycles, adding new functionality that draws still more participants. (This same
    process could also drive increased centralization as transaction volumes polarize

    in-car navigation systems, and in-car transponders allow toll booths to register
    car data and charge the correct tolls. Those systems don’t interact with each
    other, however, and they still need a great deal of human intervention to work

    profits, what are the payout or reinvestment rules? How do the rules relate to
    the question of who pays? The multiple models that exist for allocating benefits
    vary with business and industry situation, the type and size of the firms, which
    members use the solution, and other issues. Equal allocations of cost savings
    and “profits” may be the most effective and perhaps even the most equitable approach,
    but such a distribution may not be realistic if the members’ use of the solution
    varies widely. In practice, total equity between participants is unlikely, particularly
    in groups with a large membership. In light of these complex, changing considerations,
    you should, before participating in a consortium, understand the present rules
    on benefits and the policies for adjusting them in the future. You must also recognize
    how the rules could change, especially with a Trojan horse consortium, which could
    be generous with benefits at first to attract users and to encourage lock-in.

- en: Members need general rules on communication about the consortium. Where do public
    relations and marketing materials originate, and who needs to know about them
    or sign off? If an individual member is involved in a use case, can the member
    talk about it? What information can the person share? With whom and how do they
    clear what they will talk about with the people designated to represent the consortium
    publicly? The issues to consider have to do with liability, compliance, and the
    quality controls enforced by different member organizations. While doing research
    for this book we spoke to members of consortia who did not agree 100 percent with
    what other members were saying about the organization. Such mixed messaging can
    damage the trust fabric of the consortia and can have legal and commercial ramifications
    besides. Be sure you know what the rules of communication are.

- en: Blockchain consortia often conduct tests or pilot projects, and many of these
    efforts involve third-party technology vendors or service providers. The need
    for outside expertise raises important questions about how technology will be
    selected and paid for, and how to avoid vendor bias by powerful members. How will
    the consortium share implementation lessons and best practices with all members?
    Who pays for solution integration at an individual enterprise level, and how will
    solutions accommodate existing systems and processes? What obligations do members
    have to use a consortia-developed solution? How will upgrades and other changes
    to the solution be agreed on? Which technology standards will apply? What implications
    will the technology selection have on an individual enterprise’s security policy?
    Perhaps most critically, will an individual enterprise’s technical debt increase?[^(36)](../Text/notes.html#ch3-en36)
    When consortia-built technology does not fit into the broader architecture of
    individual members, the members incur additional costs and operational issues.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consortia rules usually define how members participate, but they rarely clarify
    the exit path for members when a consortium’s goals no longer align with a member’s
    goals. Leaders need to understand both the entry and the exit rules so that they
    can decide whether the risks of potential lock-in are worth the gains of participation.

    process, and data commitment to the consortia, and what to do when the goals of
    the consortia no longer fit with your priorities. If there is no roadmap for exiting,
    consider this omission a red flag.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consortia are playing an active role in the development of blockchain-inspired
    solutions. Organizations turn to consortia to consolidate market resources and
    limit liability as they engage in early exploration of blockchain. Members of
    consortia enjoy active engagement with others in their industry, when they normally
    view any other groups as competitors. For some members, this engagement establishes
    a spirit of collaboration and enables a broader level of trust.

    of certain industries, countries, and technology platforms. Powerful firms with
    vested interests in protecting centralized operations and value chains will establish
    consortia to achieve market dominance and to promote Trojan horse solutions that
    lock in the participants.

- en: 'Consorting with the enemy requires careful consideration, depending on your
    vision for your organization and how you aim to exploit blockchain. First, make
    sure your organizational strategy regarding blockchain fits in with the intentions
    and engagement model of the consortia in your industry or geographic area. Second,
    categorize the prospective consortia by their blockchain-inspired archetypes—FOMO,
    Trojan horse, opportunistic, evolutionary, or native—and decide which types you
    are likely to explore. Third, maximize your opportunities by gaining clarity about
    nine important considerations for the relevant consortia: purpose, IP ownership,
    funding, governance, accountability, payout structure, external communications,
    technology sourcing, and exit strategy.'

    continuum. As they mature, consortia will consider how tokens and tokenization
    could improve their solutions. In the next chapter, we explore tokenization and
    how it will drive new forms of digital value and growth.
