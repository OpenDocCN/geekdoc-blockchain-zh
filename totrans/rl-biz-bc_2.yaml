    improve efficiency; reduce back-office costs; speed up confirmation, settlement,
    and traceability; and improve data quality and management.[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en1)
    An example of a high-potential solution that fits these criteria is currently
    in development at the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to replace its twenty-five-year-old
    Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS), a computer system that records
    shareholdings, manages share transactions, and facilitates the exchange of title
    or ownership when people sell financial products for money. Today, CHESS handles
    as many as two million trades per day.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en2) The system
    is a true workhorse, but twenty-five years is a long time in the world of technology.
    Dan Chesterman, CIO of ASX, explained that he concluded in 2015 that the exchange
    had reached the natural limit of what it could do to improve CHESS’s capability
    and efficiency.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en3)

  zh: 应用在正确的情境中，启发于区块链的解决方案例如能够提高效率；降低后勤成本；加快确认、结算和可追溯性；以及提高数据质量和管理。[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en1)符合这些标准的一个潜力巨大的解决方案的例子目前正在澳大利亚证券交易所（ASX）开发中，用于取代其25年历史的清算所电子登记系统（CHESS），这是一个记录股份、管理股票交易，并在人们将金融产品卖出获得金钱时促成所有权或所有权交换的计算机系统。今天，CHESS每天处理多达两百万笔交易。[²](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en2)该系统是一台真正的工作马，但在技术世界里，25年是很长的时间。ASX的首席信息官丹·切斯特曼（Dan
    Chesterman）解释说，他在2015年得出结论，认为交易所已经达到了改进CHESS能力和效率的自然极限。[³](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en3)
- en: Sticking with the status quo was not an option, given the opportunities and
    challenges pressing on the ASX. CHESS runs a proprietary messaging protocol, which
    makes it difficult for the ASX to attract listings from the AsiaPac and the Middle
    East. The Australian government also opened competition in clearing and settlement
    of equity trades.[⁴](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en4) ASX does not have a credible
    competitor in Australia, but technological advancement could change that. For
    those reasons, the organization will need a new system to maintain its status
    in Australia and be a viable global partner beyond the continent. In 2016, ASX
    presented its roadmap to replace CHESS with a “distributed ledger technology”
    (DLT) solution—in other words, CHESS as a permissioned blockchain.[⁵](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en5)
    However, the roadmap also stipulated that ASX will build an ISO20022 messaging
    option for ecosystem participants that don’t want to use the DLT capability. With
    this announcement, ASX established itself as one of the first national securities
    exchanges hoping to use blockchain technology for its mission-critical financial
    settlement systems.

    they reveal about their interests and habits; the digital platforms in turn use
    this data to attract advertisers, develop new products and features, and increasingly
    steer customers to take certain actions. The lack of an explicit and multilateral
    contract between the user and the digital platform provider means there is no

- en: All centralized digital platforms exert control over the data that runs through
    them. This means that blockchain-inspired solutions exert centralized control
    over data just as digital platform do. Furthermore, because blockchain-inspired
    solutions are not designed to be decentralized, they instead operate with some
    level of central coordination and governance of the network. Centralization is
    achieved by including aspects of database management mechanisms as part of the
    information architecture; the database mechanisms determine which entity acts
    as a transaction authenticator and validator and therefore decides what gets written
    to the ledger. Although, as we explained earlier, a blockchain is not a database
    and lacks a central authority, blockchain-inspired strategies blur those distinctions.
    Some would argue that a “centralized blockchain” is a contradiction in terms and
    that a blockchain that includes a database is not a blockchain at all. Ignoring
    these semantic arguments, we call these solutions that exploit database technology
    *blockchain-inspired*.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch2-en6)

    a decentralized consensus algorithm to validate the identity of participants and
    authenticate the transactions. Also, a centralized architecture with a single
    authority creates a single point of failure for the network. Put simply, all the
    promises you hear about blockchain as more secure and reliable than traditional
    data architectures are not true *if the design is centralized*. Security is not
    the only consideration, either. Without tokenization and decentralized consensus,
    a blockchain-inspired solution cannot enable participants who do not know each
    other to exchange value without a third party validating the exchange.

    the infrastructure to do so. Blockchain-inspired solutions, in contrast, usually
    have one owner or a limited group of owners, and membership is restricted to the
    parties invited by the owner to participate. For that reason, blockchain-inspired
    solutions are also referred to as *closed, private* or *permissioned* blockchain

    Any given blockchain-inspired solution will capture a smaller band of territory

    solutions, such as ASX and its CHESS replacement, provide a highly controlled
    and centrally operated and governed solution to a market problem. The rationale
    for this choice is sound. As Chesterman explained during an on-stage conversation
    at Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo October 2018 in Australia, “We aren’t solving a trust
    problem. People do inherently trust the ASX to be the source of truth for the
    data that is in CHESS. We’re solving a data synchronicity problem.”

    people who touch each transaction can stretch the process by weeks or months and
    introduce error, more so when paper is involved. Additional delays follow after
    “closing” once the paperwork goes to the government registry office, where it
    can languish for weeks before officials record the sale and issue a formal title.

    different business cases for participation, not all of which are aligned). The
    blockchain solution might also surface cultural problems. For example, customers
    may need time before they accept a decentralized, digitalized process for exchanging
    their primary source of wealth. Financial questions, such as who pays for the
    solution and who benefits from it, must also be addressed. Finally, the Lantmäteriet
    must consider the regulatory governance of multiparty networks. What’s more, a
    group of banks and real estate companies are developing a competing online web
    portal system that could divide the market or become a better short-term solution.

    the financial system and leads to inconsistencies that cause payment delays or
    rejections and disrupts capital flows.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch3-en2) Isabel Group
    believes blockchain can provide a more efficient alternative and is building a

    Once its identity is captured, the corporation, which will get access to the blockchain
    solution for free, can reuse its record with other banks as well as with third
    parties such as insurance companies or nonbank payment providers, effectively
    creating a digital corporate passport. The identity records could enable Isabel
    Group to offer complementary services such as e-invoicing and fraud management.

    the focus of its initial solutions. Like Isabel Group’s planned solution for KYC
    compliance, RiskBlock’s first application focuses on back-office issues that create
    costs for everyone. That is very common. In our review of consortia activity for
    this book, we see significant, current emphasis on back-office processes, for
    good reason. Fraud-vulnerable, paper-based processes are clear pain points for
    organizations. Solving them can produce widespread benefits in the form of back-office
    efficiency. Leaders under pressure from new digital entrants, however, might not
    want to limit their experiments to process-based challenges. Instead, they could
    diversify the solutions they explore to include those with direct impact on the
    customer. They’ll need to shift their gaze from the inside out to the outside
    in.

    sensors in a car will be able to communicate with sensors located along a driving
    route to exchange information. The German firm Bosch launched a startup called
    StreetProbe with support from the German government to realize one version of
    this concept.[^(29)](../Text/notes.html#ch3-en29) Data points such as driving
    conditions (*Slow down; it’s icy!*); distance traveled (*That’s $3.60 for your
    tolls if you stay in this lane, $5.00 if you switch to the fast lane*); and parking
    availability (*There are three available spots near your destination; would you
    like to reserve one of them?*) could be fed to vehicles and their drivers to facilitate
    decisions. Some of these exchanges already happen through siloed processes mediated
    by humans. For example, drivers can learn about accidents en route from their
    in-car navigation systems, and in-car transponders allow toll booths to register
    car data and charge the correct tolls. Those systems don’t interact with each
    other, however, and they still need a great deal of human intervention to work
    (you have to plug your destination into the navigation system, for example). Human
    input won’t be necessary as IoT matures; municipalities are already preparing

    is an ecosystem enablement and governance challenge where there are potentially
    thousands of suppliers and hundreds of logistics service providers spread across
    many geographically scattered locations. On-boarding these participants on to
    a common platform is hard enough, but how do I get suppliers to consistently do
    what they are supposed to do, when they are supposed to do it, how they are supposed
    to do it, and in a timely and consistent way? It is nearly impossible. On and
    on. It’s very hard to do initially, and it remains difficult to hold the supply
    chain together long term because established relationships are fragile, requiring
    constant care and feeding. Technology is not the issue. Again, we had the technology

- en: We expect consortia and the solutions they develop to evolve along the decentralization

    could improve their solutions. In the next chapter, we explore tokenization and
    how it will drive new forms of digital value and growth.
