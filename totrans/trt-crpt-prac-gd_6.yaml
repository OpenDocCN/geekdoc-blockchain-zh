    of your portfolio into this new asset class. So, let’s keep the conversation in
    perspective, okay? As we’ve learned, a total wipeout of the investment won’t impede
    your ability to enjoy financial security in retirement.

    example, or a new custodian, well, those are features. Focus on the benefits,
    which include improved diversification, lower risk, higher returns, and achievement
    of your financial goals.

    nothing else I’d ever seen. I felt then as you may feel now—that the idea of investing
    in something so new, so unusual, so “unreal,” is uncomfortable.

    A 1% allocation is $1,000\. If you invest that money over 12 monthly installments
    (using dollar cost averaging, as explained in chapter 17), you’ll be investing
    a mere $83 per month. That’s $20 per week, or less than three bucks a day. You
    spend more than $3 a day on soft drinks and snacks—with no hope of seeing that
    money again. At least with digital assets, you might get some money back! When
    you think about it this way, you make it easier to get started.

    losing money, and you don’t know how to resolve the debate, use the tactic Benjamin
    Franklin used whenever he was faced with a choice. Ben described his strategy
    in his autobiography, published in 1771\. He explained that he would take a blank
    sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle of the page. On the left side,
    he would list all the reasons to proceed; on the right, he’d list the reasons
    to decline. Then he’d compare lists.

    more pros than cons, he concluded that the benefits of proceeding outweighed the

    digital assets. I’ve sure heard them, and those stories worried me, too. What
    I’ve discovered is that bitcoin itself is not fraudulent; it merely has sometimes
    found itself involved in fraudulent activities. By the same notion, there’s nothing
    wrong with dollars even though they’ve been involved in many bank robberies.

    The very first security ever sold in the United States—bonds issued by the US
    Treasury in 1792—got caught up in an insider trading scandal. Despite all the
    Ponzi schemes, pump-and-dump scams, affinity frauds, and telemarketing schemes
    involving the stock market, real estate market, and gold market, investors remain
    confident about investing in those asset classes. We must always be careful when
    investing. It’s no different with digital assets.

  prefs:

    what matters—and bitcoin and all other digital assets trade for a price. That
    price is set the same way all asset prices are set: based on supply and demand.
    The supply of bitcoin is limited, so all you have to decide is whether demand
    will increase. That’s one of the best aspects of digital assets. Unlike a hotel
    that sets the price for its rooms, digital assets are decentralized; no single
    company or person sets the price. Instead, the global network does that. It’s
    a reassuring feature of the asset class.'

- en: 'Crashes are just part of investing. You don’t have to like volatility, but
    it’s costly to refrain from investing in an asset class because of worries that
    a crash might occur. The reason: every crash in history has been followed by new,
    all-time highs. There’s no assurance that the market cycle will always perform
    this way, but there’s no reason to believe otherwise, either.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So instead of fearing volatility, smile at it. Consider the next crash to be
    an opportunity to buy while prices are lower. While you wait for that crash, invest
    regularly via dollar cost averaging and engage in portfolio rebalancing. We learned
    about all this in chapter 17.

    prices, too.'

    Of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Stock Index, in 2020, 112 of them were more volatile
    than bitcoin. So, if you’re willing to invest 40% to 80% of your money in the

    not backward—and all indications suggest that the future price of this asset class
    will be higher than the current price. Only 300 million people worldwide own bitcoin.
    That’s about 3% of the world’s population. What might happen to bitcoin’s price
    if 6% of the population decides to buy? If 12% buy? If 24% buy? The growing adoption
    rate is a key reason many believe the future price of bitcoin will be higher than
    the current price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A rising price also makes the price of bitcoin safer, some say. This theory
    says that the higher price reflects greater adoption, and the more people who
    own and use bitcoin, the less likely the price will fall. This is exactly the
    opposite of how the stock market works, by the way: the more a stock price rises,
    the more likely investors will sell—because they’re relating the price to the
    profits of the underlying company. But there is no “corporate profit” with bitcoin,
    and thus that classic “stock market sell signal” does not apply. By this thinking,
    if bitcoin’s price is high, you should be more willing to buy it, not less.'

    occurred on September 17, 1908\. The plane was traveling about 150 feet up in
    the air before it plunged to the ground. Orville was the pilot; he survived, but
    passenger Lt. Thomas Selfridge died. In reviewing events, Orville said things
    would have gone much better if he had been flying much *higher*. Doesn’t that
    seem counterintuitive? After all, if Orville had been closer to the ground when
    problems occurred, Lieutenant Selfridge might not have died. But, no, Orville
    said. By flying only at 150 feet, he didn’t have much time to react to events.
    At an altitude of 1,000 feet, he’d have had far more time to correct the problem.
    In the same way, bitcoin at $50,000 in 2021 is much safer than it was at $479
    in 2012.
