    Its wildly volatile price might make for a fun speculative investment, but the
    instability ruled Bitcoin out as an alternative currency. As far as bankers were
    concerned, Bitcoin had no role to play in the existing financial system. Banking
    institutions thrive on a system of opacity in which our inability to trust each
    other leaves us dependent on their intermediation of our transactions. Bankers
    might give lip service to reforming the inner workings of their system, but the
    thought of turning it over to something as uncontrollable as Bitcoin was beyond
    heresy. It wasn’t even conceivable.

    either. Bitcoin, after all, was designed as an alternative to the existing banking
    system. An improvement. Truth be told, despite an impressive movement that had
    coalesced around this upstart cryptocurrency in the almost seven years before
    the August 2015 event, and despite the innovations and the myriad other cryptocurrencies
    and networks and possibilities it had spawned, Bitcoin really hadn’t made much
    of a dent in reshaping the old order. Wall Street’s money machine remained firmly
    at the center of the global economy—and still does. For now, if you want to use
    technology to improve the world of finance—to reduce systemic risk in bond markets,
    for example, or make it easier for the poor to send and receive money—you still
    need to talk to Wall Street.

    on that sunny August day in 2015\. They took their new, less subversive version
    of Bitcoin downtown, and while their model was better described as “inspired”
    by Bitcoin than as a close copy of it, they still promised a revolution, if a
    more controlled one. Among the Bitcoin-like features their model contained were
    the vital elements of a distributed ledger, a capacity to transfer digitized assets
    peer-to-peer, and low-cost and near-instantaneous transactions. But Symbiont had
    jettisoned other Bitcoin features, including those that obviate the need for banks
    as payment intermediaries. Most notably, this system did not include its own native
    cryptocurrency for rewarding miners and for maintaining a permissionless system
    of validation. In essence, Symbiont was promising “blockchain without bitcoin”—it
    would maintain the fast, secure, and cheap distributed network model, and a truth
    machine at its center that validated transactions, but it was not leaderless,
    permissionless, and open to all. It was a blockchain that Wall Street could control.

    a blockchain is yet to be long-term tested. Some digital currency aficionados
    argue that stripping out the internal cryptocurrency would destroy the integrity
    of a blockchain. Without a native digital currency with which to reward and incentivize
    transaction validation, a permissionless network won’t arise, which falls short
    of what many see as the prerequisite for a truly decentralized system of value
    exchange. Cryptocurrency-less systems necessarily end up as permissioned, or private,
    blockchains, in which the computers that run the network are approved by the company
    or groups of companies that run the ledger. That has its advantages—these networks’
    identifiable members are more easily corralled and governed than Bitcoin’s unruly
    global mob, which means the processing capacity can be scaled more readily. But
    these permissioned systems are less open to experiments by computer engineers,
    and access rights to the data and software are subject to the whim of the official
    gatekeeper. That inherently constrains innovation. A private blockchain, some
    say, is an oxymoron. The whole point of this technology is to build a system that
    is open, accessible, and public. Many describe them with the generic phrase “distributed
    ledger technology” instead of “blockchain.”

    name of the issuer, the amount, the yield (the effective interest rate), the maturity
    date on which the issuer’s bonds fall due, and so on. In this case, he was trading
    a bond issued by SenaHill Partners, an investment firm that had a stake in Symbiont.

    for one of the most contentious financial innovations of our time, the credit
    default swap (CDS), a financial derivative contract in which one institution agrees
    to pay another if a particular bond or loan goes into default. At the age of just
    twenty-five, and as part of a crack team at J.P. Morgan, she conceived of CDSs
    as a way for investors to buy insurance against the risk they bear on their balance
    sheets—and thus to unlock capital hitherto tied up against that risk—as well as
    for other investors, the banks, and other institutions that issue the CDS to place
    a bet on the underlying asset without actually owning it. The contracts were tradable,
    so the parties to a CDS could on-sell them to other, third-party institutions.

    grew to a staggeringly large proportion, with an estimated nominal value of $600
    trillion around the time of the crisis. The problem, as described in more detail
    in Michael Lewis’s The Big Short, among other places, was that no one had a clear
    picture of how risks associated with the obligations owed to one institution might
    influence that institution’s capacity to repay another one, and so on. CDS deals
    were “over-the-counter” trades, unlisted on public exchanges and almost entirely
    unregulated. There was no way to keep track of them. As the crisis worsened, this
    giant, opaque pool of contingent obligations became one of the biggest sources
    of worry—vindicating Warren Buffett, who in 2002 labeled derivatives “weapons
    of financial mass destruction.” The CDS meltdown became a self-fulfilling event
    as it fueled doubts around the solvency of a growing list of banks, so that markets
    were not only worried about the risk of borrowers defaulting on the shaky mortgage
    loans underlying the CDS instruments but also about the insidious problem of counterparty
    and settlement risk. Worried banks, wondering whether their counterparty banks
    could deliver on their promises, began to pull credit out of the market. A toxic
    bundle of interlocking panic arose, one that required tens of trillions of dollars
    of public guarantees, bailouts, and fresh currency issuance by the world’s central
    banks to bring it under control.

    capacity to give everyone the same universal view of every transaction in the
    market. If this transparency-promoting technology had been in place in 2008, Masters
    wondered, would the crisis have even happened? That thought “was like being hit

    and central banks might explore issuing their own digital currencies. Well, as
    of January 2017, twenty-six different central banks were running projects to explore
    blockchain technology, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the
    Bank of Canada, the financial technology news service Finextra reported. Many
    more, smaller central banks are doing preliminary research. Nobody knows what
    will come of these efforts, but the ramifications could be profound.

    a prototype digital fiat currency that central banks and governments might deploy
    is also under way. The starting point is a blockchain toolkit called Cryptokernel,
    created by DCI researcher James Lovejoy, that makes it easier to experiment with
    the technology. CK, as it is known, is open-source software—anyone can experiment
    with it. That’s vital, says Robleh Ali, a research scientist who joined MIT after
    leading the Bank of England’s groundbreaking digital currency project, because
    it means “the design of our future financial system is open to the imagination
    of anyone anywhere. Broadening the number of people working on this gives us a
    better chance of developing a truly decentralized financial system in the hands
    of people, not banks.”

- en: The first application of CK is an experimental digital currency called K320
    that differs from Bitcoin in a critical way. Whereas Bitcoin’s issuance schedule
    is hardwired to max out at 21 million coins by the year 2140, K320’s is not rigidly
    fixed. The hope is that reducing the scarcity factor will dissuade people from
    hoarding the cryptocurrency, an instinct that’s rampant with bitcoin and leaves
    many to conclude that bitcoin’s most important role in society will be as a store
    of value—a digital version of gold, perhaps—rather than as a regular currency
    for day-to-day transactions. Societies need people to spend a currency, not save
    it; the instinct to do the latter is part of a long history of economic problems,
    the most extreme of which were seen during the Great Depression. To avoid this
    fate, K320’s issuance is designed to go on in perpetuity with a mild inflationary
    bias. That means that, after an initial ramped-up release over eight years, the
    supply of coins will eventually slot into a steady increase of 3.2 percent per
    year. This is deliberately just above the 2 percent rate of increase that most
    central banks target for their countries’ consumer price indexes. The K320 team
    is aiming for a balance that’s not too deflationary (which can result in hoarding
    crises like the Great Depression) and not too inflationary (when no one wants
    to hold the currency, as occurred during Germany’s Weimar Republic in the 1920s).

    central banks, it’s unlikely that many in the developed-world central banks would
    adopt a digital currency whose issuance schedule they cannot control. Their first
    digital currency rollouts will likely borrow much more from the current system
    than K320 does. There’s a stronger case to be made that the first central bank
    experiments in algorithmic monetary issuance and digital currencies might happen
    in the developing world, where the payoffs of having political control over the
    currency are put into question by a long history of financial crises. Either way,
    the fact that central banks of all stripes are exploring digital currencies at
    all opens the door to a very different fiat-currency financial system in the future.

    companies looking for a safe place to store funds purely for transactional or
    custodial purposes could now do so with the institution that creates that money.
    It would be cheaper and safer than leaving your money exposed to the solvency
    of a private institution and the fees it would charge to maintain a profit. In
    other words, central banks would become disruptive new competitors to commercial
    banks whenever households and corporate treasurers have to choose where to hold
    short-term funds for payment purposes, whether that money is for groceries or
    for the monthly staff payroll. Think of Apple. It had a staggering $246 billion
    in cash on its books at the end of December 2016\. Most of that was invested in
    short-term “cash-like” instruments such as Treasury bills, but the small percentage
    that sat in bank deposits was still a very large amount of money. It’s reasonable
    to assume that companies like that would move a significant part of their holdings
    into central bank custody, given the choice. This is one reason why researchers
    at the BOE speculated that differential interest rates would be needed—lower for
    central bank digital currencies but higher for bank deposits, perhaps—to discourage
    a destructive exodus of funds and smoothly manage the transition to digital currency.

    the payment business would be a positive thing. In theory, it reduces costs and
    inefficiencies, since profit-seeking banks (some might call them rent-seeking)
    are no longer acting as a tollgate to the economy’s commercial activity. Just
    as importantly, there would be less pressure on governments and central banks
    to bail out banks than there was in 2008, when it was feared that a looming collapse
    would cut off the economy’s payments lifeline. Central banks know too well now
    just how that crisis, which forced them to drive interest rates to zero and left
    them powerless to do more, seriously curtailed their capacity to stimulate economic
    growth. One of the strongest arguments for central bank digital currency, then,
    is that it could foster financial stability.

    For years, a kind of symbiotic relationship existed as banks enjoyed exclusive,
    regulated access to official monetary facilities in return for being agents of
    central bank policy objectives. That has long encouraged conspiracy theorists
    to trot out centuries-old, and often anti-Semitic, myths about secretive cabals
    and the world order. The reality has always been far more complicated than that,
    of course. But now, with blockchain technology offering new models for creating,
    exchanging, and managing currencies, the two sides may actually find themselves
    in direct competition.

    changes. A wide array of non-financial heavy-hitter corporations are also getting
    their feet wet in blockchain technology and grappling with what it means for them.
    One project that’s attracted a lot of their attention is Hyperledger. A broad
    corporate consortium dedicated to a mostly open-source collaborative approach,
    Hyperledger is seeking to develop nothing less than a common blockchain/distributed
    ledger infrastructure for the global economy, one that’s targeted not only at
    finance and banking but also at the Internet of Things, supply chains, and manufacturing.

    interest in seeing the digital global economy evolve into something far more open
    and powerful. Describing the technology as “an operating system for marketplaces,
    data-sharing networks, micro-currencies, and decentralized digital communities,”
    the group’s Web site declared that Hyperledger “has the potential to vastly reduce
    the cost and complexity of getting things done in the real world.” Such a sweeping
    vision can’t afford to be too closed-minded toward the kinds of models that might
    win out in the future. So, it’s notable that among its more than one hundred members
    as of the end of 2016, there were numerous Bitcoin-focused companies inserting
    their case for decentralized cryptocurrency systems. These included Blockstream,
    blockchain applications provider Bloq, and [Blockchain.info](http://Blockchain.info),
    the bitcoin wallet and data-processing company. Still, the biggest players in
    this group were large incumbent companies. And that posed a coordination challenge.
    Those firms’ business models were mostly built on centralized control of data
    and on acting as trusted intermediaries for their customers’ transactions. So,
    inevitably, the same tensions and power battles over the permissionless versus
    permissioned ledger dichotomy seemed bound to arise.

    90 percent of the world’s servers, is widely deployed in routers, set-top boxes,
    and smart TVs, among other devices, and is the bedrock of Google’s Android operating
    system. The Linux story is a textbook case of how open-source software development
    can tap the widest possible talent pool to build the best, most robust, and most
    universally applicable technology. Hyperledger also picked an executive director
    with strong bona fides in the development of open platforms: Brian Behlendorf,

    of designing a new operating system for the global digital economy, it was vital
    that a group like this encourage open innovation, so that potentially disruptive
    new ideas weren’t constrained by threatened gatekeepers. As MIT Media Lab’s Joi
    Ito puts it, the online economy was not won by the closed-loop “intranets” of
    the early networking business—not by France Telecom’s Minitel system, or by the
    internal networks of AOL or Prodigy—but by the fully accessible Internet made
    possible by the TCP/IP pair of open protocols. The Internet’s open constitution
    has since been protected by an alphabet soup of global, not-for-profit bodies—albeit
    with some concern about their excessive power. The Hyperledger project seemed
    to be forming around similar principles.

    its shareholders’ interests to protect, which it serves by pushing to insert coding
    elements that meet its business priorities into the open-source project’s codebase.
    The most well-resourced companies in the consortium are best placed to do that,
    simply by writing reams of code. When those interests contradict those of other
    contributors to the project, disputes and internal politics will arise. “Signing
    off on the press release was the easy part. Making the thing is what’s hard,”
    said Jim Zemlin, Linux Foundation executive director, at the inaugural gathering
    of the Hyperledger membership’s developer community in January 2016\. “We are
    trying to boy-band an open-source project.… We are artificially bringing people
    together who are coming up from a different place. So let’s listen to everyone’s
    perspective.” He told the group about the lesson IBM learned from the Linux development
    process. The company initially rewarded its Linux engineers depending on how much
    IBM code lines they inserted into the project. Presumably the rationale was that
    IBM would profit if the Linux operating system’s underlying code were optimized
    to work with the company’s computers and servers and the particular brand of IT
    solutions it peddled to its clients—especially if dominating the Linux code also
    meant it didn’t work so well with competitors’ models, which were configured differently.
    But, as Zemlin described it, IBM soon realized this was an ineffective way to
    engage with the Linux open-source community. Instead, it started compensating
    its engineers for work that made the overall program function better and found
    that that served IBM’s interests more than anything.

    Hyperledger’s 800-pound gorilla. At that same January 2016 meeting, the tech behemoth
    open-sourced 44,000 lines of its “chaincode” for automated smart contracts, effectively
    donating it to Hyperledger’s common ledger software, now known as Fabric. On the
    one hand, this could be viewed as a generous, no-strings-attached donation of
    resources. But it also meant that the tech giant was setting the shape of the
    project from the start. And as time went on, it seemed like the system IBM had
    in mind was specifically designed to feed into its own, closed-loop business of
    providing “cloud” hosting business. Was this in the interests of the wider community?

    Synchronization Log for financial institutions and Intel bequeathed its Sawtooth
    Lake program for affirming the trustworthiness of computing devices. But IBM’s
    early move made it the major player in the Hyperledger ecosystem. This raised
    the likelihood that it would dominate the design of the system’s underlying code
    and so dictate its business and economic priorities. It’s no different from the
    concerns that people on either side of Bitcoin’s “civil war” raised about which
    companies were paying particular developers’ salaries; they knew that those developers
    would then argue for or against an increase in block size depending on their employers’
    views.

    in supply-chain applications of blockchains. As mentioned in the previous chapter,
    it was already using its code to improve the dispute resolution mechanism for
    vendor and supplier payments within its own business lines. When Jerry Cuomo,
    IBM vice president for blockchain technologies, gave an account of the success
    of that operation at that early Hyperledger meeting, it made a compelling case
    for private blockchains. You didn’t need an open, permissionless system, it seemed,
    to extract value from a blockchain-like approach to sequential record-keeping.
    Yet, unintentionally, he was also showing how the legacy business interests of
    an influential member could distract an open-source consortium like Hyperledger
    from building a truly open, innovative system. It soon became clear that the business
    opportunity IBM saw was to steer clients, particularly those eager to resolve
    supply-chain management problems, back to its own legacy businesses. A year later,
    IBM launched its “Blockchain as a Service” offering—marked by the first TV ad
    to use the word “blockchain.” The service encouraged clients to work with their
    supply-chain partners to create private blockchains that were structured entirely
    around an integration with IBM’s pre-existing cloud service. Having IBM host your
    blockchain-relevant data—relying on a “trusted third party”—kind of goes against
    the whole, disruptive, self-help spirit of the blockchain.

    (In fact, as we discuss elsewhere in this book, specific decentralized applications
    are already being built on blockchain architecture that are intended to provide
    truly decentralized file storage and off-site computer services.) IBM’s blockchain
    model appears to be focused on burnishing a profitable, centralized business that’s
    threatened by that decentralized vision. This is a fully understandable, rational,
    and smart strategy from the point of view of IBM’s shareholders, but it contradicts
    the open-platform spirit conveyed in Hyperledger’s own marketing material. It
    also raises legal questions—if key elements of a blockchain’s data are stored
    on the computers of one company, do the prevailing laws about data residency give
    governments power to control that blockchain?

    That matters because the best option for achieving that will be one that’s led
    by a community that shares our interest in decentralization. Inclusion, opportunity,
    and the most powerful processes of idea generation will ultimately result from
    an open system, one that rejects the excessive influence of institutions whose

    limits of these permissioned blockchain proposals. Those closed intranet models
    eventually lost, Ito points out, because they couldn’t compete with the amount
    of activity and application development drawn to work on the overall, global Internet
    ecosystem. Why would either users or developers want to work with AOL’s clunky
    “you’ve got mail” system when they had access to an open network e-mail system
    to which new features were being added from multiple locations around the world?

    more creativity and innovation, because it’s just understood that no authorizing
    company or group of companies can ever say that this or that thing cannot be built.
    Even if the stewards of the permissioned systems say they will make their platforms
    open to others, having them as gatekeepers leaves open the possibility of restrictions
    on outsiders. And that will give pause to open-source volunteers who might otherwise
    be drawn to work on such platforms. It’s the guarantee of open access that fosters
    enthusiasm and passion for “permissionlessness” networks. That’s already evident
    in the caliber and rapid expansion in the number of developers working on public
    blockchain applications. Permissioned systems will have their place, if nothing
    else because they can be more easily programmed at this early stage of the technology’s
    life to handle heavier transaction loads. But the overarching objective for all
    of us should be to encourage the evolution of an open, interoperable permissionless
