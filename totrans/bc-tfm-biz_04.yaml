    when she became one of the main suspects of a political assassination in the United
    Arab Emirates. At the time, the Australian was six months pregnant. She was out
    driving on a Wednesday when she heard her name read out as one of the assassins
    responsible for the murder of the Hamas chief Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel
    room a few days earlier [106]. However, she had never been to Dubai and being
    six months pregnant she was not a likely suspect of an assassination. Nicole had
    become victim to identity theft. Somehow the thieves had used her personal identifiable
    information to create a fake passport and used that to enter Dubai [107]. As a
    result, she was now wanted for murder in Dubai, along with 17 other westerners,
    whose identities were also stolen by members of a hit squad believed to have acted
    on the orders of Israeli spy agency Mossad [108].

    she had to pay a visit to her daughter in Portland, Oregon. The then 64-year-old
    retired nurse had to care for her daughter who was having health problems and
    she had asked her niece, Samantha, to house sit. When Helen came back in October
    2012, she found out that her niece had given Alice Lipski, a meth addict, shelter
    in Helen’s house for a few days. Helen told Alice to leave, but the damage had
    already been done, as she later discovered. While she was away, Alice had stolen
    personal identifiable information from mail and receipts that Helen kept in her
    house and Alice used that information to take over Helen’s identity. Alice signed
    up to a credit monitoring service, which is intended to help protect citizens
    from identity theft, and subsequently reported every inactive credit card as stolen
    in order to get new cards, usernames, and passwords. With these new cards, Alice
    purchased food and clothes, paid for gas bills, went to the casino, and racked
    up a total bill of $US30,000 in just six months. In total, before Alice was arrested,
    she had stolen almost $US1 million by using Helen’s information and that of dozens
    of other victims [106, 109].

    victim to identity theft. Axton’s father and grandfather were also victims of
    an identity theft that had started almost 20 years earlier. Becoming a victim
    of identity theft is a nasty experience, but it is made much worse when you find
    out that your mother was the one who perpetrated the crime. For almost two decades,
    Axton’s mother lived a secret life, while she was (seemingly) happily married.
    During those years, she stole the identity of her husband, daughter, and father-in-law—defrauding
    her own family of thousands of dollars. For 20 years, her mother had committed
    a breach of trust that left Axton and her father in deep trouble. As a consequence
    of this identity theft, Axton’s credit rating was degraded and she had to pay
    hundreds of dollars in fees, interest rates, and deposits. In addition to all
    the trouble that comes with identity theft, Axton also had to deal with discovering
    that her mother was not whom she thought she was [106, 110].

    However, Nakeisha was not only helping the victims, but also helping herself.
    With the access she had to the IRS databases, she was able to steal names, birth
    dates, and social security numbers. She used this personal identifiable information
    to submit false tax returns and requested the refunds on debit cards, which she
    used to fund her lifestyle. In total, she managed to steal over $US400,000, although
    she intended to steal almost a million dollars from the people she was supposed
    to help. Today, she is serving a nine-year sentence in a federal prison after
    pleading guilty to identity theft and tax fraud [106, 111].

    likes of Nakeisha. In fact, identity fraud and theft are a problem that over 15
    million people in the USA alone encounter every year, resulting in annual financial
    losses of up to $US50 billion [112]. Identity theft comes in a wide variety of
    forms and can have a big impact on someone’s life, sometimes disrupting it for
    several years. Unfortunately, with most of our communication being done digitally,
    thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated at stealing personal
    identifiable information. As such, it has become relatively easy to steal someone’s
    identity and commit all kinds of crimes. However, identity is becoming more and
    more important and, nowadays, it is almost impossible to purchase any service,
    subscription, or financial product without revealing your identity and disclosing
    your personal identifiable information. Even when you want to enter a bar or buy
    alcohol, you have to prove who you are, although, in fact, the only thing they
    really need to know is your age.

    and too many people fall victim to identity theft, that is, if you at least have
    an identity. Article 6 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights stipulates
    that ‘Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the
    law’. As such, identity is a fundamental human right. Unfortunately, according
    to the World Bank, approximately 1.5 billion people live without an officially
    recognised identity, most of them in Africa or Asia. These people do not own a
    government-issued and -recognised document, and often are the most vulnerable
    people who cannot access basic services because they lack an official identity.
    In the digital society in which we live, it is therefore time for change and,
    if we want to solve some of the Wicked Problems discussed in this book, we first
    need to solve the identity problem. As it stands, Blockchain might be a suitable
    technology to do so. Before we dive into how to solve this identity problem and
    what the role of Blockchain could be, let’s first discuss what identity actually
    is, because it might not be as straightforward as you think it is.

    Delphi, and since then philosophers, psychologists, scientists, poets, authors,
    artists, and politicians have discussed and debated the topic. Plato referred
    to it as long-standing wisdom, which was given as advice by the Gods, and, according
    to Socrates, ‘to know thyself is the beginning of wisdom’. It seems so easy to
    answer the questions ‘Who am I?’ and ‘What is my identity?’, but it is a lot more
    difficult than one would expect and many people disagree as to what identity is.
    Is your identity what is stated on your government-issued identity document such
    as a passport or driver’s licence, assuming that you have such a document? Is
    identity your name that your parents gave you or is it the nickname that your
    friends gave you? Is identity your Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn username, is
    it your employee number at your work, or is it your social security number or
    your credit card number? If your credit card number has been stolen, has your
    identity been stolen as well? What about the pseudonyms that you use when you
    comment on different forums on the web, or is the username that you created for
    that dating website your identity? What if those websites get hacked? If you suffer
    from dementia and forget your name, have you then lost your identity? If you are
    schizophrenic, do you have multiple identities? These are just some of the questions
    that come up when thinking about identity. But that is not all. Once you have
    identified who you are, we have to deal with the persistence of identity; which
    you is you? Is your identity who you are today, yesterday, or tomorrow? Is it
    your physical appearance, your perceived identity, your feelings and thoughts,
    or your actions? If you change your attitudes, behaviour, or even your physical
    body (your cells are replacing themselves constantly), does it change who you
    are? In addition, is your perceived identity different from your real identity?
    Your feelings about yourself and your characteristics might be perceived differently
    by you than by others. You might identity yourself as a shy, introverted person,
    whereas others view you as a confident and extraverted person. The way in which
    we perceive our identity, however, determines how we experience life—does this
    mean that it is part of your identity or is your identity how others see you?
    As hard as it may seem to answer this rather philosophical question in the analogue
    world, it seems a little bit easier to address in the digital world, as we shall
    see. Nevertheless, as you may have discovered by now, identity is a lot more complex
    than you might have thought, bearing in mind that we have not yet embarked on
    questions about group identity and all those devices that you can connect to the
    internet: do they have an identity as well? As it happens, they do, but we will
    get back to that in a bit.'

    different attributes, which are constantly changing and evolving in terms of priority
    and durability. Some attributes, such as your name and social security number,
    might stay with you for your entire life. For a number of reasons, a person might
    change their name one or more times. Others, such as your employee number, your
    student number, and your address or phone number, will come and go on a constant
    basis. Some attributes stay with you for several years or more, whereas others
    can be very short-lived, such as a username on a forum or website. Each of these
    attributes has different, uniquely identifiable characteristics and their combination
    makes up who you are, although you might perceive that differently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that is they are data. Your social security number, name, date of birth, or address
    is recorded in a government database, whereas your certificates and employee number
    are recorded by educational institutions or your work. Usernames, phone numbers,
    credit card details, and many more attributes are recorded by commercial, or not-for-profit,
    organisations such as your bank, your telecom provider, or your local supermarket.
    Even your physical appearances and attributes may have been recorded in your Electronic
    Health Records. As a result, your identity is scattered in thousands of pieces
    and stored across thousands of databases around the globe, over which you have
    only limited, if any, control. Some may only record a username, whereas others,
    such as the US Customs, might want your biometrics, social security numbers, address,
    and much more. This immediately reveals one of the challenges of identity; it
    is digitally distributed across the virtual world and who owns your identity is
    not always clear.

    as your sense of humour or your trustworthiness are known only to those who know
    you personally and are not usually recorded. They are a very important aspect
    of your identity. However, this is changing rapidly as online services such as
    Uber, Facebook, eBay, LinkedIn, or even Tinder record your sentiments, trustworthiness,
    or reputation, in large databases, and this reputation plays an increasingly important
    role if you want to use those services. For example, if your Uber, or Lyft, reputation
    score, as either a driver or a passenger, hits below a certain threshold, you
    can no longer use the service. As such, these companies have a powerful control
    mechanism over you and you have an incentive to behave, if you wish to continue
    to use the system. As it appears, with the possibility of recording every transaction
    and every interaction, reputation is rapidly increasing in importance.

    from a service that many of you have used and, if you did, you probably would
    not want that information to be made public. We are talking about Silk Road, an
    anonymous website on the dark web that was used to trade illicit goods and services,
    including drugs, weapons, and even murders for hire. It was named after the trading
    routes linking the East and the West in the 13th century and, as with the original
    Silk Road, trade was the main activity at the platform. However, when you are
    dealing with illegal goods and services, you are dealing with criminals who, by
    their nature, are difficult to trust. With trade, trust is vital, even among criminals.
    If you ordered some drugs on the platform you needed to be sure that you got what
    you ordered and the seller needs to be certain that he or she got paid. In order
    to solve this problem, Silk Road used a reputation system, an eBay-style, peer
    review system [113], which allowed buyers and sellers to review the other party,
    and their goods or services, before a transaction would take place. The system
    incentivised good behaviour, which worked remarkably well until Silk Road was
    shut down in October 2013\. In recent years, online reputation has gained traction
    and most of the well-known online services use some sort of reputation score:
    TripAdvisor rates hotels and destinations, Uber rates its passengers and drivers,
    AirBnB rates its hosts and guests, Netflix rates its movies and documentaries,
    Tinder rates its singles, and Glassdoor rates organisations. As such, reputation
    has become an important aspect of our lives, thereby incentivising good behaviour,
    and we foresee that this will only increase in the years to come, thanks to Blockchain,

    build their identity and reputation, as well as how they use your identity and
    reputation. Naturally, organisations also have a wide variety of attributes that
    make up their identity: their culture, the people who work there, the brand image,
    company symbols and icons, their leaders, the rules and regulations, the products
    and services offered, customer service, etc. Each of these attributes interacts
    with others to create a company identity and reputation that directly influence
    your identity and reputation when you deal with that company. Think of Apple;
    for many people Apple is like a religion [114]. People want to be identified by
    the products and they value the attributes that are linked to the Apple brand,
    such as innovation, power to the people, passion, aspirations [115]. In addition,
    Apple has a certain reputation, built up over decades of creating products and
    interacting with billions of customers. In fact, in 2017 Apple landed in 20th
    place in the Reputation Institute’s Global RepTrak 100, a ranking that measures
    public perception of major companies around the world [116]. As such, organisations

    identity. This is especially relevant for the Internet of Things, where devices
    and machines are connected to the internet and can interact with other devices
    as well as people. As with people and organisations, machines have a variety of
    attributes as well as a reputation that make up its identity, for example, the
    type of device, such as a car; which version, such as model ABC; and the characteristics
    of the device, such as it is red, has four wheels, is electric, and three years
    old. In addition, the car has a reputation: is it responsive in the communication,
    does it talk to other actors on the road (in the case of a self-driving car),
    does it do what it says it will do (for example, it communicates that it will
    overtake a car, but, if it does not do that, this could cause trouble on the road)?
    All these aspects make up the reputation of the car and the higher the reputation
    the more likely other devices, and humans, will want to deal with the machine.
    Would you like to enter a self-driving taxi with a very low reputation? Probably
    not. When machines start interacting with each other, for example as part of a
    smart grid, which we discuss in [Chapter 6](ch0006.xlink.xhtml), the price of,
    in this case a kilowatt, could go up or down based on the reputation of the device.

    network economy in which we live, where people, organisations, and machines interact
    in a continuously changing network, is what we like to call shadow reputation.
    Within networks, reputation is made up by those with whom you interact (the people,
    companies, and machines, that is the actors in your network). Dealing with trustworthy
    actors increases your reputation and as such changes your identity. The opposite
    is also the case, dealing with untrustworthy actors, for example criminals, will
    negatively affect your reputation and as such your identity. You can compare this
    as ‘having the wrong friends’ and, when you become too closely linked to ‘the
    wrong friends’, it will directly affect how people view you and as such have an
    impact on your identity. This shadow reputation is intrinsically linked to who
    you are and how others identify you.

    and machines, and is inherently connected to identity. An interesting example
    of this happened during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008\. Those people
    who worked at a bank at that time, and especially one of those banks that had
    to be bailed out, preferred not to talk about what they did and where they worked
    when they were at a party, because it would result in strange looks and difficult
    questions, and people would change their perception about them almost instantly.
    This is an example of shadow reputation: where the negative reputation of the
    bank at that time directly influenced how people perceived the bank’s employees.
    Of course, what goes for people and organisations also goes for machines. If too
    many machines within a smart grid have a bad reputation, the reputation of the
    smart grid will go down. Or if a machine is connected to a machine infected with
    malware, it will directly affect the reputation of that device.'

    of identity theft. Identity theft is only one of the many challenges within the
    current identity system that we have developed with each other. Our global identity
    system was developed in and for an analogue world and, although we have entered
    the digital world, our identity systems have not yet followed. The existing problems
    with identity relate to security (personal identifiable information is scattered
    around thousands of, often insecure, databases) and routines (the hotel where
    you are staying making a copy of your passport) resulting in the relative ease
    with which an identity can be stolen. In addition, with identity still residing
    in the analogue world, verification of identities is expensive and difficult and
    can easily result in flaws. On the other hand, online identity verification is
    hopelessly outdated, with many websites still allowing passwords such as abcd1234
    or password. Offline verification, meanwhile, requires all kinds of additional
    personal identifiable information, which are not relevant but, as there is no
    other way, inevitable. For example, when purchasing alcohol at a shop, your name
    really is not relevant to determining whether you are legally allowed to buy alcohol.
    Finally, the biggest challenge of them all is the 1.5 billion people without a
    proper identity, who as a result of this do not have access to banking, job security,
    education, and other human rights. If we wish to solve some of the Wicked Problems

    and time-consuming task, involving multiple documents from a variety of organisations,
    as well as verification questions to prove who you are. Verifying your identity
    happens all the time, online and offline. ‘In the physical world, there are fairly
    accepted ways to verify who you are, like a driver’s licence or a passport’, says
    Cameron Gough, digital delivery centre general manager at Australia Post. ‘But
    in the digital world we don’t have this. So, . . . organisations have a trade-off
    between fraud and friction, and convenience. They would love to decrease the level
    of fraud but usually the mechanisms available to do that result in an increase
    in inconvenience or friction for customers’ [123]. Organisations such as banks,
    telcos, social media websites, or online retailers need to verify your identity
    when you want to do business with them, often because of regulation such as Know
    Your Customer or Client (KYC). KYC is the process that financial institutions,
    in particular, need to have in place in order to verify the identity of customers
    to prevent money-laundering activities or even financing of terrorism. It consists

    up an account at a new bank, you will have to go through the same process again,
    even if you have already been verified by a different institution. KYC requires
    the financial institutions to know who you are and what your activities are, and
    to assess money-laundering risks [124]. However, banks are not the only institutions
    that employ KYC; other companies use it to make sure that they deal with legitimate
    persons or companies. In recent years, KYC has been expanded to KYCC, or Know
    Your Customer’s or Client’s Customer or Client. It takes the KYC requirements
    to a higher level, because it requires knowledge of whom your customers are dealing
    with, what their sources of funds are, and their risk of money laundering. The
    only way to comply is to demand proof of the legitimacy of the funds and transactions.
    As a result, as of 11 May 2018 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Final Rule will come
    into effect in the USA. In June 2017, the 4th AML Directive went into effect in

    customers’ customers to mitigate suspicious transactions, risks, and financial
    crime [125]. As you can imagine, complying with these regulations will be time-consuming
    and expensive, although not complying can be a lot more expensive due to heavy
    fines and reputational harm.

    measures such as KYC and KYCC (and in the future KYCCC?), verification of identity
    is still not secure, as evidenced by the scale of global identity theft and the
    ease with which identity can be faked or purchased. For example, the price of
    a fake US passport on the dark web starts at just $US938 [126]. In addition, the
    more companies have to store customer and customers’ customer data, the higher
    the risks become that such data will be stolen by hackers, because not all companies
    will ensure the highest level of security. At the same time, people constantly
    have to provide their details on the web and remember details such as usernames
    and passwords. As a result, people often use very simple passwords, increasing
    the risks even more.

    participate in social and economic activity, not possessing one can have deeply
    damaging consequences for individuals. Yet, around 1.5 billion people, or 20%
    of the global population, does not have any proof of an officially recognised
    identity. Most of these people live in developing countries and are already dealing
    with multiple other Wicked Problems. Not having an identity only increases these
    problems, because it prevents them from joining the modern economy, to vote, and
    to have access to basic services such as opening a bank account or having a telephone
    subscription. In addition, the ‘unidentified’ face increased human trafficking
    risks, because they are invisible before the law and as such cannot claim any
    rights. Although having an officially recognised identity is a basic human right
    recognised by the United Nations’ Universal Declaration on Human rights, too many

    India. In 2009 the government launched the project AadHaar, which is the world’s
    largest biometric identity system. The objective of the system is to provide every
    Indian with a government-issued identity card, linked to their biometric details
    and with a 12-digit number based on their biometrics and demographics. As of April
    2017, 1.133 billion people had been enrolled, or 99% of Indian citizens aged over
    18 years. It is the world’s most sophisticated identity platform and has a capacity
    to enrol 1 million people per day [128]. This proof of identity enables Indian
    citizens to have easy, online, and portable access to government services, and
    the system is linked, through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), with
    other, non-governmental services such as banks. As such, it enables those organisations
    to comply with KYC. AadHaar is a great example of how a government brought their
    identity system into the 21st century, although, as is always the case with projects

    system to the 21st century and bring identity to the Blockchain. This will not

    Blockchain and as such all the problems that currently exist with identity still
    remain. Blockchain offers enormous potential to solve our identity crisis. Having
    ‘an identity on the Blockchain’ will make it immutable, traceable, and verifiable,
    thereby significantly reducing the possibilities for identity theft, making identity
    verification seamless, and giving power back to the user. Building a digital identity
    on the Blockchain would act as a digital watermark, similar to the way that traditional
    identity documents such as passports have a watermark to verify the document’s
    authenticity [129]. This digital watermark then enables any organisation with
    access to the Blockchain to check identity on every transaction, in real time.
    If you can check someone’s identity on every transaction, this would eliminate
    the possibility of fraud. As such, enabling identity on the Blockchain is a $US4.2
    trillion opportunity, that is the global annual cost of fraud, according to research
    from the University of Portsmouth [129]. Contrary to today, verification of someone’s
    identity would be at almost no cost, because the customer would simply ‘lend’
    their digital identity when necessary, without revealing any information that
    is not necessary for that particular transaction.

- en: However, before we delve further into this topic, the first thing we need to
    make clear is that putting your identity on the Blockchain does not mean putting
    personal identifiable information, such as your passport, social security number,
    or any other attribute, on the Blockchain. Blockchain is used to manage keys,
    anchor data records in time, and make them immutable, as well as to discover those
    records when necessary. It is, and should never be, used to store personal identifiable
    information and the reason is simple. Linking personal identifiable information
    to, for example, coins means that information will remain there indefinitely and
    becomes always traceable. If you were to do so, it would mean that you would use
    one or only a few coins to link those attributes, which would immediately expose
    it to discovery of correlations among them, even if you would not be able to decrypt
    the data. In addition, as we already established earlier, your attributes constantly
    evolve over time, so that is not something that you should want to be immutable
    because attributes that are legal today can become illegal tomorrow. Instead,
    if we want to put identity on the Blockchain, we should remove all data related
    to the person and store only the token on the Blockchain, and allow the user to
    store their personal identifiable information on their own device of choice, which
    will probably be a smartphone or something of that sort. As a result, consumers
    will get back control of their own identity. Meanwhile, attributes scattered across
    thousands of databases will become a thing of the past and the unidentified can
    obtain a digital identity, simply by collecting and controlling their attributes,
    reputation, and shadow reputation using a blockchain.

- en: How does that work? In order to explain this we first need to clarify something
    about Public Key Infrastructure, because it is intrinsically linked to identity
    on the Blockchain and, to do so, we have to go back in time to the 1970s. In 1976,
    two Stanford mathematicians, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, discovered an
    advanced mathematical relationship called asymmetric cryptography. They identified
    a relationship between large prime numbers, where data encrypted with one key,
    could be decrypted by its paired key. At the same time, in 1978, three other mathematicians
    named Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman identified the same relationship
    and published it as the RSA algorithm [130]. They were able to monetise this algorithm
    and build a company around it (RSA Corporation), which was eventually sold to
    EMC and now belongs to Dell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Asymmetric cryptography means that two keys, a public and a private key, are
    mathematically related to each other. This relationship means that any data encrypted
    by one key (public key) can be decrypted only by the other (private key) and vice
    versa. It is impossible to encrypt data with a public key and use another public
    key to decrypt that data [49]. As a result, you can use a key pair to identify
    the owner of a certain digital asset. As the public key is publically available,
    any data encrypted with a related private key can be decrypted only by the corresponding
    public key. Hence, if Alice encrypts a file with her private key and sends it
    to Bob, who uses the corresponding public key, he can be certain that Alice was
    the one who encrypted the file. The other way is also possible: if Bob wants to
    send Alice a private message, he encrypts the file with the public key that is
    mathematically linked to Alice’s private key. If Alice receives the message, she
    is the only one who can open the message using her private key. Therefore, it
    is vital that she keeps her private key really private. It works like a mailbox,
    where everyone has a key to deposit a letter to that mailbox, but only one person
    has the right key to open the mailbox and take the mail out.'

    that you do online uses the Public Key Infrastructure, from sending emails to
    visiting websites (a website is encrypted using the Public Key Infrastructure
    if it has an SSL certificate and the website shows https). It means that we can
    be certain that the data that is sent between the user and the server is not interrupted.
    Public Private Key Infrastructure is also used to ensure authenticity of a certain
    document. This is done using the Hash Algorithm as discussed in [Chapter 2](ch0002.xlink.xhtml).
    Hash Algorithms are special mathematical formulae that will turn any input into
    a unique fixed-length output of numbers and letters. Changing the input will completely
    change the output. If you want to secure a message or data file, you hash the
    data and then encrypt it using the Public Key Infrastructure. As a result, the
    identity of the sender can be proved and the authenticity of the data file verified,
    revealing whether or not the file has been tampered with. In the traditional and
    centralised internet, Public Key Infrastructure relies on centralised trusted
    third parties, called Certificate Authorities (CAs). These CAs issue, revoke,
    and restore the key pairs, for every stakeholder involved. Apart from the fact
    that these are centralised companies exerting a lot of control, hackers can potentially
    spoof user identities, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and thereby intercept
    communications [131]. As of May 2017, there are several research projects working
    on decentralised version of the Public Key Infrastructure, each taking a slightly
    different approach. Of course, there is a lot more to cryptography in terms of
    technicalities, but this is enough to know. The combination of Public Key Infrastructure
    and Hash Algorithms is used extensively on the Blockchain and is, more or less,
    what enables identity on the Blockchain.

- en: Another concept that we need to cover is tokenisation, before we can tie it
    all together. Every Blockchain uses tokens to help validate transactions and create
    the blocks, which are subsequently chained together. A token on a blockchain can
    mean several things. Either they are referred to currency tokens, such as bitcoin
    (BTC), or they are referred to asset tokens. Currency tokens are the most well-known
    tokens, simply because the first crypto token ever, Bitcoin, is a currency token.
    A currency token is a medium of value exchange, and the value of the token is
    determined by supply and demand. Contrary to fiat money, which is backed by gold,
    currency tokens are only backed by the demand in the market. The other type of
    token is ‘Asset Tokens’, which are claims to an underlying asset that belongs
    to a certain issuer or user. They can be best compared with an ‘I Owe You’ (IOU)
    when you, for example in the old days, could bring gold to a goldsmith who would
    write an IOU, which you could then trade. Anyone who owns that IOU could go to
    the goldsmith and trade it for the original gold. Asset-backed tokens are the
    digital equivalent of an IOU and it enables you to track a certain asset as it
    moves from person to person. Once you have ‘tokenised’ an asset (either tangible
    or digital), you can track its movements. New digital tokens are created every
    day to track new assets from diamonds to music to art. Asset-backed tokens can
    be traded and eventually someone can trade it back to the original asset [132].
    Apart from physical items such as paintings or digital assets such as music, you
    can also tokenise an identity attribute, since it is also an asset, albeit an
    intangible one. However, instead of transferring the token from person to person,
    you ‘lend’ it to the other party and retain ownership of the token. We also have
    security tokens and utility tokens. A security token is a token that allows the
    owner of that token a (future) stake in a company, while a utility token is a
    token that has a use case and has not been developed as an investment. Most of
    today’s Blockchain startups aim to develop their token as a use case.

    system would be better than the current model. However, the main disadvantage
    of a completely new identity system would be the cost of building the infrastructure,
    resulting in an initial hiccup in the set-up. In addition, it would be a complex
    infrastructure to build and implement, but, as we shall see, multiple organisations
    are already working on solving this. Another disadvantage of a self-sovereign
    identity is that the average user might not want to deal with storing private
    keys on a smartphone and/or in the cloud. This is something intangible that consumers
    are not used to. In addition, all too often smartphones are stolen and, if the
    smartphone is not secured with biometrics, the thief can access the encrypted
    identity information. If the user had not created a back-up in the cloud, he or
    she has a serious issue. The way around these two issues is to always require
    users to use biometric security on their phone and a secure back-up of the identity
    information on the smartphone.

    not surprising that the it has embraced Blockchain to improve many of their outdated
    systems. It will also go a long way to saving a lot of money (which, not surprisingly,
    might be the main reason for them moving to the Blockchain). Using a distributed

- en: One of the main features of Blockchain is that it removes the need for a trusted
    intermediary and makes peer-to-peer transactions possible. When Blockchain is
    applied to the financial services industry, it could render obsolete the fee-charging
    intermediaries such as custodian banks (those that transfer money between different
    banks) or clearing houses (those vouching for counterparty’s credit positions).
    As such, Blockchain offers better capital optimisation, due to a significant reduction
    in operational costs for banks. In addition, when banks share a Blockchain, the
    total costs of that Blockchain and the surrounding ecosystem might be higher than
    the individual costs of managing transactions at a bank. However, the costs are
    shared among all participating banks so there is a significant cost reduction.
    Finally, according to research by Accenture, financial reporting costs could drop
    70% due to optimised data quality, transparency, and internal controls. Compliance
    costs could drop 30–50% due to transparency and better auditability of transactions,
    as well as improved and more efficient KYC processes. Finally, business operation
    costs could drop 50% due to the reduction and removal of unnecessary processes
    [134]. When transactions are settled almost instantly, it removes a significant
    part of the risk of a counterparty not meeting its obligations (otherwise a substantial
    expense for banks).

    and the National Health Service, combined with blockchain technology, to track
    personal healthcare data [137]. According to DeepMind co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman,
    this has been called ‘Verifiable Data Audit’ and it will ‘record the fact that
    a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why, for example,
    that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm to detect
    possible acute kidney injury’ [138]. They are building an auditing system for
    healthcare data [139]. As a result, any access of and changes made to the patient’s
    data are immediately visible and can be tracked by the system. Contrary to public
    blockchains (such as the bitcoin blockchain), the distributed ledger that will
    be used provides access only to trusted stakeholders such as hospitals and national
    institutions for verification of the integrity of the ledgers. However, the result
    is the same: any entry to the ledger is immutable, verifiable, and traceable by
    those with access to the ledger. The system could become a federated patient-identified
    information database that allows relevant stakeholders to perform valuable research
    to create better healthcare, without breaching patient privacy. Instead, it puts
    humans back in control of their healthcare data. Imagine the possibilities, when
    the system that DeepMind is developing is combined with a global self-sovereign
    identity system? This would mean that you would carry your own digital healthcare
    records across the globe, in a secure and private way. Whenever you need healthcare,
    anywhere in the world, you could provide local caregivers with secure access to
    your relevant healthcare data, ensuring that you have the best possible care.
    When you get home, your own doctor can see exactly what happened, what treatment

    that have identities. Organisations and many things are also uniquely identifiable.
    With the rise of the Internet of Things, which will connect billions of devices

    existing identity system has some serious flaws: identity theft is commonplace,

    are excluded from obtaining a government-issued proof of identity, leaving them
    vulnerable and without access to basic services. However, we can bring identity
    to the 21st century by creating a digital identity, a self-sovereign identity,
    that uses distributed ledgers to make identity data immutable, verifiable, and
    traceable. A self-sovereign identity can be described according to the 5Ps; personal,
    private, persistent, protected, and portable. It uses tokenisation as well as
    encryption with the Public Key Infrastructure to prevent identity theft, improve
    identity verification, and help those who are excluded by giving them a digital
    identity. Those who are excluded can use different personal data traits and digital
    social connections to verify who they are, simply by using an App installed on

    accounts, apply as a refugee, and apply for many more services that will improve

    never as it is put on a blockchain. Putting an address, biometric data, or even
    a passport on a blockchain is a serious privacy risk, which is why tokenisation
