    when she became one of the main suspects of a political assassination in the United
    Arab Emirates. At the time, the Australian was six months pregnant. She was out
    driving on a Wednesday when she heard her name read out as one of the assassins
    responsible for the murder of the Hamas chief Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel
    room a few days earlier [106]. However, she had never been to Dubai and being
    six months pregnant she was not a likely suspect of an assassination. Nicole had
    become victim to identity theft. Somehow the thieves had used her personal identifiable
    information to create a fake passport and used that to enter Dubai [107]. As a
    result, she was now wanted for murder in Dubai, along with 17 other westerners,
    whose identities were also stolen by members of a hit squad believed to have acted
    on the orders of Israeli spy agency Mossad [108].

- en: In early 2012, American Helen Anderson^([1](#note1)) was living in Seattle when
    she had to pay a visit to her daughter in Portland, Oregon. The then 64-year-old
    retired nurse had to care for her daughter who was having health problems and
    she had asked her niece, Samantha, to house sit. When Helen came back in October
    2012, she found out that her niece had given Alice Lipski, a meth addict, shelter
    in Helen’s house for a few days. Helen told Alice to leave, but the damage had
    already been done, as she later discovered. While she was away, Alice had stolen
    personal identifiable information from mail and receipts that Helen kept in her
    house and Alice used that information to take over Helen’s identity. Alice signed
    up to a credit monitoring service, which is intended to help protect citizens
    from identity theft, and subsequently reported every inactive credit card as stolen
    in order to get new cards, usernames, and passwords. With these new cards, Alice
    purchased food and clothes, paid for gas bills, went to the casino, and racked
    up a total bill of $US30,000 in just six months. In total, before Alice was arrested,
    she had stolen almost $US1 million by using Helen’s information and that of dozens
    of other victims [106, 109].

    victim to identity theft. Axton’s father and grandfather were also victims of
    an identity theft that had started almost 20 years earlier. Becoming a victim
    of identity theft is a nasty experience, but it is made much worse when you find
    out that your mother was the one who perpetrated the crime. For almost two decades,
    Axton’s mother lived a secret life, while she was (seemingly) happily married.
    During those years, she stole the identity of her husband, daughter, and father-in-law—defrauding
    her own family of thousands of dollars. For 20 years, her mother had committed
    a breach of trust that left Axton and her father in deep trouble. As a consequence
    of this identity theft, Axton’s credit rating was degraded and she had to pay
    hundreds of dollars in fees, interest rates, and deposits. In addition to all
    the trouble that comes with identity theft, Axton also had to deal with discovering
    that her mother was not whom she thought she was [106, 110].

    a decade and her job was to help people who had fallen victim to identity theft.
    However, Nakeisha was not only helping the victims, but also helping herself.
    With the access she had to the IRS databases, she was able to steal names, birth
    dates, and social security numbers. She used this personal identifiable information
    to submit false tax returns and requested the refunds on debit cards, which she
    used to fund her lifestyle. In total, she managed to steal over $US400,000, although
    she intended to steal almost a million dollars from the people she was supposed
    to help. Today, she is serving a nine-year sentence in a federal prison after
    pleading guilty to identity theft and tax fraud [106, 111].

- en: Nicole, Helen, and Axton are not the only victims of identity theft from the
    likes of Nakeisha. In fact, identity fraud and theft are a problem that over 15
    million people in the USA alone encounter every year, resulting in annual financial
    losses of up to $US50 billion [112]. Identity theft comes in a wide variety of
    forms and can have a big impact on someone’s life, sometimes disrupting it for
    several years. Unfortunately, with most of our communication being done digitally,
    thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated at stealing personal
    identifiable information. As such, it has become relatively easy to steal someone’s
    identity and commit all kinds of crimes. However, identity is becoming more and
    more important and, nowadays, it is almost impossible to purchase any service,
    subscription, or financial product without revealing your identity and disclosing
    your personal identifiable information. Even when you want to enter a bar or buy
    alcohol, you have to prove who you are, although, in fact, the only thing they
    really need to know is your age.

- en: Identity has become flawed as too often our privacy is breached unnecessarily
    and too many people fall victim to identity theft, that is, if you at least have
    an identity. Article 6 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights stipulates
    that ‘Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the
    law’. As such, identity is a fundamental human right. Unfortunately, according
    to the World Bank, approximately 1.5 billion people live without an officially
    recognised identity, most of them in Africa or Asia. These people do not own a
    government-issued and -recognised document, and often are the most vulnerable
    people who cannot access basic services because they lack an official identity.
    In the digital society in which we live, it is therefore time for change and,
    if we want to solve some of the Wicked Problems discussed in this book, we first
    need to solve the identity problem. As it stands, Blockchain might be a suitable
    technology to do so. Before we dive into how to solve this identity problem and
    what the role of Blockchain could be, let’s first discuss what identity actually
    is, because it might not be as straightforward as you think it is.

- en: 'Know thyself was inscribed in the forecourt of the Greek Temple of Apollo at
    Delphi, and since then philosophers, psychologists, scientists, poets, authors,
    artists, and politicians have discussed and debated the topic. Plato referred
    to it as long-standing wisdom, which was given as advice by the Gods, and, according
    to Socrates, ‘to know thyself is the beginning of wisdom’. It seems so easy to
    answer the questions ‘Who am I?’ and ‘What is my identity?’, but it is a lot more
    difficult than one would expect and many people disagree as to what identity is.
    Is your identity what is stated on your government-issued identity document such
    as a passport or driver’s licence, assuming that you have such a document? Is
    identity your name that your parents gave you or is it the nickname that your
    friends gave you? Is identity your Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn username, is
    it your employee number at your work, or is it your social security number or
    your credit card number? If your credit card number has been stolen, has your
    identity been stolen as well? What about the pseudonyms that you use when you
    comment on different forums on the web, or is the username that you created for
    that dating website your identity? What if those websites get hacked? If you suffer
    from dementia and forget your name, have you then lost your identity? If you are
    schizophrenic, do you have multiple identities? These are just some of the questions
    that come up when thinking about identity. But that is not all. Once you have
    identified who you are, we have to deal with the persistence of identity; which
    you is you? Is your identity who you are today, yesterday, or tomorrow? Is it
    your physical appearance, your perceived identity, your feelings and thoughts,
    or your actions? If you change your attitudes, behaviour, or even your physical
    body (your cells are replacing themselves constantly), does it change who you
    are? In addition, is your perceived identity different from your real identity?
    Your feelings about yourself and your characteristics might be perceived differently
    by you than by others. You might identity yourself as a shy, introverted person,
    whereas others view you as a confident and extraverted person. The way in which
    we perceive our identity, however, determines how we experience life—does this
    mean that it is part of your identity or is your identity how others see you?
    As hard as it may seem to answer this rather philosophical question in the analogue
    world, it seems a little bit easier to address in the digital world, as we shall
    see. Nevertheless, as you may have discovered by now, identity is a lot more complex
    than you might have thought, bearing in mind that we have not yet embarked on
    questions about group identity and all those devices that you can connect to the
    internet: do they have an identity as well? As it happens, they do, but we will
    get back to that in a bit.'

    perceived identity、你的情感和思想，还是你的行为？如果你改变了你的态度、行为，甚至你的生理特征（你的细胞在不断自我更新），这会改变你是谁吗？此外，你的
    perceived identity 是否与你的真实身份不同？你对自己的感觉和你的特质可能与你自己看待它们的方式不同。你可能认为自己是害羞、内向的人，而别人却认为你是自信、外向的人。然而，我们如何感知自己的身份决定了我们如何体验生活——这是否意味着它是你身份的一部分，还是你的身份是别人如何看待你？尽管在现实世界中回答这个相当哲学的问题可能看起来很困难，但在数字世界中，我们稍后会看到，这个问题似乎要容易一些。然而，正如你可能已经发现的那样，身份比你想象的要复杂得多，考虑到我们还没有开始讨论群体身份以及你可以连接到互联网的所有那些设备：它们也有身份吗？实际上，它们确实有，但我们会稍后再回到这个问题上。

    from a service that many of you have used and, if you did, you probably would
    not want that information to be made public. We are talking about Silk Road, an
    anonymous website on the dark web that was used to trade illicit goods and services,
    including drugs, weapons, and even murders for hire. It was named after the trading
    routes linking the East and the West in the 13th century and, as with the original
    Silk Road, trade was the main activity at the platform. However, when you are
    dealing with illegal goods and services, you are dealing with criminals who, by
    their nature, are difficult to trust. With trade, trust is vital, even among criminals.
    If you ordered some drugs on the platform you needed to be sure that you got what
    you ordered and the seller needs to be certain that he or she got paid. In order
    to solve this problem, Silk Road used a reputation system, an eBay-style, peer
    review system [113], which allowed buyers and sellers to review the other party,
    and their goods or services, before a transaction would take place. The system
    incentivised good behaviour, which worked remarkably well until Silk Road was
    shut down in October 2013\. In recent years, online reputation has gained traction
    and most of the well-known online services use some sort of reputation score:
    TripAdvisor rates hotels and destinations, Uber rates its passengers and drivers,
    AirBnB rates its hosts and guests, Netflix rates its movies and documentaries,
    Tinder rates its singles, and Glassdoor rates organisations. As such, reputation
    has become an important aspect of our lives, thereby incentivising good behaviour,

    does it do what it says it will do (for example, it communicates that it will
    overtake a car, but, if it does not do that, this could cause trouble on the road)?
    All these aspects make up the reputation of the car and the higher the reputation
    the more likely other devices, and humans, will want to deal with the machine.
    Would you like to enter a self-driving taxi with a very low reputation? Probably
    not. When machines start interacting with each other, for example as part of a
    smart grid, which we discuss in [Chapter 6](ch0006.xlink.xhtml), the price of,
    in this case a kilowatt, could go up or down based on the reputation of the device.
    Or to come back to the self-driving taxi example, a car with a very high reputation
    could become more expensive than a car with a lower reputation.'

    network economy in which we live, where people, organisations, and machines interact
    in a continuously changing network, is what we like to call shadow reputation.
    Within networks, reputation is made up by those with whom you interact (the people,
    companies, and machines, that is the actors in your network). Dealing with trustworthy
    actors increases your reputation and as such changes your identity. The opposite
    is also the case, dealing with untrustworthy actors, for example criminals, will
    negatively affect your reputation and as such your identity. You can compare this
    as ‘having the wrong friends’ and, when you become too closely linked to ‘the
    wrong friends’, it will directly affect how people view you and as such have an
    impact on your identity. This shadow reputation is intrinsically linked to who
    you are and how others identify you.

  zh: 身份的最后一个方面，由于我们所处的网络经济环境越来越重要，在这个环境中，人们、组织和机器在一个不断变化的网络中互动，我们称之为影子信誉。在网络中，信誉是由你与之互动的人（即你网络中的参与者，公司和个人机器）组成的。与值得信赖的参与者打交道可以提高你的信誉，从而改变你的身份。相反，如果与不可信的参与者打交道，例如罪犯，将负面影响你的信誉，从而影响你的身份。你可以将这比作“交错了朋友”，当你与“错误的朋友”过于紧密地联系在一起时，这将直接影响人们对你的看法，从而影响你的身份。这种影子信誉与你的本质和你如何被他人识别紧密相连。
- en: 'Shadow reputation not only influences people, but also affects organisations
    and machines, and is inherently connected to identity. An interesting example
    of this happened during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008\. Those people
    who worked at a bank at that time, and especially one of those banks that had
    to be bailed out, preferred not to talk about what they did and where they worked
    when they were at a party, because it would result in strange looks and difficult
    questions, and people would change their perception about them almost instantly.
    This is an example of shadow reputation: where the negative reputation of the
    bank at that time directly influenced how people perceived the bank’s employees.
    Of course, what goes for people and organisations also goes for machines. If too
    many machines within a smart grid have a bad reputation, the reputation of the
    smart grid will go down. Or if a machine is connected to a machine infected with
    malware, it will directly affect the reputation of that device.'

    other actors in your network that influence your reputation while you interact
    with them. The concepts of attributes, reputation, and shadow reputation are forever
    linked to identity and with the Blockchain they will become immutable, traceable,

    current identity system that we have developed with each other. Our global identity
    system was developed in and for an analogue world and, although we have entered
    the digital world, our identity systems have not yet followed. The existing problems
    with identity relate to security (personal identifiable information is scattered
    around thousands of, often insecure, databases) and routines (the hotel where
    you are staying making a copy of your passport) resulting in the relative ease
    with which an identity can be stolen. In addition, with identity still residing
    in the analogue world, verification of identities is expensive and difficult and
    can easily result in flaws. On the other hand, online identity verification is
    hopelessly outdated, with many websites still allowing passwords such as abcd1234
    or password. Offline verification, meanwhile, requires all kinds of additional
    personal identifiable information, which are not relevant but, as there is no
    other way, inevitable. For example, when purchasing alcohol at a shop, your name
    really is not relevant to determining whether you are legally allowed to buy alcohol.
    Finally, the biggest challenge of them all is the 1.5 billion people without a
    proper identity, who as a result of this do not have access to banking, job security,
    education, and other human rights. If we wish to solve some of the Wicked Problems
    as discussed in this book, all humans should have a personal, verifiable identity.

    and time-consuming task, involving multiple documents from a variety of organisations,
    as well as verification questions to prove who you are. Verifying your identity
    happens all the time, online and offline. ‘In the physical world, there are fairly
    accepted ways to verify who you are, like a driver’s licence or a passport’, says
    Cameron Gough, digital delivery centre general manager at Australia Post. ‘But
    in the digital world we don’t have this. So, . . . organisations have a trade-off
    between fraud and friction, and convenience. They would love to decrease the level
    of fraud but usually the mechanisms available to do that result in an increase
    in inconvenience or friction for customers’ [123]. Organisations such as banks,
    telcos, social media websites, or online retailers need to verify your identity
    when you want to do business with them, often because of regulation such as Know
    Your Customer or Client (KYC). KYC is the process that financial institutions,
    in particular, need to have in place in order to verify the identity of customers
    to prevent money-laundering activities or even financing of terrorism. It consists
    of multiple checks and the production of specific documents. Every time you open
    up an account at a new bank, you will have to go through the same process again,
    even if you have already been verified by a different institution. KYC requires
    the financial institutions to know who you are and what your activities are, and
    to assess money-laundering risks [124]. However, banks are not the only institutions
    that employ KYC; other companies use it to make sure that they deal with legitimate
    persons or companies. In recent years, KYC has been expanded to KYCC, or Know
    Your Customer’s or Client’s Customer or Client. It takes the KYC requirements
    to a higher level, because it requires knowledge of whom your customers are dealing
    with, what their sources of funds are, and their risk of money laundering. The
    only way to comply is to demand proof of the legitimacy of the funds and transactions.
    As a result, as of 11 May 2018 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Final Rule will come
    into effect in the USA. In June 2017, the 4th AML Directive went into effect in
    Europe. Both regulations require companies to continuously monitor customers and
    customers’ customers to mitigate suspicious transactions, risks, and financial
    crime [125]. As you can imagine, complying with these regulations will be time-consuming
    and expensive, although not complying can be a lot more expensive due to heavy
    fines and reputational harm.

  zh: 验证您的身份可能简单到只需出示身份证，也可能是一项繁琐且耗时的工作，这需要从各种组织中提供多种文件，以及回答验证问题来证明您的身份。身份验证无论是在线上还是线下都在不断发生。澳大利亚邮政数字交付中心总经理Cameron
    Gough说：“在物理世界中，验证你是谁有相当被接受的方法，比如驾驶执照或护照。’但在数字世界中我们没有这些。所以，组织在欺诈、摩擦和便利性之间做出权衡。他们希望能降低欺诈水平，但通常实现这一目标的方法会导致客户的不便或摩擦增加’
    [123]。银行、电信公司、社交媒体网站或在线零售商等组织在你与他们进行交易时需要验证你的身份，通常是因为需要遵守诸如了解你的客户或客户（KYC）等规定。KYC是金融机构特别需要执行的过程，以防止洗钱活动甚至资助恐怖主义。它包括多项检查和特定文件的提交。每次你在一家新银行开户时，你都必须再次经历同样的过程，即使你已经由不同的机构验证过。KYC要求金融机构了解你的身份和活动，并评估洗钱风险
    [124]。然而，采用KYC的金融机构并非唯一；其他公司也使用它来确保他们与合法的个人或公司交易。近年来，KYC已经扩展到KYCC，即了解你的客户或客户的客户或客户。这把KYC的要求提升到了更高的水平，因为它需要知道你的客户在与谁交易，他们的资金来源以及洗钱风险。遵守的唯一方法是要求证明资金和交易的合法性。因此，截至2018年5月11日，美国将实施客户尽职调查（CDD）最终规则。2017年6月，第四版反洗钱指令在欧盟生效。这两个规定都要求公司持续监控客户及其客户，以减轻可疑交易、风险和金融犯罪

    ease with which identity can be faked or purchased. For example, the price of
    a fake US passport on the dark web starts at just $US938 [126]. In addition, the
    more companies have to store customer and customers’ customer data, the higher
    the risks become that such data will be stolen by hackers, because not all companies
    will ensure the highest level of security. At the same time, people constantly
    have to provide their details on the web and remember details such as usernames

    developing and executing proper social services. According to [ID2020.org](http://ID2020.org),
    a public/private partnership for solving the problem of identity exclusion, over
    100 countries do not have functional civil registration and vital statistics systems
    [127]. As a result, approximately 230 million children are not registered at birth
    and as such officially do not exist. Not having accurate population statistics
    prevents business, governments, and non-government organisations (NGOs) from conducting
    frictionless business. It precludes proper planning and budgeting if you do not
    know who and how many people you are dealing with. For countries that already
    face multiple other Wicked Problems, this poses a real challenge and solving those
    challenges often starts with solving the identity problem. Only people who have
    proof of their identity can open a bank account, vote, and participate in the
    economy, thereby stimulating the economy and creating a better world for themselves
    and the country as a whole.

- en: One country that is working hard on giving all their citizens an identity is
    India. In 2009 the government launched the project AadHaar, which is the world’s
    largest biometric identity system. The objective of the system is to provide every
    Indian with a government-issued identity card, linked to their biometric details
    and with a 12-digit number based on their biometrics and demographics. As of April
    2017, 1.133 billion people had been enrolled, or 99% of Indian citizens aged over
    18 years. It is the world’s most sophisticated identity platform and has a capacity
    to enrol 1 million people per day [128]. This proof of identity enables Indian
    citizens to have easy, online, and portable access to government services, and
    the system is linked, through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), with
    other, non-governmental services such as banks. As such, it enables those organisations
    to comply with KYC. AadHaar is a great example of how a government brought their
    identity system into the 21st century, although, as is always the case with projects
    of this scale, various parties have their concerns about whether the design is
    secure and private.

    Blockchain and as such all the problems that currently exist with identity still
    remain. Blockchain offers enormous potential to solve our identity crisis. Having
    ‘an identity on the Blockchain’ will make it immutable, traceable, and verifiable,
    thereby significantly reducing the possibilities for identity theft, making identity
    verification seamless, and giving power back to the user. Building a digital identity
    on the Blockchain would act as a digital watermark, similar to the way that traditional
    identity documents such as passports have a watermark to verify the document’s
    authenticity [129]. This digital watermark then enables any organisation with
    access to the Blockchain to check identity on every transaction, in real time.
    If you can check someone’s identity on every transaction, this would eliminate
    the possibility of fraud. As such, enabling identity on the Blockchain is a $US4.2
    trillion opportunity, that is the global annual cost of fraud, according to research
    from the University of Portsmouth [129]. Contrary to today, verification of someone’s
    identity would be at almost no cost, because the customer would simply ‘lend’
    their digital identity when necessary, without revealing any information that
    is not necessary for that particular transaction.

  zh: 尽管AadHaar是为21世纪构建的，但它并不是基于区块链，因此所有目前与身份相关的问题仍然存在。区块链为我们解决身份危机提供了巨大的潜力。拥有“区块链上的身份”将使它不可变、可追溯和可验证，从而显著减少身份盗窃的可能性，使身份验证无缝，并将权力归还给用户。在区块链上建立数字身份将起到数字水印的作用，就像传统身份证明文件如护照有水印以验证文件的真实性[129]。这个数字水印然后使任何有权访问区块链的组织能够在每次交易中实时检查身份。如果你能在每次交易中检查某人的身份，这将消除欺诈的可能性。因此，启用区块链上的身份是一个价值4.2万亿美元的机会，这是根据朴次茅斯大学的研究[129]得出的全球每年欺诈成本。与今天相反，验证某人的身份几乎不需要任何成本，因为客户在需要时只需“借用”他们的数字身份，而不透露任何对该特定交易不必要的信息。
- en: However, before we delve further into this topic, the first thing we need to
    make clear is that putting your identity on the Blockchain does not mean putting
    personal identifiable information, such as your passport, social security number,
    or any other attribute, on the Blockchain. Blockchain is used to manage keys,
    anchor data records in time, and make them immutable, as well as to discover those
    records when necessary. It is, and should never be, used to store personal identifiable
    information and the reason is simple. Linking personal identifiable information
    to, for example, coins means that information will remain there indefinitely and
    becomes always traceable. If you were to do so, it would mean that you would use
    one or only a few coins to link those attributes, which would immediately expose
    it to discovery of correlations among them, even if you would not be able to decrypt
    the data. In addition, as we already established earlier, your attributes constantly
    evolve over time, so that is not something that you should want to be immutable
    because attributes that are legal today can become illegal tomorrow. Instead,
    if we want to put identity on the Blockchain, we should remove all data related
    to the person and store only the token on the Blockchain, and allow the user to
    store their personal identifiable information on their own device of choice, which
    will probably be a smartphone or something of that sort. As a result, consumers
    will get back control of their own identity. Meanwhile, attributes scattered across
    thousands of databases will become a thing of the past and the unidentified can
    obtain a digital identity, simply by collecting and controlling their attributes,
    reputation, and shadow reputation using a blockchain.

  zh: 然而，在我们更深入地探讨这个话题之前，我们需要明确的第一件事是，将你的身份放在区块链上，并不意味着要把个人可识别信息，比如你的护照、社会保障号码或其他任何属性，放在区块链上。区块链是用来管理密钥，将数据记录固定在时间上，使它们不可变，以及在需要时发现这些记录。它，而且永远不应该被用来存储个人可识别信息，原因很简单。将个人可识别信息，例如货币，与之关联意味着这些信息将永远留在那里，并且可以被追踪。如果你这样做，意味着你用一个或只有几个货币来关联这些属性，这会立即暴露出它们之间的相关性，即使你无法解密数据。此外，如我们之前所建立的，你的属性随着时间的推移不断变化，所以那不是你想让它不可变的事情，因为今天合法的属性可能明天就变成非法的。相反，如果我们想将身份放在区块链上，我们应该删除与个人相关的所有数据，只把代币放在区块链上，并允许用户将他们的个人可识别信息存储在他们选择的设备上，这可能是一部智能手机或类似的东西。因此，消费者将重新获得对自己身份的控制权。与此同时，散布在成千上万个数据库中的属性将成为过去，而匿名者仅通过收集和使用区块链上的属性和声誉（包括不良声誉），就能获得数字身份。
- en: How does that work? In order to explain this we first need to clarify something
    about Public Key Infrastructure, because it is intrinsically linked to identity
    on the Blockchain and, to do so, we have to go back in time to the 1970s. In 1976,
    two Stanford mathematicians, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, discovered an
    advanced mathematical relationship called asymmetric cryptography. They identified
    a relationship between large prime numbers, where data encrypted with one key,
    could be decrypted by its paired key. At the same time, in 1978, three other mathematicians
    named Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman identified the same relationship
    and published it as the RSA algorithm [130]. They were able to monetise this algorithm
    and build a company around it (RSA Corporation), which was eventually sold to
    EMC and now belongs to Dell.

  zh: 这是如何运作的呢？为了解释这个问题，我们首先需要澄清关于公钥基础设施（Public Key Infrastructure，PKI）的某些方面，因为它与区块链上的身份紧密相关，为此，我们必须回溯到1970年代。1976年，两名斯坦福大学的数学家，惠特菲尔德·迪菲（Whitfield
    Diffie）和马丁·赫尔曼（Martin Hellman），发现了一种先进的数学关系，称为非对称加密。他们识别了大数据素数之间的一种关系，其中用一个密钥加密的数据可以用它的配对密钥解密。与此同时，1978年，另外三名数学家，罗恩·里维斯特（Ron
    Rivest）、阿迪·沙米尔（Adi Shamir）和伦纳德·阿德曼（Leonard Adleman）也识别了同样的关系，并将其作为RSA算法[130]发表。他们能够将这个算法货币化，围绕这个算法建立了一家公司（RSA公司），该公司最终被EMC收购，现在属于戴尔。
- en: 'Asymmetric cryptography means that two keys, a public and a private key, are
    mathematically related to each other. This relationship means that any data encrypted
    by one key (public key) can be decrypted only by the other (private key) and vice
    versa. It is impossible to encrypt data with a public key and use another public
    key to decrypt that data [49]. As a result, you can use a key pair to identify
    the owner of a certain digital asset. As the public key is publically available,
    any data encrypted with a related private key can be decrypted only by the corresponding
    public key. Hence, if Alice encrypts a file with her private key and sends it
    to Bob, who uses the corresponding public key, he can be certain that Alice was
    the one who encrypted the file. The other way is also possible: if Bob wants to
    send Alice a private message, he encrypts the file with the public key that is
    mathematically linked to Alice’s private key. If Alice receives the message, she
    is the only one who can open the message using her private key. Therefore, it
    is vital that she keeps her private key really private. It works like a mailbox,
    where everyone has a key to deposit a letter to that mailbox, but only one person
    has the right key to open the mailbox and take the mail out.'

  zh: 非对称加密意味着存在一对密钥，即公钥和私钥，它们在数学上相互关联。这种关联意味着任何使用一个密钥（公钥）加密的数据只能用另一个密钥（私钥）解密，反之亦然。使用公钥加密数据，然后用另一个公钥来解密数据是不可能的[49]。因此，你可以使用密钥对来标识某个数字资产的所有者。由于公钥是公开可用的，任何用相关私钥加密的数据只能用对应的公钥解密。所以，如果爱丽丝用她的私钥加密一个文件并发送给鲍勃，鲍勃使用相应的公钥，他可以确信爱丽丝是加密文件的人。反之亦然：如果鲍勃想给爱丽丝发送一条私信，他可以用与爱丽丝的私钥在数学上关联的公钥来加密文件。如果爱丽丝收到消息，她将是唯一一个能用她的私钥打开消息的人。因此，她必须确保她的私钥保持绝对私密。这就像一个邮箱，每个人都有权利将信件放入这个邮箱，但只有一个人有权利用正确的钥匙打开邮箱并取出信件。
- en: Since then, Public Key Infrastructure has been widely deployed. Almost anything
    that you do online uses the Public Key Infrastructure, from sending emails to
    visiting websites (a website is encrypted using the Public Key Infrastructure
    if it has an SSL certificate and the website shows https). It means that we can
    be certain that the data that is sent between the user and the server is not interrupted.
    Public Private Key Infrastructure is also used to ensure authenticity of a certain
    document. This is done using the Hash Algorithm as discussed in [Chapter 2](ch0002.xlink.xhtml).
    Hash Algorithms are special mathematical formulae that will turn any input into
    a unique fixed-length output of numbers and letters. Changing the input will completely
    change the output. If you want to secure a message or data file, you hash the
    data and then encrypt it using the Public Key Infrastructure. As a result, the
    identity of the sender can be proved and the authenticity of the data file verified,
    revealing whether or not the file has been tampered with. In the traditional and
    centralised internet, Public Key Infrastructure relies on centralised trusted
    third parties, called Certificate Authorities (CAs). These CAs issue, revoke,
    and restore the key pairs, for every stakeholder involved. Apart from the fact
    that these are centralised companies exerting a lot of control, hackers can potentially
    spoof user identities, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and thereby intercept
    communications [131]. As of May 2017, there are several research projects working
    on decentralised version of the Public Key Infrastructure, each taking a slightly
    different approach. Of course, there is a lot more to cryptography in terms of
    technicalities, but this is enough to know. The combination of Public Key Infrastructure
    and Hash Algorithms is used extensively on the Blockchain and is, more or less,
    what enables identity on the Blockchain.

  zh: 自那时起，公钥基础设施（PKI）已被广泛部署。几乎你在网上做的任何事情都使用到了公钥基础设施，从发送电子邮件到访问网站（如果一个网站拥有SSL证书并且显示https，那么它就是使用公钥基础设施进行加密的）。这意味着我们可以确信，在用户和服务器之间传输的数据不会被中断。公私钥基础设施还用于确保某些文档的真实性。这是通过使用散列算法来完成的，具体内容在[第二章](ch0002.xlink.xhtml)有所讨论。散列算法是一种特殊的数学公式，它可以将任何输入转换成固定长度的数字和字母的输出。改变输入将会完全改变输出。如果你想保护一条信息或数据文件，你会对数据进行散列处理，然后使用公钥基础设施进行加密。结果是，可以证明发送者的身份，并验证数据文件的真实性，从而揭示文件是否被篡改。在传统的集中式互联网中，公钥基础设施依赖于被称为证书授权中心（CAs）的集中式可信第三方。这些CAs为每个参与方颁发、吊销和恢复密钥对。除了这些是行使大量控制的集中式公司之外，黑客还可能伪造用户身份，执行中间人攻击，从而拦截通信[131]。截至2017年5月，有几个研究项目正在研究公钥基础设施的去中心化版本，每个项目都采取了略有不同的方法。当然，在技术细节上，密码学还有更多的内容，但这是需要了解的。公钥基础设施和散列算法的结合在区块链上被广泛使用，并且在某种程度上，这使得区块链上的身份成为可能。
- en: Another concept that we need to cover is tokenisation, before we can tie it
    all together. Every Blockchain uses tokens to help validate transactions and create
    the blocks, which are subsequently chained together. A token on a blockchain can
    mean several things. Either they are referred to currency tokens, such as bitcoin
    (BTC), or they are referred to asset tokens. Currency tokens are the most well-known
    tokens, simply because the first crypto token ever, Bitcoin, is a currency token.
    A currency token is a medium of value exchange, and the value of the token is
    determined by supply and demand. Contrary to fiat money, which is backed by gold,
    currency tokens are only backed by the demand in the market. The other type of
    token is ‘Asset Tokens’, which are claims to an underlying asset that belongs
    to a certain issuer or user. They can be best compared with an ‘I Owe You’ (IOU)
    when you, for example in the old days, could bring gold to a goldsmith who would
    write an IOU, which you could then trade. Anyone who owns that IOU could go to
    the goldsmith and trade it for the original gold. Asset-backed tokens are the
    digital equivalent of an IOU and it enables you to track a certain asset as it
    moves from person to person. Once you have ‘tokenised’ an asset (either tangible
    or digital), you can track its movements. New digital tokens are created every
    day to track new assets from diamonds to music to art. Asset-backed tokens can
    be traded and eventually someone can trade it back to the original asset [132].
    Apart from physical items such as paintings or digital assets such as music, you
    can also tokenise an identity attribute, since it is also an asset, albeit an
    intangible one. However, instead of transferring the token from person to person,
    you ‘lend’ it to the other party and retain ownership of the token. We also have
    security tokens and utility tokens. A security token is a token that allows the
    owner of that token a (future) stake in a company, while a utility token is a
    token that has a use case and has not been developed as an investment. Most of
    today’s Blockchain startups aim to develop their token as a use case.

  zh: 我们需要介绍的另一个概念是令牌化，在我们能够将其全部联系起来之前。每个区块链都使用令牌来帮助验证交易并创建区块，随后将这些区块链接起来。区块链上的令牌可以意味着几件事情。要么它们指的是货币令牌，比如比特币（BTC），要么它们指的是资产令牌。货币令牌是最著名的令牌，原因很简单，因为第一个加密货币令牌，比特币，就是一种货币令牌。货币令牌是一种价值交换媒介，其价值由供求关系决定。与由黄金支持的法定货币相反，货币令牌只由市场需求支撑。另一种令牌是“资产令牌”，它是对属于某个发行者或用户的底层资产的索赔。它们可以与“我欠你”（IOU）相比较，例如在旧时代，你可以拿黄金去金匠那里，金匠会写一张IOU，你就可以用它进行交易。任何拥有那张IOU的人都可以去找金匠，用它换回原始的黄金。资产支持的令牌是IOU的数字等价物，它允许你跟踪某项资产是如何从一个人转移到另一个人的。一旦你对一项资产进行了“令牌化”（无论是实体资产还是数字资产），你就可以追踪它的移动。每天都有新的数字令牌被创建出来，用于追踪从钻石到音乐到艺术的新资产。资产支持的令牌可以被交易，最终有人可以将其交易回原始资产[132]。除了画作等物理物品或音乐等数字资产，你还可以对一个身份属性进行令牌化，因为它也是一种资产，尽管是无形的。然而，不同于将令牌从一个人转移到另一个人，你将其“借”给另一方并保留令牌的所有权。我们还有安全令牌和实用令牌。安全令牌是一种允许令牌所有者拥有公司（未来）股份的令牌，而实用令牌是一种有使用案例且尚未被开发为投资的令牌。当今大多数区块链初创公司都旨在将它们的令牌作为使用案例来发展。

    only one or two seconds. Enabling identity on the Blockchain ensures that the
    user, Alice, remains in full control of who receives what information about her
    and her identity remains protected. This is called a self-sovereign identity.
    Even if hackers were to steal all Key Value pairs from Gov, the information would
    be useless because they cannot link it to persons, so there is no problem with
    storing the information in a public ledger. In addition, whether Alice is a person
    or a Thing really does not matter. The connected device performs the same actions
    as Alice would do. As such, identity on the Blockchain has many advantages, which
    we turn to next.

    intermediary and makes peer-to-peer transactions possible. When Blockchain is
    applied to the financial services industry, it could render obsolete the fee-charging
    intermediaries such as custodian banks (those that transfer money between different
    banks) or clearing houses (those vouching for counterparty’s credit positions).
    As such, Blockchain offers better capital optimisation, due to a significant reduction
    in operational costs for banks. In addition, when banks share a Blockchain, the
    total costs of that Blockchain and the surrounding ecosystem might be higher than
    the individual costs of managing transactions at a bank. However, the costs are
    shared among all participating banks so there is a significant cost reduction.
    Finally, according to research by Accenture, financial reporting costs could drop
    70% due to optimised data quality, transparency, and internal controls. Compliance
    costs could drop 30–50% due to transparency and better auditability of transactions,
    as well as improved and more efficient KYC processes. Finally, business operation
    costs could drop 50% due to the reduction and removal of unnecessary processes
    [134]. When transactions are settled almost instantly, it removes a significant
    part of the risk of a counterparty not meeting its obligations (otherwise a substantial
    expense for banks).

    data with Blockchain, including Google’s DeepMind, which seems very promising.
    In March 2017, Google announced that they wanted to apply their advanced deep
    learning technology to UK healthcare data to enable patients, doctors, hospitals,
    and the National Health Service, combined with blockchain technology, to track
    personal healthcare data [137]. According to DeepMind co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman,
    this has been called ‘Verifiable Data Audit’ and it will ‘record the fact that
    a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why, for example,
    that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm to detect
    possible acute kidney injury’ [138]. They are building an auditing system for
    healthcare data [139]. As a result, any access of and changes made to the patient’s
    data are immediately visible and can be tracked by the system. Contrary to public
    blockchains (such as the bitcoin blockchain), the distributed ledger that will
    be used provides access only to trusted stakeholders such as hospitals and national
    institutions for verification of the integrity of the ledgers. However, the result
    is the same: any entry to the ledger is immutable, verifiable, and traceable by
    those with access to the ledger. The system could become a federated patient-identified
    information database that allows relevant stakeholders to perform valuable research
    to create better healthcare, without breaching patient privacy. Instead, it puts
    humans back in control of their healthcare data. Imagine the possibilities, when
    the system that DeepMind is developing is combined with a global self-sovereign
    identity system? This would mean that you would carry your own digital healthcare
    records across the globe, in a secure and private way. Whenever you need healthcare,
    anywhere in the world, you could provide local caregivers with secure access to
    your relevant healthcare data, ensuring that you have the best possible care.
    When you get home, your own doctor can see exactly what happened, what treatment
    was given and any testing or analysis conducted by the treating physician. This

    Suleyman的说法，这被称为“可验证数据审计”，它将“记录某一特定数据已被使用的事实，以及原因，例如，那次血液测试数据是如何与国家健康服务（NHS）的国家算法相匹配以检测可能的急性肾损伤的”[138]。他们正在为医疗数据建立一个审计系统[139]。因此，对患者数据的任何访问和更改都是立即可见的，并且可以被系统追踪。与公共区块链（如比特币区块链）不同，将要使用的分布式账本只提供给可信的利益相关方（如医院和国家机构）访问，以验证账本的一致性。然而，结果是一样的：账本上的任何条目都是不可变的、可验证的，并且可以被有权访问账本的人追踪。该系统可能成为一个联合的患者标识信息数据库，允许相关利益相关方进行有价值的研究，以创造更好的医疗保健，而不侵犯患者隐私。相反，它将人类置于他们医疗数据的控制之下。想象一下，当DeepMind正在开发的系统与一个全球自我主权身份系统相结合时，可能的潜力吧？这意味着你将能够带着你自己的数字医疗记录在全球范围内安全、私密地携带。无论你在世界何处需要医疗保健，你都可以向当地的护理人员提供对你相关医疗数据的安全访问，确保你获得最好的护理。当你回到家时，你的医生可以看到确切发生了什么，给予了什么治疗以及治疗医生进行的任何测试或分析。这将极大地改善医疗保健，降低成本，更重要的是，拯救生命。

  zh: 爱沙尼亚并不是唯一一个看到区块链政府巨大潜力的国家。2017年，迪拜宣布将开发首个基于区块链的城市。尽管爱沙尼亚领先于迪拜，但迪拜的目标是在2020年实现他们大胆的愿景。他们的愿景是成为世界上最幸福的城市，并在数字世界中排名第一。到2020年，他们计划将所有政府服务和交易转移到区块链上，使它们不可篡改、可追溯和可验证，同时减少官僚主义和不效率。没有官僚主义和高效的政府服务当然有助于实现这一愿景，尽管他们仍然任重道远。
- en: In order to achieve their vision, Dubai has developed a public–private partnership
    called Smarter Dubai. This is a citywide effort to implement Blockchain across
    the city for a multitude of services. The objective is for collaboration of government,
    semi-government, and commercial organisations to speed up the development of blockchain
    applications in the Emirate city. They have partnered with IBM and ConsenSys to
    guide them in this objective. As with any ambitious project in Dubai, they have
    pledged investment of millions and already the first blockchain services have
    come into being. For example, the Department of Economic Development is moving
    its entire processes of business registration and licensing services to Blockchain.
    In addition, Dubai’s largest bank, the NBD, is developing a smart contracts platform
    to reduce complex documentation for moving, shipping, and tracking of goods [140].

  zh: 为了实现他们的愿景，迪拜开发了一个名为Smarter Dubai的公私合作伙伴关系。这是一个旨在将区块链应用于城市多种服务的全市性努力。目标是政府、半政府和商业组织的合作，加快在酋长国城市中区块链应用的发展。他们与IBM和ConsenSys合作，指导他们实现这一目标。与迪拜的任何雄心勃勃的项目一样，他们承诺投资数百万，并且首批区块链服务已经问世。例如，经济发展部正在将其企业注册和许可服务的整个流程转移到区块链上。此外，迪拜最大的银行NBD正在开发一个智能合约平台，以减少商品转移、运输和跟踪的复杂文件。
- en: In the coming years, we will probably see more governments that move to the
    Blockchain and develop identity solutions on it. As a result, we will see governments
    start to compete for the best companies, not based on tax benefits, but on the
    efficiency gains that can be achieved. This will change the playing field and
    those governments that focus on an open, inclusive, e-identity system, connecting
    government and commercial services using Blockchain, will be in the best position
    to win.

  zh: 在未来几年，我们可能会看到更多政府转移到区块链并在此基础上开发身份解决方案。因此，我们将看到政府开始为最佳公司竞争，而不是基于税收优惠，而是基于可以实现的效率提升。这将改变竞技场，那些专注于开放、包容的电子身份系统、使用区块链连接政府和商业服务的政府将处于最有利的位置赢得胜利。

- en: 'Identity is the combination of many different attributes, constantly changing
    over time, and linked to your reputation, that is how trustworthy you are, as
    well as your shadow reputation (who you are dealing with). It is not only humans
    that have identities. Organisations and many things are also uniquely identifiable.
    With the rise of the Internet of Things, which will connect billions of devices
    and trillions of sensors, an upgrade to our identity system is long overdue. Our
    existing identity system has some serious flaws: identity theft is commonplace,
    costing us billions of dollars and leaving victims traumatised; identity verification
    is expensive and a hassle, seriously breaching our privacy, and millions of people
    are excluded from obtaining a government-issued proof of identity, leaving them
    vulnerable and without access to basic services. However, we can bring identity
    to the 21st century by creating a digital identity, a self-sovereign identity,
    that uses distributed ledgers to make identity data immutable, verifiable, and
    traceable. A self-sovereign identity can be described according to the 5Ps; personal,
    private, persistent, protected, and portable. It uses tokenisation as well as
    encryption with the Public Key Infrastructure to prevent identity theft, improve
    identity verification, and help those who are excluded by giving them a digital
    identity. Those who are excluded can use different personal data traits and digital
    social connections to verify who they are, simply by using an App installed on
    their phone [141]. Once they have been verified, it will enable them to open bank
    accounts, apply as a refugee, and apply for many more services that will improve
    their lives. Of course, it is vital that personal identifiable information is
    never as it is put on a blockchain. Putting an address, biometric data, or even
    a passport on a blockchain is a serious privacy risk, which is why tokenisation
    is so important. Once we solve the Wicked Problem of identity and create digital
    identities that bring control back to the individual, this offers us a chance
    to solve some of the other Wicked Problems. Therefore, in the next chapter, we
    explore this more closely and see how Blockchain can contribute towards ending
    poverty forever.'

  zh: 身份是由许多不同的属性组合而成，随着时间的推移不断变化，并与你的声誉相关联，即你的可信度，以及你的暗声誉（你正在与之交易的人）。不仅仅是人类拥有身份。组织和许多事物也是唯一可识别的。随着物联网的兴起，将连接数十亿设备和数万亿美元传感器，我们的身份系统升级已经刻不容缓。我们现有的身份系统存在一些严重缺陷：身份盗窃司空见惯，造成我们数十亿美元的损失，受害者深受创伤；身份验证成本高昂，手续繁琐，严重侵犯我们的隐私，数百万人被排除在获取政府发行的身份证明之外，使他们陷入脆弱和无法获得基本服务的境地。然而，我们可以通过创建一个使用分布式账本使身份数据不可变、可验证和可追溯的数字身份和自主身份，将身份带入21世纪。自主身份可以根据5Ps来描述；个人、私人、持久、受保护、可携带。它使用代币化以及公钥基础设施的加密，以防止身份盗窃，改进身份验证，并帮助被排除在外的人赋予他们数字身份。被排除的人可以使用不同的个人数据特征和数字社交连接来验证他们的身份，只需使用安装在手机上的App即可[141]。一旦他们得到验证，它将使他们能够开设银行账户，申请难民，并申请许多其他将改善他们生活的服务。当然，确保个人可识别信息永远不会像它放在区块链上那样至关重要。将地址、生物识别数据甚至护照放在区块链上是一个严重的隐私风险，这就是代币化如此重要的原因。一旦我们解决了身份的棘手问题并创建了使控制权回归个体的数字身份，这为我们解决其他棘手问题提供了一个机会。因此，在下一章中，我们深入探讨这一点，并看看区块链如何有助于永远结束贫困。
- en: Despite the enormous potential of a self-sovereign identity for any industry,
    there are still some major challenges ahead of us. These challenges include ensuring
    global adoption, scalability, and governance, as well as compliance with local
    regulations and jurisdictions. Nevertheless, a number of players (including the
    financial services industry, healthcare, and some governments) are already working
    on developing a digital identity and/or self-sovereign identity, and it seems
    we are indeed at the forefront of an identity revolution.
