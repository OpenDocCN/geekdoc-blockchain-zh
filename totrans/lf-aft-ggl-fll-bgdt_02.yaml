    in his system of the world, was what most critically differentiated the long millennia
    of economic doldrums that preceded him from the three hundred years of miraculous
    growth since his death. The failure of his alchemy gave him—and the world—precious
    knowledge that no rival state or private bank, wielding whatever philosopher’s
    stone, would succeed in making a better money. For two hundred years, beginning
    with Newton’s appointment to the Royal Mint in 1696, the pound, based on the chemical
    irreversibility of gold, was a stable and reliable monetary Polaris.[⁵](notes.html#ch02note-5)

    projects, new technologies—without fearing that inflation fueled by counterfeit

    Gödel showed in his paper—even the canonical system enshrined in the Principia
    Mathematica of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, even the set theory
    of Carnap and von Neumann—were fated to incompleteness and inconsistency. They
    necessarily harbored paradoxes and aporias. Mere consistency of a formal system

    of logic—the futility of Hilbert’s quest for a hermetically sealed universal theory—would
    emancipate human creators, the programmers of their machines. As the philosopher
    William Briggs observes, “Gödel proved that axiomatizing never stops, that induction-intuition
    must always be present, that not all things can be proved by reason alone.”[⁹](notes.html#ch02note-9)
    This recognition would liberate von Neumann himself. Not only could men discover
    algorithms, they could compose them. The new vision ultimately led to a new information
    theory of biology, anticipated in principle by von Neumann and developed most
