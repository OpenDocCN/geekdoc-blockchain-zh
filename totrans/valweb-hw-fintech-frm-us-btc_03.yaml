    value person-to-person, peer-to-peer (P2P), between anyone on the planet, things

    Every mobile telephone can be a point of purchase and a point of sale. That means

    expenses were around $1.47 million, while revenues were less than one million.

    value of bitcoins and did not know how to handle the rapid loss of bitcoin value,

    they have invented *money without government,* and believe that society should
    be free to operate as it wants. If people want to exchange drugs, paedophilia
    or organise terrorist activities, that is a lifestyle choice and they should be
    allowed to do just that. They hold that if these activities are disapproved of
    by the majority, then the collective will shut it down rather than the government.

  zh: 这是一个引人入胜的故事，展示了自由主义者与国家主义者的对峙。自由主义者与国家主义者的冲突非常激烈，并且对于那些尚未遇到的人来说，由许多比特币活动人士领导。比特币活动人士声称他们发明了*无需政府的货币*，并且认为社会应该自由运作。如果人们想要交换毒品、恋童癖或者组织恐怖活动，那就是一种生活方式选择，他们应该被允许这样做。他们认为，如果这些活动受到大多数人的反对，那么集体意愿会关闭它，而不是政府。

    of allowing terrorist funding, child pornography or drugs to be freely traded
    through the net is undesirable for most. Nevertheless, the libertarians have a

  zh: 很明显，我们中的一些人会将这视为一个极端的立场，因为允许恐怖分子资助、儿童色情或毒品通过网络自由交易的事实对大多数人来说都是不可取的。尽管如此，自由主义者有自己的观点。
- en: 'Ross Ulbricht was a libertarian. Therefore, Silk Road was created as a service
    unconstrained by statist intervention and completely impervious to interference,
    since it was totally anonymous. Or so he thought. So how did he get arrested,
    jailed and given five sentences—including two for life—to be served concurrently
    with no chance of parole? There were two key factors that led to Ulbricht’s arrest:
    perseverance and arrogance.'

  zh: 罗斯·乌尔布里希特是一个自由主义者。因此，丝绸之路被创建为一个不受国家干预限制、完全不受干扰的服务，因为它是完全匿名的。或者他这样认为。那么他是如何被逮捕、监禁并被判五个刑期——其中包括两个无可挽回的终身监禁，而且无假释机会呢？导致乌尔布里希特被捕的有两个关键因素：毅力和傲慢。
- en: Perseverance is best illustrated by the Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) Special
    Agent Carl Mark Force IV, who spent over a year developing access to Ulbricht
    through the torrent chat rooms.

  zh: 毅力最好由缉毒局（DEA）的特工卡尔·马克·福斯特四世来说明，他花了一年多的时间通过种子聊天室开发对乌尔布里希特的接触。
- en: The second aspect is the arrogance of Ulbricht. For example, a year before his
    arrest he was warned that Silk Road’s IP address was leaked, and visible to other
    computers—which gave the DEA their big break. From that IP address, they found
    the server and from that server, all the communications across the Silk Road community.

  zh: 第二个方面是乌尔布里希特的傲慢。例如，在他被捕的一年前，有人警告他丝绸之路的IP地址泄露了，可以被其他计算机看到——这给了缉毒局一个重大突破。从那个IP地址，他们找到了服务器，从那个服务器，找到了丝绸之路社区的所有通讯。
- en: 'And there’s the rub: if Ulbricht had been a more professional programmer and
    less arrogant, Silk Road would probably still be running today. Torrent or, in
    short form, Tor technologies, are completely anonymous and bitcoin payments cannot
    be traced easily through Tor.'

  zh: 这就是问题所在：如果乌尔布里希特是一个更专业的程序员，更少一些傲慢，丝绸之路今天可能仍然在运行。种子技术，或者简称为Tor技术，是完全匿名的，而且比特币支付在Tor上很难被追踪。

- en: Tor—The Onion Router—was a software infrastructure developed by the US Navy
    in the 1990s, with the aim of protecting US intelligence communications online.
    After its release and subsequent enhancements since 2002, it’s become the preferred
    network for drugs, fraud and other illicit activities, as it allows users to browse
    the web almost completely anonymously. Tor achieves this by directing internet
    traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer network consisting of more than 6,000
    relays to conceal a user’s location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance
    or traffic analysis. This is the basis of the Silk Road, and was the reason why
    Ulbricht believed his anonymity was bulletproof.

  zh: Tor——洋葱路由器——是20世纪90年代美国海军开发的软件基础设施，旨在保护美国情报通信在线。自2002年发布以来，并通过后续的增强，Tor已成为首选的网络用于毒品、欺诈和其他非法活动，因为它允许用户几乎完全匿名地浏览网页。Tor通过将互联网流量通过一个由超过6000个中继组成的全球自愿网络来隐藏用户的位置和使用情况，以避免任何进行网络监视或流量分析的人员发现。这是丝绸之路的基础，也是为什么乌尔布里希特认为他的匿名性是万无一失的原因。
- en: Equally, Tor may be near anonymous, but bitcoins are not. All bitcoin transactions
    are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin
    addresses are the only information used to define where bitcoins are allocated
    and where they are sent. These addresses are created privately by each user’s
    wallet. However, once addresses are used, they are then linked with the history
    of all of the transactions they are involved with. Anyone can see the balance
    and all of the transactions of any address—as users usually have to reveal their
    identity in order to receive goods and services, bitcoin addresses cannot remain
    fully anonymous. For these reasons, bitcoin addresses should only be used once
    and users must be careful not to disclose their addresses by, for example, using
    multiple wallets for different purposes. Doing so allows the user to isolate each
    of their transactions in such a way that it is not possible to link them. People
    who send you money cannot see what other bitcoin addresses you own and what you
    do with them.

  zh: 同样地，Tor可能接近匿名，但比特币并不是。所有比特币交易都是公开的、可追踪的，并永久存储在比特币网络中。比特币地址是唯一用来定义比特币分配和发送位置的信息。这些地址是由每个用户的钱包私下创建的。然而，一旦地址被使用，它们便与其参与的所有交易的历史相关联。任何人都可以看到任何地址的余额和所有交易，因为用户通常必须透露他们的身份以便接收商品和服务，比特币地址不能完全匿名。因此，比特币地址应该只使用一次，用户必须小心不要通过例如为不同目的使用多个钱包来泄露他们的地址。这样做可以使用户以一种不可能链接的方式隔离他们的每笔交易。给你钱的人看不到你拥有的其他比特币地址以及你对它们的处理。
- en: Nevertheless, what should concern the authorities is that if someone copied
    the example of Silk Road and employed professional programmers, then the dark
    net libertarian dream of money without government, and exchange without controls,
    could be realised.
