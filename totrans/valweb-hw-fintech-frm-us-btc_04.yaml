    My contention is that the ValueWeb is the key development. As mentioned, the ValueWeb
    is based upon two technologies: mobile, to allow everyone to exchange value in
    real time; and digital currencies, to provide a store of value to exchange. As
    these technologies have risen, so has the focus upon digitalisation in banking
    and now FinTech.'

- en: FinTech is the new market that integrates finance and technology. This new market
    is a hybrid of the traditional processes of finance—working capital, supply chain,
    payments processing, deposit accounts, life assurance and so on—but replaces their
    traditional structures with a new technology-based process.

    like talking about retailers, and saying that Amazon is a retailer. Are they a
    retailer or an e-commerce company or both? I would claim that they are a digital
    service provider of fulfilment, but that’s purely because they fulfil consumer
    orders as well as cloud-based service delivery through AWS. In other words, they’re
    not a retailer at all, but a company in a whole new marketplace.

    market of digital finance that will, over time, displace the traditional financial

    Internet of Value replaces the old world of physical banks dealing in physical
    currencies. Just as I argue in my previous book, *Digital Bank,* banks have historically
    dealt with the physical distribution of paper through a localised network of the
    branch, whilst the ValueWeb deals with the digital distribution of data through
    the globalised network of the internet. The digital network replaces the physical

- en: “*Silicon Valley is coming.* There are hundreds of start-ups with a lot of brains
    and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking. The ones you
    read about most are in the lending business, whereby the firms can lend to individuals
    and small businesses very quickly and—these entities believe—effectively by using
    Big Data to enhance credit underwriting. They are very good at reducing the ‘pain
    points’ in that they can make loans in minutes, which might take banks weeks.

- en: “*Competitors are coming in the payments area.* You all have read about Bitcoin,
    merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal lookalikes. Payments
    are a critical business for us—and we are quite good at it. But there is much
    for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques, and
    reduction of costs and ‘pain points’ for customers. Some payments systems, particularly
    the ACH system controlled by NACHA, cannot function in real time and, worse, are
    continuously misused by free riders on the system. There is a true cost to allowing
    people to move money. For example, it costs retailers 50–70 basis points to use
    cash (due to preventing fraud and providing security, etc.). And retailers often
    will pay one percent to an intermediary to guarantee that a check is good. A guaranteed
    check essentially is the same as a debit card transaction, for which they want
    to pay 0 percent. For some competitors, free riding is the only thing that makes
    their competition possible. Having said that, we need to acknowledge our own flaws.
    We need to build a real-time system that properly charges participants for usage,
    allows for good customer service, and minimizes fraud and bad behavior.”

    with old processes in old banks. Banks take weeks to process lending decisions,
    whilst P2P lenders take seconds. Why does it take banks weeks? Jamie Dimon doesn’t
    say, but I suspect the answer is because banks are laden with sedentary processes
    built in the last century for the physical distribution of paper in a localised
    network. The branch network was filled with human automatons who could manage
    transactions but not assess risk. Risk is a head office function managed by specialists,
    who are trusted not to lend to people who are not creditworthy (hence the reason
    why we avoided a credit crisis!). The process needed to work out whether the applicant
    was suitable or not would take weeks. Now, self-service forms online have replaced
    the automatons, and automated systems have replaced the specialists. That’s why
    the new P2P providers can replace banks with instantaneous decision-making services
    at a fraction of the cost. After all, a server for $1,000 is far cheaper than
    a specialist head office credit risk manager costing tens of thousands.

    stores and value exchanges. This controls monetary supply and economic stability.

    agents and music shops didn’t have.

    not necessarily in monetary form, but in a social form. *Gifting, shares*, *likes*,
    *favourites* are all forms of caring and supporting in these communities and can
    lead to real value exchanges that do translate into monetary value. For example,
    in the largest social network you’ve probably never heard of, called YY in China,
    top karaoke singers regularly make $20,000 per month from virtual gifts, with
    one college student reportedly earning an astonishing $188,000 per month by using

    In fact, through the social network, there are many alternative ways of building
    value other than, or even instead of, trading pure products or traditional services.
    We see this with crowdfunding and crowdsourcing through sites like Kickstarter
    and Indiegogo, but it goes further. For example, any individual can be a media
    station. A great example is PewDiePie, who makes about $7 million a year through
    YouTube videos of his reactions to popular game releases thanks to his near 40

    they’ve got it a thousand percent wrong. After all, digibank starts with digital
    community relationships and ends with branch-based relationships. Most existing
    banks start with the branch and end with digital. Digibank is designed for the
    digital distribution of data in a global network; most banks are built for the
    physical distribution of paper in a local network. And digibank is focused upon
    leveraging every point of the network to maximise the relationship 24–7.

  zh: 现在，提供这种能力的唯一途径是通过在互联网时代设计的数字基础设施上构建一切。因此，当一家银行表示将数字作为一个渠道添加到其现有基础设施时，他们完全错了一千倍。毕竟，数字银行始于数字社区关系，终于基于分支的关系。大多数现有银行从分支开始，以数字结束。数字银行旨在全球网络中数字化数据的分发；大多数银行是为本地网络中纸质的分发而建立的。数字银行专注于利用网络的每一点来最大程度地促进关系
    24-7。
- en: Most banks are focused upon just having a relationship. That’s why the ones
    that are true digital banks, rather than just banks with digital channels, will
    win.

  zh: 大多数银行只关注于建立关系。这就是为什么真正的数字银行，而不仅仅是具有数字渠道的银行，会获胜的原因。
