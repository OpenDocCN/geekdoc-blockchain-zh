    My contention is that the ValueWeb is the key development. As mentioned, the ValueWeb
    is based upon two technologies: mobile, to allow everyone to exchange value in

    service provider of fulfilment, but that’s purely because they fulfil consumer

    market of digital finance that will, over time, displace the traditional financial
    markets. This is because the ValueWeb is building the Internet of Value, and the
    Internet of Value replaces the old world of physical banks dealing in physical
    currencies. Just as I argue in my previous book, *Digital Bank,* banks have historically
    dealt with the physical distribution of paper through a localised network of the
    branch, whilst the ValueWeb deals with the digital distribution of data through
    the globalised network of the internet. The digital network replaces the physical
    network, and the FinTech community is building the new system. Eventually, the

    Big Data to enhance credit underwriting. They are very good at reducing the ‘pain
    points’ in that they can make loans in minutes, which might take banks weeks.

    for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques, and
    reduction of costs and ‘pain points’ for customers. Some payments systems, particularly
    the ACH system controlled by NACHA, cannot function in real time and, worse, are
    continuously misused by free riders on the system. There is a true cost to allowing
    people to move money. For example, it costs retailers 50–70 basis points to use
    cash (due to preventing fraud and providing security, etc.). And retailers often
    will pay one percent to an intermediary to guarantee that a check is good. A guaranteed
    check essentially is the same as a debit card transaction, for which they want
    to pay 0 percent. For some competitors, free riding is the only thing that makes
    their competition possible. Having said that, we need to acknowledge our own flaws.
    We need to build a real-time system that properly charges participants for usage,
    allows for good customer service, and minimizes fraud and bad behavior.”

    firms dealing with the ValueWeb. J.P. Morgan Chase is suffering the pain of seeing
    their credit markets attacked by P2P lenders and their payment markets attacked
    by cheap, real-time alternatives. The ValueWeb, remember, is driven by mobile
    for real-time, peer-to-peer connectivity and digital currencies to exchange value
    cheaply. These are the two technologies driving the attack on traditional, incumbent
    banks like J.P. Morgan Chase.

    with old processes in old banks. Banks take weeks to process lending decisions,
    whilst P2P lenders take seconds. Why does it take banks weeks? Jamie Dimon doesn’t
    say, but I suspect the answer is because banks are laden with sedentary processes
    built in the last century for the physical distribution of paper in a localised
    network. The branch network was filled with human automatons who could manage
    transactions but not assess risk. Risk is a head office function managed by specialists,
    who are trusted not to lend to people who are not creditworthy (hence the reason
    why we avoided a credit crisis!). The process needed to work out whether the applicant
    was suitable or not would take weeks. Now, self-service forms online have replaced
    the automatons, and automated systems have replaced the specialists. That’s why
    the new P2P providers can replace banks with instantaneous decision-making services
    at a fraction of the cost. After all, a server for $1,000 is far cheaper than
    a specialist head office credit risk manager costing tens of thousands.

    done through devices with no physical need for service. You cannot have that with
    airlines (you need to physically travel) or gas stations (you need to physically

    all those other lines of business, banking is regulated. Banking is integrated
    with government policy; it is a political instrument; it is used as the government’s
    control mechanism for social order; and it is key to a country’s economic success
    or failure. For this reason, it is in a government’s interest to licence value
    stores and value exchanges. This controls monetary supply and economic stability.

    white paper of Satoshi Nakamoto is so important. It’s not bitcoin, or even the

    ledger system through the internet that can record any exchange of value between
    anyone in real-time for virtually free. That is the key reason why this is being
    debated so actively by banks. So as we rapidly turn our archaic batch, back-end

    in days with high fees, to value exchange in real-time to almost free. That solves

    most importantly, pay through the app. The way you pay is using a QR code on the

    automatically with bills provided electronically.

    code if you are a customer of this bank. As a result, their competitors are now
    asking to be part of the app and the bank is charging a fee to the other banks
    to include them in the wallet.

    You’ve probably heard the crowdfunders idea of gathering enough people who want
    a particular product to get a discount on that product. If you can find a hundred
    mates who all want to buy the new BMW 5-series, then BMW will give you a discount
    if you order a hundred BMW 5-series this week. Well, there’s another bank that
    is taking this idea to leverage value for their customers.
  prefs: []

    they find a large group of customers who have all *liked* the announcement of
    the new BMW 5-series, for example, then they would approach BMW to negotiate a
    deal. The bank might then commit to buy a hundred cars in the first week of release
    and, by doing so, would contact all the customers who *like* the new BMW 5-series
    and let them know that if they want one, not only would they get a whopping discount,
    but a competitive loan from the bank, too.

    giving them value. The bank cross-sells a loan to the customer at a discount rate
    and, most importantly, gains a hundred loans in a week for a three- to five-year
    period. The customers are locked in and the bank is happy. The customer is happy
    too, as they have a new BMW 5-series ordered at a 20 percent discount *and* a

    of things to sense when to make you that credit or loan offer, but extends further
    and deeper than this. A contextual relationship will be customer intimate by using

    these online social communities there is a lot of value shared. This value is
    not necessarily in monetary form, but in a social form. *Gifting, shares*, *likes*,
    *favourites* are all forms of caring and supporting in these communities and can
    lead to real value exchanges that do translate into monetary value. For example,
    in the largest social network you’ve probably never heard of, called YY in China,
    top karaoke singers regularly make $20,000 per month from virtual gifts, with
    one college student reportedly earning an astonishing $188,000 per month by using
    the site to give Photoshop lessons.

    In fact, through the social network, there are many alternative ways of building
    value other than, or even instead of, trading pure products or traditional services.
    We see this with crowdfunding and crowdsourcing through sites like Kickstarter
    and Indiegogo, but it goes further. For example, any individual can be a media
    station. A great example is PewDiePie, who makes about $7 million a year through
    YouTube videos of his reactions to popular game releases thanks to his near 40
    million subscribers. That subscriber base is bigger than most TV channels.
