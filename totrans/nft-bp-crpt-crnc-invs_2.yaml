    using encryption science (cryptology). There may be different blockchain applications,
    but their common feature is that the data cannot be deleted or modified retroactively.
    A copy of the data is stored in decentralized distributed structures, and data
    ownership and control within this distributed structure is also secured with a
    password key. With this system in our hands, we can now start shaping the data
    on it as we wish. The entire blockchain realm, is actually made up of platforms,

    is not compatible with the old blocks. Old clients do not understand this change
    in the log and, if in doubt, discard the individual transactions or entire blocks.
    The prime example of a hard fork is a change in block size. A block larger than
    one megabyte on Bitcoin's blockchain is considered faulty by the current clients
    and is therefore discarded. Proponents of the new block size cannot simply send
    the large blocks to all clients but must ensure that they are accepted. This is
    only possible if enough participants can be found to use the appropriately adapted
    mining software.

  zh: 与软分叉不同，硬分叉是一种对区块链进行更改的方式，这种更改与旧区块不兼容。旧客户端无法理解日志中的这种更改，如果有疑问，会丢弃单个交易或整个区块。硬分叉的典型例子是更改区块大小。比特币区块链上超过一兆字节的区块被当前客户端视为有缺陷，因此被丢弃。新区块大小的支持者不能简单地将大区块发送给所有客户端，而必须确保它们被接受。只有在足够的参与者可以使用相应调整过的挖矿软件时才可能实现这一点。
- en: 'Changing the size of the protocol is technically relatively easy to perform.
    Rather, the problem lies in convincing a large part of the community of the new
    block size so that it is accepted in its implementation. In the case of the Hard
    Fork, the new system is introduced after a specific block, which has been defined
    in advance. This creates two different blockchains: the first blockchain continues
    the old system and refuses to accept the changed blocks. The second blockchain,
    on the other hand, only accepts the new blocks and no longer allows the old ones.
    The two blockchains share a common past but go their separate ways after the split.'

    it is in the mind of the miners that many users are behind the new system. With

    means it is possible to send or own a fraction of Bitcoin or another ERC-20 token.
    Similar to cash, where you can pay with a ten-dollar note and receive change.
    Non-fungible tokens cannot be shared and must be purchased or sold in their entirety.

- en: When an asset is fungible, it means that it can be easily interchanged with
    another asset, as is the case with barter trade, or it can be exchanged for money.
    That means you can use a fungible asset to acquire goods or services. More so,
    fungible assets can be broken down into smaller units. For example, bitcoin is
    a fungible asset. Take BTC for example. 1 BTC can be subdivided into eight decimal
    places to the smallest unit called the Satoshi.

    BTC 为例。1 BTC 可以被细分为八个小数点，最小的单位称为 Satoshi。

    instead of another NFT. This is because each NFT is unique and has its own features
    and information. An example of this would be the game CryptoKitties. A user cannot
    use an asset from the game in another game. This is due to the uniqueness of every

    the next sale can also be encoded inside the NFT. Thus, in the event of a sale,
    the relevant amount is automatically transferred to the artist's wallet. The digital
    nature allows users of all types to buy them from all over the world. As the customer
    base expands thanks to digitalization, the number of people who can reach the
    work and want to invest increases and the demand increases, and the price increases
    as the demand increases. As demand increases, so do supply. Both more works and
    works at different price levels are coming to market. This increases accessibility

  zh: Ian Grigg：Ricardian Contracts 背后的人
- en: Ricardian Contracts were first developed in 1995 as part of the Ricardo Payment
    System. Ian Grigg, the man behind this new legal document, is considered one of
    the pioneers of financial encryption. Interestingly, he was still a student when
    he developed the Ricardian Conventions. That's why people called it the Ian Grigg
    Ricardian Contract.

    After all, he developed an interesting concept for quantifying a legal contract
    or any financial instrument or entity. However, in the 90s, there was no suitable
    technology for applying ideas according to their values. But this limitation no

    power is required to access them. No one has that much computer power, so we need
