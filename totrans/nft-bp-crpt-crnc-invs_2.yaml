    using encryption science (cryptology). There may be different blockchain applications,
    but their common feature is that the data cannot be deleted or modified retroactively.
    A copy of the data is stored in decentralized distributed structures, and data
    ownership and control within this distributed structure is also secured with a
    password key. With this system in our hands, we can now start shaping the data
    on it as we wish. The entire blockchain realm, is actually made up of platforms,

    is not compatible with the old blocks. Old clients do not understand this change
    in the log and, if in doubt, discard the individual transactions or entire blocks.
    The prime example of a hard fork is a change in block size. A block larger than
    one megabyte on Bitcoin's blockchain is considered faulty by the current clients
    and is therefore discarded. Proponents of the new block size cannot simply send
    the large blocks to all clients but must ensure that they are accepted. This is
    only possible if enough participants can be found to use the appropriately adapted
    mining software.

  zh: 与软分叉不同，硬分叉是一种对区块链进行更改的方式，这种更改与旧区块不兼容。旧客户端无法理解日志中的这种更改，如果有疑问，会丢弃单个交易或整个区块。硬分叉的典型例子是更改区块大小。比特币区块链上超过一兆字节的区块被当前客户端视为有缺陷，因此被丢弃。新区块大小的支持者不能简单地将大区块发送给所有客户端，而必须确保它们被接受。只有在足够的参与者可以使用相应调整过的挖矿软件时才可能实现这一点。
- en: 'Changing the size of the protocol is technically relatively easy to perform.
    Rather, the problem lies in convincing a large part of the community of the new
    block size so that it is accepted in its implementation. In the case of the Hard
    Fork, the new system is introduced after a specific block, which has been defined
    in advance. This creates two different blockchains: the first blockchain continues
    the old system and refuses to accept the changed blocks. The second blockchain,
    on the other hand, only accepts the new blocks and no longer allows the old ones.
    The two blockchains share a common past but go their separate ways after the split.'

    it is in the mind of the miners that many users are behind the new system. With

- en: Non-Fungible Token means token that cannot be divided and cannot be produced
    again from the same. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, which
    are fungible, NFT's are unique digital assets. To illustrate with an example,
    today you can buy and buy a Bitcoin or Ether by breaking it into pieces and exchange
    the same cryptocurrency in its own unit. However, it cannot be exchanged for another
    token as it is unique to NFT, a private digital asset. Its internal value is determined
    by its manufacturer or investor.

- en: NFT's are manufactured according to the ERC-721 token standard prepared by Ethereum
    developers. There are platforms that make it possible to perform the transaction
    easily so that users do not choke on the technical world of blockchain. All you
    need to produce NFT is a digital cryptocurrency wallet. After you upload the file
    that you want to produce as an NFT to the IPFS system through these platforms,
    you must specify the parameters of the NFT that cannot be changed. After determining
    the features such as how many will be produced from NFT, price, how much share
    you will need to be paid on the next sale, NFT's will be produced by paying the
    transaction fee of the blockchain network. Upon completion of the transaction,
    NFT's are transferred to your wallet and recorded on the entire blockchain where
    the production is carried out.

    by the person or investor who produces the work rather than the checkboard. If
    we interpret the subject of investment through digital art, it is not so different
    from investing in physical art. Similarly, parameters such as how rare that asset
    is, its age, and cosmetics determine the value of an asset you purchase as part
    of the collection.

- en: If we take into account the current uses of NFT's, we can say that it solves
    intellectual property problems first. While it is very easy to copy a work in
    digital environment, NFT solves this problem by revealing who owns the rights
    to the work. Because they are a programmable digital asset, artists' share of
    the next sale can also be encoded inside the NFT. Thus, in the event of a sale,
    the relevant amount is automatically transferred to the artist's wallet. The digital
    nature allows users of all types to buy them from all over the world. As the customer
    base expands thanks to digitalization, the number of people who can reach the
    work and want to invest increases and the demand increases, and the price increases
    as the demand increases. As demand increases, so do supply. Both more works and
    works at different price levels are coming to market. This increases accessibility
    for investors and art lovers and allows more works to be sold. The ecosystem is
    expanding.

    Artists who produce NFT and want to put it up for sale go through the stream of
    verified profiles used by NFT marketplace applications to prove that their work
    is original. If you have the information of the wallet address of the artist concerned,
    which is shared publicly for the purpose of receiving payment, you have the chance
    to confirm the authenticity of the work. In addition, you can be sure of the authenticity
    of both the artist and his works by tracking the movements of the NFT from the
    blockchain monitoring application.

    IPFS. Uploaded files are encrypted and broken into small pieces and shared to
    drops on IPFS. Proof that the relevant file has been uploaded to IPFS is saved
    on the blockchain with NFT.

    home in America sold for $500,000\. We also know that in some games land sales
    are made as NFT. Another area where NFT will have an impact will be social media.
    Metrics such as the number of follow-ups, views and views that creator’s cash
    in on will become unaffordable by centralized social media companies thanks to
    NFT's. Digitization of physical assets seems to cause us to redesign many of the
    processes we are accustomed to. We can consider a scenario in which NFT generates
    government bonds as NFT in future uses and can trade them globally. Obviously,
    business models in the NFT world are limited to your imagination.

    There are a large number of documents, communication with different companies

- en: Moreover, an escrow service, which is especially useful in such transactions,
    provides an assurance since the amounts in question are normally quite large and
    you cannot really trust the counterparties. However, after a successful deal,
    the seller and the buyer's agents will share about ten percent of the sale price
    as commissions. This means a fairly significant financial loss for the seller

    stored in the system and distributed to the participating parties at the same
    time. In addition, error-free delivery is guaranteed because the transaction has
    been witnessed and verified by hundreds of people. Since trust between the parties
    is no longer an issue, an intermediary is no longer needed. All functions made
    by a real estate agent can be preprogrammed into a smart contract, saving both
    the seller and the buyer a significant amount of money at the same time.

    provided a suitable environment for smart contracts. Interestingly, Nick Szabo
    designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency called Bit Gold in 1998\.

    that already exist and are the most important and one of the most suggested features
