    using encryption science (cryptology). There may be different blockchain applications,
    but their common feature is that the data cannot be deleted or modified retroactively.
    A copy of the data is stored in decentralized distributed structures, and data
    ownership and control within this distributed structure is also secured with a
    password key. With this system in our hands, we can now start shaping the data
    on it as we wish. The entire blockchain realm, is actually made up of platforms,
    products, services and services built on this basic logic.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    You will play a game during a party with 5 friends. You start the game by signing
    a signature by typing your name on a label. Then you put this tag on your rope
    and tie a knot. A close friend then signs off by typing his name on another label
    and ties the knot by putting it on the same rope. All 5 of your friends are repeating
    this process. You now have a rope that moves in a specific order, each knotted
    with labels with a person's name and signature on top.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The blockchain registration system is basically similar to this example. The
    names we write our labels refer to the data. Each label in which data is written
    with certain rules refers to structures called Blocks. Each block has its own
    special signature. Signatures in blockchain applications are produced with a special
    mathematical application that we discuss with details in the second part of our
    book. The equivalent of our rope in the Blockchain system is the timeline, as
    soon as each block is created, information containing date and time information
    is added to the block (the node we put on our rope). Thus, the data blocks that
    are recorded at a certain time, each with its own signature, are sorted in turn
    and form a blockchain. Because this is the first record start-up block in this
    structure, this block is specifically called Genesis.

    will need to tear that label or untie all nodes up to that label, remove that
    label, and then knot the other labels in order again. We can even move the label
    we've removed. The process can be a bit laborious, but it is possible to achieve
    it. Once we have noticed this danger, to eliminate it, let's re-create the "reconciliation
    structure" and replay our game by adding a new rule to our label chain.
  prefs: []

    and tie the knot again. This time, under the label that another friend wrote and
    signed his own name, we'll sign our own as the owner of the first label and tie
    the knot in this way. In the third place, our friend who wrote his name and signed
    his name on the second label should sign his name. When the process continues
    in this way, each new label, except for the first label, will have the signature
    of the owner of the previous label added, except for our friend who wrote and
    signed his name on that label.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    remove a label or move it, each label will also have the signature of the previous
    label when it was created, so it can be easily understood that the order is broken
    when our label chain is carefully checked.
  prefs: []

- en: A similar approach is used in the blockchain structure. Since the first created
    block is not a block before it, Genesis, that is, the start-up, is called the
    block and carries only its own digital signature, but each subsequent block will
    carry its own, as well as the unique signature of the previous one. Thus, a sequential
    recording structure becomes possible in the digital world.

    blank label in their hand and ask us to sign it. Then he'll put it on his own
    ropes and tie the knot. After our second friend writes and signs his name on his
    own label, he'll get us to sign it and tie the knot by putting it on the ropes.
    Everyone else will put the name of our second friend on an empty label and sign
    it to us because we created the first label with this friend, and then tie the
    knot. In this way, 5 people will form one label chain with the same order at a

    There are a large number of documents, communication with different companies
    and people, as well as a high level of various risks. Therefore, the absolute
    majority of home sellers want to find a real estate agent who deals with all the
    paperwork, markets the property and acts as an intermediary when negotiations
    begin, overseeing the deal until it closes.

    provides an assurance since the amounts in question are normally quite large and
    you cannot really trust the counterparties. However, after a successful deal,
    the seller and the buyer's agents will share about ten percent of the sale price
    as commissions. This means a fairly significant financial loss for the seller
    or buyer.

    is no longer an issue, an intermediary is no longer needed. All functions made

    implemented in the world of finance and banking. Nevertheless, this technology
    can be used by governments around the world to make the voting system more accessible
    and transparent. Supply chains can be used both to track goods and to automate
    all related tasks and payments. Real estate, healthcare, taxes, insurance and
    countless other industries can benefit from the implementation of smart contracts
    and the benefits they must offer.

    shaves off potential wheezes in communication and workflow thanks to accuracy,
    transparency and automated system. In general, business operations should be impatient
    to resolve themselves while awaiting approval and with internal and external issues.
    A blockchain book will sort it out. It also eliminates inconsistencies that often
    arise during independent processing, which can lead to costly litigation and settlement
    delays.

    "Most often, supply chains are blocked by paper-based systems; Here the forms
    have to go through numerous channels for approval, which increases the exposure
    to loss and fraud. Blockchain overrides this by providing a secure, accessible
    digital version to all parties in the chain and automates tasks and payments."
    Barclays Corporate Bank uses smart contracts to record property changes and automatically
    transfers payments to other financial institutions upon arrival.

    robots. Imagine a future where everything is almost automated. Google comes with
    smartphones, stylish glasses and even smart cars. This is where smart contracts
    work. An example of this is that smart contracts can place in a kind of "prophecy"
    game that can determine who is defective in an accident. Self-driving or self-parked
    and vehicles with sensors or drivers, as well as countless other variables, can
    be a good example. Using smart contracts, an auto insurance company can charge
    customers different fees based on where and under what conditions they run their
    vehicles.

    a house to someone, you need to pay an intermediary vendor, such as a sahibinden.com
    or a newspaper, to advertise it. Not only that, but maybe you should pay the realtor.
    A digital notebook reduces your costs. All you have to do is pay in bitcoin and
    encode your contract in the book. Everyone sees it and you manage to perform it
    automatically. Brokers, real estate agents, hard-pressed lenders and anyone associated
    with real estate can make a profit.

    a private key that will provide access to specific individuals. The same strategy
    can be used to ensure that research is conducted (safely and confidentially) under
    HIPAA law. Surgery invoices can be stored in a blockchain and automatically sent
    to insurance providers as a delivery document. The ledger can also be used for
    general health management, such as drug inspection, compliance, testing results
    and health supplies administration.

    will governments regulate those contracts? Or how will governments accrue taxes
    on these smart contract transactions? At this point, let's consider the example
    of rent we gave above.

    public without my consent before the rental date arrives? If this was a traditional
    contract, I could have cancelled it in court, but blockchain is a different matter.
    The contract, no matter what, is carried out.

    suggest that smart contracts can affect changes in certain industries, such as
    the law. In this case, lawyers will move to producing standard smart contract
    templates by writing traditional contracts, similar to the standardized traditional
    contracts you will find in LegalZoom. Other sectors, such as commercial buyers,
    credit companies, and accountants, can implement smart contracts for tasks such
    as real-time audits and risk assessments. Others foresee smart contracts being
    converted into a hybrid of paper and digital content, if contracts are verified
    via blockchain and verified by physical copy.
