    between the different types of blockchains, it appears logical to discuss just
    how information is approved, verified, and added to existing blocks to form the
    blockchain itself (Andolfatto [2018](#CR1)). There are numerous iterations available
    in the marketplace, and this is not meant to be an all-inclusive listing nor an
    exhaustive one. Rather, by understanding what these different approval methodologies
    are, and having a working baseline for what these options mean, will equip financial

    walk through a quick and simple example. In a traditional financial transaction,
    such as an accounting entry, recording a trade, or verifying a counterparty has
    signed a document, the initial entry authority usually lies with one person at
    one of the organizations. Usually this individual, or even automated program,
    performs the role correctly and catches any errors before they are entered into
    the system and have the ability to cause financial damage. The key word there
    is usually, and there are numerous examples of how relying on an individual –
    or even one organization – to be the sole authority of data entry and validation
    has failed.

    occurred during the financial crisis, as well as those that occur at an infrequent
    but unsettlingly common rate, are a prime example. Shifting gears to the market
    trading and liquidity conversation, the London Whale fiasco at J.P. Morgan highlighted
    just how weak internal controls over trading, trade limits, and supervision of
    these activities can be even at the largest and most sophisticated of organizations.
    Numerous other failures, be they associated with mortgages being sold with proper
    documentation or support, reports being issued and then retracted, or a lack of
    reliable data hampering decision making figure just how vulnerable a centralized
    approval and documentation process can actually be. Now, with that said, it is
    also important to realize that – for the vast majority of instances – a centralized
    data management solution may work perfectly fine. As information and business
    becomes increasingly digital, global, and decentralized in nature, however, the
    odds of that maintaining a centralized platform for core operations will not sufficient

    blockchain is mentioned in a conversation, in the form a widely distributed database
    that any individual or organization can join and become a member of. Completely
    decentralized in nature, and providing large degrees of anonymity, a public blockchain
    can be as large as network members wish it to be. In addition to allowing anyone
    to join and become a member of this network, the concept of the public blockchain
    is also the type of blockchain that underpins Bitcoin. Even from a high level,
    this open access generates quite a issues and open items as they connect to ligation,
    governance, and conflict resolution mechanisms that are all of importance for
    financial professionals to understand (Webster and Charfoos [2018](#CR8)). This
    book is not about cryptocurrencies specifically, but in the following pages we
    are going to discuss and analyze just what Bitcoin is, cut through the hype, and
    connect Bitcoin to financial services. For the time being, however, the idea of
    a public blockchain can be thought of as the “ideal” version and type of blockchain
    technology as per some of the most outspoken advocates of the platform.

    by the very nature of the technology itself, there is no need for a central clearing
    house or an overseeing institution to verify, clear, or confirm transactions.
    This may very well appeal to some libertarian oriented proponents of blockchain,
    or individuals who are dissatisfied with the status of the current banking and
    regulatory system, but does present several critical issues for financial professionals.
    For example, and something that has seized the attention of financial professionals
    across industry subsectors, is the reality that if this completely decentralized
    financial system matures from concept to reality there will be less need and fewer
    requirements for intermediaries. Think about this specific example; if individuals
    or organizations can transact business and send information to each other without
    the need for an intermediary to verify or confirm this data, are banks and other
    financial institutions truly necessary?

- en: Some of the disadvantages and downsides to a truly public blockchain implementation
    and methodology is that, as the public blockchain expands and grows and size,
    the actual verification and confirmation of individual transactions can become
    increasingly cumbersome. One of the most popular and widely utilized public blockchains
    is the blockchain network that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, with well
    over ten million members as of 2018\. The size of the network itself, however,
    is not necessarily a problem or complicating issue; it is the combination of network
    size and data verification method that can complicate the utilization process.
    Drilling down a little bit more, and linking back to the proof of work idea introduced
    previously, this approval and consensus based verification methodology associated
    with Bitcoin and other public networks is commonly the proof of work protocol.
    While perhaps the most authentic, to some, form of how data should be approved
    when added to a blockchain environment, this can form a bottleneck in terms of
    many transactions and interactions can actually be verified by network members.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, at the midpoint of 2018, the number of transactions that can be
    verified and added to the Bitcoin blockchain, the largest and most well established
    blockchain network, can handle anywhere between 10–15 transactions per second.
    This is not by any means a slow or cumbersome pace of data approval, but when
    compared to the amount of data that can be processed or approved by existing credit
    card and other financial intermediaries, the significant short comings of Bitcoin
    as a tool for purchasing becomes apparent. In addition to not being as efficient
    or as fast as existing approval methodologies, the proof of work methodology utilized
    by the Bitcoin blockchain has two other issues worthy of note. First, the sheer
    amount of computing power and servers required to process and confirm different
    transactions and information means that, as the blockchain becomes larger, ever
    larger and more complex computing power is necessary to become a proactive part
    of the network. Second, and on top of the array of computing power and infrastructure
    required, all of this computing equipment draws a tremendous amount of electricity.
    The need for electricity has grown so large there have been cases of utility operates
    seeking to sublet or lease portions of locations to facilitate the blockchain

    purists as a true blockchain model, due to the somewhat hybrid nature of a how
    private blockchain network is constructed and operated. Now, with that said, it
    is important to remember that even though a private blockchain is a hybrid model
    and type of blockchain, the underlying fundamentals of how data is added and approved
    is not substantially different. The core differentiating factor between a private
    and public blockchain is while there is no central hub or authority in the context
    of a public blockchain, a private blockchain will have an organizing firm. An
    organizing firm can be any type of organization, be it a bank, other financial
    institution or some other type of organization such as the Walmart example introduced
    previously.
  prefs: []

- en: The organizing firm is the firm or organization that, for lack of a better descriptive
    turn of phrase, writes and develops all of the rules and guidelines for how the
    blockchain will operate. Specifically, the organizing firm will, through the coding
    and programming language embedded in how the blockchain functions, decide and
    authorize what type of organization can be a part of the network, and also what
    these different members are authorized to do. Taking a closer look at what exactly
    might mean, an analogy to help connect this somewhat abstract idea to a concept
    more familiar to everyone in financial services. One way to think of a private
    blockchain is to think of it akin to a shareable document, like a Google Doc.
    The individual who creates the document folder or document can decide (1) who
    is authorized to have access to the file or folder in question, and (2) what those
    different individuals are authorized to actually do once they are a part of the
    network, just like different users can have either edit, comment, or view only
    ability.

    a pure public blockchain this means that approval, data verification, and communicating
    this information out to other network members can be done in a much more streamlined
    manner. Taking an objective view, these benefits make sense; unlike a public blockchain
    which anyone can join and therefore become part of, the approval process a private
    blockchain can be restricted to only include individuals who are directly involved.
    This combination of restricted membership and different assigned level of responsibility
    also means, that in addition to being more efficient and practical for business
    use, a private blockchain may actually be a more environmentally conscious option.
    Since, as a result of the oversight of the organizing firm, any approval and verification
    process may be used by network members, this also means that the confirmation
    and approval of information can happen in a more time efficient manner than if
    a purely public blockchain model is utilized.

- en: Some of the disadvantages of a private blockchain stem from the very technology
    itself, and how it is adapted from a purely public model to a private blockchain
    setup, which can for all intents and purposes, be thought of as a hybrid. Specifically,
    and of particular importance for financial services professionals seeking to implement
    and leverage blockchain technology is an organizing firm can construct policies,
    guidelines, and requirements in a wide variety of ways. For example, in a private
    blockchain network if the organizing firm and protocols are written in such a
    way that a block of organizations, certain select firms, or a small handful of
    organizations can upload, verify, and validate blocks of data without oversight
    from other network members this poses a threat to the applicability of this technology
    to financial services. In addition to this fundamental flaw in the private blockchain
    model there is the also the requirement that, for the organizing firm to actually
    lead the private blockchain itself that organization must have the sufficient
    technical expertise to do so. In addition to placing the onus on the organizing
    firm, this also creates an opportunity wherein, if clients and other organizations
    join a private network led by an unethical actor, all other network members are
    potentially at risk.

    technology for an individual organization, especially given the distributed and
    open access nature of the information that is stored on the platform itself. Particularly
    given the price volatility (namely price declines) that have been associated with
    the cryptocurrency marketplace in 2018 and 2019, some investors and institutions
    have been increasingly hesitant to invest in public or completely distributed
    blockchain models. Even though the underlying blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies
    themselves are not exactly the same thing, they do operate in the same crypto-blockchain
    ecosystem, and are influenced by each other as a matter of course. Contrasting
    with this, an entirely private blockchain model, despite the benefits and efficiency
    generating characteristics of such as model, does not always appear to be appropriate
    for every instance as well. In order to construct and operationalize a private
    blockchain model, in essence, there has to be one firm or organization in charge
    of the operating protocols and algorithms that drive the network itself.

- en: In some cases, such as much publicized private blockchain constructed as a joint
    venture between IBM and Walmart, the organization in charge may have the technical
    and financial capabilities to both build and maintain a private blockchain. More
    importantly, the organizing firm might have the leverage and bargaining position
    to help enforce and require different members of the supply chain or network to
    adopt the private blockchain model developed at the organizing firm. That said,
    it is important to recognize the reality that especially in areas or industries
    with a relatively high concentration of market power – such as in accounting or
    investment banking – there may be several institutions that would want to assume
    the role of organizing firm. Even with the appropriate safeguards and controls
    in place, there is always risk associated with basically outsourcing the storage
    and safeguarding of information to a third party firm, especially if there is
    a semi-cooperation and semi-competition model. This desire, and reflection of
    market realities has led some industries and organizations operating therein to
    try and develop a model and idea that meets the needs of the marketplace while
    still allowing the individual firms to maintain control and ownership over information
    and data.
  prefs: []

- en: Distilled down to the core idea, a consortium blockchain model is best summarized
    as a group effort toward developing and maintaining a blockchain. Sector specific
    blockchain platforms are already being developed in real estate, healthcare, accounting,
    finance, and the area of royalty payment and distribution, including blockchain
    as a service offerings beginning to enter the marketplace (Roberts [2019](#CR7)).
    Benefits associated with such a tactic and idea are relatively straight forward
    to analyze and document, and are most often linked to lower costs and the lowering
    of other implementation barriers. For example, it is much easier for a group of
    organizations to pool resources and information in a technically complicated area
    then to have one organization attempt to shoulder the burden individually. Additionally,
    and especially applicable for the financial services space where there is cooperation
    and a cross listing of clients and potential conflicts of interest connected to
    different classes of information, establishing a consortium model may be more
    appropriate given the nature of the industry especially as clients expect increased
    transparency and access to information.

- en: A model that creates and distributes, for lack of a better word, joint ownership
    and operating of the blockchain model creates several benefits in terms of information
    transparency, but also raises issues connected to data governance as well as liability
    concerns as well. Especially as it links to personally identifiable information
    the responsibility is increasing shifting to the organization collecting and utilizing
    this information to establish and maintain safeguards over access to this information.
    Despite the operational and potential privacy driven challenges linked with this
    information and the common platform for information storage and dissemination,
    a consortium model of blockchain development and operation does seem to emerging
    as a viable model. Whether it is connected to the lower costs per organization
    that are achievable with costs being spread around different firms, the regulatory
    ease that accompanies a common platform or model between the largest players in
    a specific space, or the desire for standardized reporting and analytical procedures
    at large, a consortium model does appear to generate benefits for those organizations
    involved. Governance and liability issues connected to different blockchain models
    and other cybersecurity issues are discussed in more depth throughout this text,
    but it seems appropriate to at least mention them here in an initial venue. Figure

    services landscape and across different industry lines, has been focused in the
    private blockchain arena due to the simple fact that the blockchain itself can
    be customized and modified to meet the needs of the specific organization. A high
    profile example of just how much work and investment are already underway in the
    private blockchain space are the collaborative work underway and developed by
    IBM, Big 4 accounting firms, and other large multinational companies. Microsoft,
    in response to investments made by IBM, Amazon, and numerous other organizations,
    has recently launched and made public a blockchain consortium tool meant to establish
    frameworks and standards in the marketplace (Hernandez [2016](#CR4)). In addition
    to leveraging and building out increased functionality and use cases with regards

    Commercial scale is the proverbial holy grail of blockchain adoption – proving
    that this technology can be scaled, adopted, and implemented even across legacy
    systems. That said, and even at the Big 4 accounting firms and investment organizations
    that have invested thousands of employees and billions of dollars in these platforms,
    there are few examples of blockchain adopted for mass market utilization. Specific
    use cases, including auditing certain classes of information and applying blockchain

    Mortgage paperwork, settling different transactions, confirming that payments
    have been made in full and to the appropriate parties, and pretty much anything
    to do with tracking and analyzing financial information involve confirming, tracking,
    and communicating large amounts of quantitative information. Instead of simply
    focusing on the technical programming aspects of how blockchain functions, a more
    appropriate conversations focuses on framing the potential of blockchain in the
    context of data verification and communication connects the technology to different
    business uses. Cryptocurrencies may have been the leading tip of the blockchain

    drive innovation and product development both in the United States and abroad
    (Lewis, McPartland and Ranjan [2017](#CR5)). An ICO, although it may sound like
    an overtly technical or abstract idea, does not differ in any substantive form,
    at a basic level, from an initial public offering. Financial services professionals
    are, almost universally, comfortable and familiar with the concept of an IPO,
    in which an organization trades ownership stakes in an organization in exchange
    for cash to fund continuing operations. An ICO operates in a similar fashion in
    terms of the implications for the organization, cash is exchanged for something
    issued by the organization, but that is where the similarities end. Instead of
    exchanging an ownership stake directly with an investor for cash, the issuing
    organization trades something a different type of asset.

    details of how a token specifically works is not the purpose of this book, but
    a basic working definition of what a token represents can be as follows. A token
    is simply an option to a right, product, service, or eventually ownership is a

    tokens can be thought of as options, which may make it easier to understand than

    an ICO is, inherently, better or more appropriate than a traditional IPO. This
    may be a difficult conversation to have with certain clients, especially if they
    are very excited about the cryptocurrency market at large, but is one that must
    be had.

    a comprehensive text on emerging trends in an emerging field such as blockchain
    or artificial intelligence, is that this technology continues to evolve and develop
    continuously. As 2018 drew to a close and turned into 2019, and the various iterations
    of the ICO market continued to mature and develop, two distinct forces began to
    intersect. First, as the volume and financial impact of ICOs continued to increase,
    regulatory attention and focus also continued to increase and develop. This increased
    scrutiny was also evident in the 2018 annual report of the S.E.C., where specific
    mention was made both of ICOs in general as well as the increased enforcement
    actions that the Commission was planning to bring to bear on the market in 2019
    and beyond. Such increased regulatory attention is, of course, a logical byproduct
    and result of the popularity of these ICOs with cryptocurrency and blockchain
    companies seeking to raise capital while also avoiding some of the compliance
    costs and paperwork associated with an IPO.

    Airdrops to assist organizations seeking to raise both capital and increase market
    awareness of the different initiatives underway. While an additional step removed
    from the regulatory and oversight jurisdiction of the S.E.C. and other regulatory
    bodies, it is also clear that the accounting, financial, and compliance issues
    associated with this process are continuing to be explored. Taxation, reporting
    the proceeds initially raised via Airdrops, and the associated implications of
    these events still remain open items as of this writing, but are assuredly topics
    being addressed and examined by various regulatory and oversight bodies. Secured
    token offerings appear to offer, to some at least, a hybridization between what
    was initially the goal and mission of the cryptocurrency space at large as traditional
    financial markets. Again, financial services professionals will not have to become
    technical experts in all aspects of the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces,
    but will have to understand both the applications built on these platforms as
    well as how they interact with traditional financial infrastructure.

    as a halfway point between a traditional IPO process and an initial coin offering
    that many blockchain based organizations have chosen to utilize. From a compliance
    and reporting perspective, the implementation and adoption of STOs in the cryptocurrency
    market may help resolve some of the current outstanding issues that currently
    may make the cryptocurrency space troublesome, confusing, or higher risk than
    other markets. A core difference between an ICO and an STO is that the token that
    is issued as a result of the STO process is backed by an underlying asset, share
    of an organization, or right to a share of organizational profits. Regardless
    of the label assigned to the tool, however, there are several key points that
    need to be considered when analyzing the STO space. Prior to examining some of
    these key points, however, one salient point that must be a part of every conversation
    regarding STO is the fact that these activities are approved by the S.E.C. Additionally,
    while many ICOs do not – in fact -grant investors any protections or share in
    management of the organization, the STO concept embraces both of these aspects.
    This may seem like a relatively simple delineation, but is a powerful difference
    in terms of both market certainty as well as the impact that these investment
    options will have on the financial conversation.

    and other token offerings in the marketplace during 2017 and 2018\. Included in
    these enforcement actions were guilty verdicts and multimillion dollar fines levied
    against both the organizations in question as well as the individuals running
    those organizations, indicating the seriousness with which regulators and oversight
    institutions are evaluating this emerging area. A secured token offering appears
    to offer a hybrid or bridge solution between an ICO or other potentially unregulated
    area and a more traditional model of capital raising. While still developing,
    this is certainly worth of consideration from a financial services perspective,

    blockchain, and financial services, the idea of a smart contract  is arguably
    the most high profile and commonly discussed next step application of the blockchain
    economy. Different blockchain networks and protocols will, clearly, have different
    approval and coding processes, but the connection between blockchain and contractual
    law are not as abstract or disparate as they may initially appear. Contract law,
    and understanding the minutia of contract law, forms an entire profession in and
    of itself, and blockchain is not going to automatically make financial professionals
    contractual law experts. That said, the automation, interconnectedness of how
    business is conducted, and the ever increasingly complexity of business and financing
    arrangements means that financial services professionals do indeed spend quite
    a bit of time dealing with contractually oriented issues.

    as to see how exactly financial services are, without a doubt, connected and linked
    to contracts, agreements, and interpreting these agreements. First, accounting
    information is, almost by default, driven by the interpretation and analysis of
    contracts, agreements, and interpretation of standards. Whether these agreements
    and contracts are based off of agreements with suppliers, customers, and partners,
    or are driven by new FASB regulations and standards the underlying trends are
    the same. CPAs and other accounting professionals often, whether working in public
    practice or employed within private industry, spend a majority of time trying
    to understand agreements and translate those agreements into financial reports.
    Second, financial markets and financial services professionals employed in the
    full spectrum of market activities (commercial lending, investment banking, trading,
    credit trading) are increasingly driven by complicated agreements between originators,
    lenders, and third parties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of individual opinion or perspective on whether or not the increased
    complexity of financial services is a value add or not, the fact remains that
    it continues to occur, and this complexity is potentially amplified by the intersection
    cryptocurrency with current outstanding accounting questions (Bruno and Gift [2019](#CR2)).
    Interpreting agreements, explaining agreements to third parties, and making sure
    that the financial ramifications are clear are core roles of any responsible fiduciary.
    This also connects this conversation back to the implications of smart contracts
    on the financial services environment; increased compliance and scrutiny. It is
    no secret that, across the globe, financial regulation has emerged as an increasingly
    hot button issue in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008\. There is an
    abundance of blame to go around, and has gone around, but something that is beyond
    dispute is that, in hindsight, there was a misunderstanding and misinterpretation
    of just what was contained within certain financial instruments. This connection
    between financial services, risk, and compliance form the basis for just how powerful
    the evolution of a smart contract market may very well be.

    or for every firm, but it is important for financial services professionals to
    be aware of just what exactly this may mean for the profession moving forward.
    For example, auditing itself may be transformed by the recording and automated
    recording of information between different organizations. For industries and situations
    that involve multiple counterparties, large amounts of paperwork, and the approval
    of multiple organizations to finalize transactions, the implementation of smart
    contracts can be a game changer. Data is what ultimately drives the decision making
    process, and the capability of different firms to process, analyze, and act on
    different pieces of data on a continuous basis may very well mean the difference
    between success and failure. Diving deeper, and realizing the applications and
    possibilities of smart contracts, it seems appropriate to take a closer look at
    what exactly these items represent.

    can certainly be very involved and detailed in nature, but the core concept of
    a contract can be summarized as follows. Regardless of industry affiliation, or
    even the specifics included in the contract, a contract can be thought of as a
    series of (IF, THEN) statements that drive business agreements going forward.
    These combinations of (IF, THEN) statements, in turn, generate obligations, ensure
    rights, and ensure that different organizations understand just what is expected
    versus what will be returned as a result of transactions. This is a simplistic

    including but not limited to supplier agreements, mortgages, or other complicated
    documents realizes that the potential for improvement is large. Linking back to
    the idea of contracts as a combination of (IF, THEN) statements, the core functionalities
    of blockchain appear to create a situation where contract applications become
    readily apparent. Blockchain technology, virtually by the very nature of how the
    technology platform functions, provides a real time platform for the communication
    and distribution of information between network members. At the current stage,
    blockchain has been developed to primarily track and monitor the flow of information
    between parties who may not necessarily trust each other. Blockchain has often
    been called the “internet of trust” or some other variation on that same theme,
    and that circles back to the consensus based model of verification at the heart
    of the platform. Contracts are, even in the friendliest of situations, between
    organizations or individuals who have conducted business previously, are put into
    place for two distinct reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, by documenting terms, conditions, obligations, and rights of the involved
    parties there is a lower risk of misunderstanding and potential future arguments
    than if agreements are simply oral in nature. Blockchain enable smart contracts
    can also help address this trust issue by requiring that all involved parties
    in the contract verify and approve the terms and conditions that have been uploaded
    onto the platform. In addition to this required verification, which by default
    increases the level of trust in the final document, access to different types
    of information can be restricted in a private blockchain environment. This might
    have seemed like a relatively small detail previously, but in the context of potentially
    sensitive contract information it is a huge issue. Since many contracts have clauses,
    amendments, and involve different organizations at a variety of levels, the ability
    to disclose only certain amounts of data to certain users is of paramount importance.
    Maintaining confidentiality over both proprietary processes as well as intellectual
    assets is of increasing importance with regards to not only how business is conducted,
    but how organizations interact with each other moving forward.

    and assign roles to involved parties also represents a significant improvement
    over how contracts are currently managed and executed. The time delay, both in
    terms of processing routine contracts and agreements as well as dealing with litigation
    issues, are an issue that law firms and legal experts are already seeking to improve
    with various technology options. While the focus and implementation of technology
    tools have currently been focused on artificial intelligence options (more on
    that later) to date, blockchain technology is also beginning to emerge as a viable
    option. Transmission of information, both in terms of improving law firm and legal
    expert efficiency as well as improving the client experience are two distinct
    and quantitative benefits that can, and should be, realized both by individual
    lawyers and law firms. Reducing or even eliminating altogether the internal float
    related to documents and document analysis is a real upside of how blockchain
    can help with the pain points that are often the source of complaints from clients
    and lawyers alike.

- en: Third, and building on the first two data points, is the importance and integration
    of encryption into the communication process. Data transmission, no matter how
    efficient in nature, will not add any value to the business process if that communication
    and data is hacked, stolen, breached, or otherwise exposed to the marketplace.
    This is not merely a routine warning about making sure to change your passwords;
    the business of data hacking, breaches, and the impact on both organizations and
    individuals is a big business. Whether it is state sponsored hacking and actors,
    corporate espionage, or individuals launching ransomware attacks for personal
    gain the underlying realities remain the same. As soon as data is breached and/or
    exposed to the broader marketplace there are negative consequences for both the
    institutions that have been hacked and the individuals whose information has exposed
    to nefarious actors. As the blockchain itself, in its various iterations, has
    not been hacked to date, this extra layer of security and encryption will invariably
    add security and protection to legal transactions. It important to draw a fine
    line at this point, however, and acknowledge the reality that blockchain affiliated
    exchanges and organizations have been breached, hacked, and otherwise compromised.
  prefs: []

- en: With all of this said, the combination of real time communication, encryption,
    and requiring that all contractual terms be underpinned by consensus based verification
    must still be viewed as what they are; prototypes and experimental programs. It
    is true that the blockchain itself has not been hacked, but numerous applications
    and portals that lay at the intersection of blockchain technology with the rest
    of the internet have been breached. Cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets that hold
    cryptocurrencies, and other applications built on blockchain technology have all
    suffered hacks, some of them leading to downfall of these programs and organizations.
    Smart contracts represent merely the next and more comprehensive application and
    program built on the underlying blockchain, so it is important to recognize the
    fact that any store place of information will always be a target for hackers and
    data breaches.

- en: The bitcoin blockchain, which provides the foundation for the lightning network
    itself, has several problems and issues that have limited how broadly cryptocurrencies
    and the wider blockchain marketplace can be adopted. Delays in processing time,
    the sheer amount of computing power and electricity required to process, record,
    and transmit blockchain and bitcoin transactions, and the technical requirements
    to actually do so limit how useful this technology may actually be. Now, this
    analysis focuses on the lightning network for the following reason – the bitcoin
    blockchain is the largest, most well established, and most widely used blockchain
    network on a global basis. Developing this lightning network may have originated
    as a way to facilitate the transmission of bitcoin and associated bitcoin information,
    but there will inevitably be implications for other blockchain based transactions.
    Let’s take a look at what exactly a lightning network represents, and what this
    means for financial services professionals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lightning network is, for lack of a better analogy, a way in which to conduct
    business and transactions – using cryptocurrency – without having the time lags
    and massive electrical consumption that is currently associated with traditional
    Bitcoin transactions. Framed in the context of business transactions, a lightning
    network would seem most appropriate and make the most sense for circumstances
    where two institutions or individuals conduct a high level of business with each
    other. For example, two suppliers or banks or any other components of a supply
    chain environment that do business on a daily basis would make sense in this situation,
    and appear to be a good fit for a lightning network. Since these institutions
    or individuals already know each other, have some level of trust based on prior
    transaction history, and do business on a continuous basis, the thinking goes
    that not every single piece of data or transaction has to touch the blockchain
    proper. After determining the appropriateness of a situation for the development
    and implementation of a lightning network, the next step in the conversation should
    focus on how just to get this idea up and running.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This may seem like a relatively simple concept to understand in theory, but
    represents a tectonic shift in how bitcoin, other blockchain financial transactions,
    and how these transactions can be identified. Instead of relying entirely on a
    decentralized and semi-anonymous basis for transacting and communicating information
    back and forth, a lightning network (as is currently constituted), a lightning
    network does require that the counterparties identify each other. While this does
    eliminate some of the benefits and upsides of the initial blockchain conversation,
    this actually does make blockchain more applicable and useful for financial services
    transactions. Identifying the parties, be they individuals or institutions, involved
    in the transactions in question also allows blockchain to be in more compliance
    with regulations such as anti-money laundering and know your customer laws and
    regulations. Adapting to, and remaining in compliance with, these financial regulations
    is essential for obtaining a wider adoption of blockchain for financial services
    purposes.

- en: Boiling the concept down to basic terminology, the next step would be to open
    something called a payment channel (more on that in a minute) and record the opening
    of this channel on the blockchain. Now transactions can pass between the institutions
    or individuals, via this channel, without having to touch the blockchain until
    the payment channel is closed. Such a channel could remain open for hours, days,
    weeks, or even years; the specific time allotted is irrelevant. Only at the closing
    of this channel, whenever that may occur, would a final tallying of transactions
    be recorded onto the blockchain itself. Now, this does undermine some of the very
    security and privacy options that make using blockchain attractive and the focus
    of such large levels of analysis and investment, but it also appears to address
    some of the issues that are preventing blockchain from scaling and taking a leadership
    position in the marketplace. Introducing the concept of a payment channel caused
    shockwaves throughout the blockchain landscape due to the simple reality that
    this appeared to solve a fundamental issue associated with the bitcoin blockchain.
    Simply stated, the time lag and delay associated with bitcoin and the bitcoin
    blockchain was going to remain. Now, there was a new term introduced here as well,
    the idea of a payment channel, so let’s drill down and see just what exactly this
    means.

- en: The core of the payment channel idea is not something that is entirely unrelated
    to the name of this technical aspect of blockchain technology. Put simply, a payment
    channel is an off-chain network that runs parallel to the blockchain itself. In
    other words, these transactions and the associated information linked to these
    transactions are not directly stored on the blockchain at every single instant.
    Such an arrangement addresses some of the current shortcomings associated with
    this technology, including the lag in processing speed and the amount of time
    that is spent processing certain transactions. Using smart contracts (remember
    those are automated agreements that have been embedded into the blockchain chain),
    it allows two or more connected parties to perform transactions without having
    to broadcast every transactions to the network. Conversely, during the lifetime
    of the payment channel – which again can range from days to years – the individual
    transactions are stored off-chain. When the chain is closed, the final balance
    is mined/confirmed, and then added to the blockchain itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Putting this concept into practice represents the next logical step in the payment
    channel conversation. Namely, how does a firm or individual actually go about
    putting this concept into practice? If two individuals or institutions would like
    to arrange and use a payment channel the first step in that process is to deposit
    funds into the channel. Sticking with Bitcoin, which supports the lightning network,
    the individuals or institutions would deposit BTC into the channel. Using the
    “multi-sig” address, allowing the multiple parties to send and receive BTC or
    other information between each other, and waiting until the transactions have
    concluded before broadcasting these changes to the network itself would complete
    the establishment of a channel. Potentially even more profound for the finance
    and transactions landscape is the individuals or institutions do not need to have
    direct channels between each other for the payment channel to function properly.
    As long as there is a path, using existing channels, that already exists for the
    individual or institution to transact with someone else, the payment channel protocol
    is something that can be used. The closing process itself, of any payment channel
    that has been constructed and used by multiple organizations or individuals, can
    be accomplished by any single entity that is a part of that channel. Contrasted
    with using the full blockchain to verify and post blocks of transactions, there
    are several benefits readily apparent from the utilization of a lightning based
    network.

    that the vast majority of airdrops occur or are led by organizations that are
    seeking to launch a new coin and/or raise funding from the marketplace. For example,
    an organization seeking to launch a new cryptocurrency – let’s call it NewCoin –
    wants to gain users, increase awareness of their product, and create a market
    for future trading. They might airdrop a certain number coins (1,10, or 100 would
    all work the same way) – to the public address of bitcoin holders on the bitcoin
    blockchain. Through no action on the part of bitcoin holders, these holders now
    have access to these new coins; which all should seem like a relatively simple
    process. Now, items that might be driving questions and considerations as airdrops
    have been receiving more and more coverage in the marketplace, the following questions
    are inevitably being asked.

- en: How should airdrops be taxed? The taxation of cryptocurrencies, especially those
    interested in the intersection of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, is something
    that is of particular importance for financial services professionals. Taxes,
    although not usually something that is a fun or enjoyable conversation between
    financial professionals and clients, is a part of any accounting or advisory engagement.
    Drilling down, as airdrops become more and more commonplace in the marketplace,
    both as an alternative to ICOs and as a method for creating markets for cryptocurrencies,
    the tax regulation in this space will become an increasingly important issue.
    One of the most important questions to address is as follows is how these emerging
    topics are going to intersect and engage with the blockchain ecosystem.

- en: Chapter [4](467992_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml) dives right into one of the most important
    topics and characteristics as it connects to blockchain and crypro to both broader
    technology trends as well as the implications these technologies have for accounting
    and other financial services. Blockchain is arguably the hottest and highest profile
    topics that has entered the finance and accounting vernacular during the last
    several years, but even with this significant amount of coverage there seems to
    remain a gap in understanding and comprehension on the side of both clients and
    practitioners. This chapter seeks to differentiate the different types of blockchain
    options available in the marketplace as well the methods by which data can be
    validated and verified by the network itself. Establishing these differences is
    important since these form the core of the platform and do make it stand out in
    an objective and quantifiable way from other databased options. Versus almost
    every other data entry or storage system in the world, which operates on a centralized
    basis, uploading and the storing of data onto a blockchain platform requires that
    at least a portion of the network members approve and verify the data as it is
    uploaded. The specifics will vary from blockchain to blockchain, but the overall
    common theme of group based data verification are consistent across blockchain
    platforms. This chapter drills into the specific types of consensus approval methodologies
    that exist in the marketplace as well as analyzing what these different methodologies
    mean for business transactions.
