    of today, it stores identical blocks of information across its network. For this
    reason, a blockchain cannot be controlled by any single entity nor does it have
    a single point of failure. By storing data across its network, the blockchain
    eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally. Blockchain networks
    lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer hackers can exploit easily.

    rely on username and password credentials to access our assets online. Blockchain
    uses encryption technology to improve security. By allowing data and information
    to be widely distributed, blockchain technology has created the backbone of the
    new Internet, web3\. Though it was originally devised for the digital currency
    Bitcoin, the business and technology communities are finding many uses for blockchain.
    Knowledge of this new technology will be required by not only programmers but
    by all businesses. In the next five to ten years, blockchain will change the business
    models in all types of industries—and perhaps change the way people work and live.

    on Wall Street circa 1974\. We have used and written about the evolving technology
    tools starting with IBM Assembler, Fortran, COBOL, and data access methods like
    QSAM, BDAM, and VSAM, all the way to present-day REST web services, Java, and
    SQL and everything in between (including client/server tools like PowerBuilder).
    We have been fortunate in that our passions for learning and becoming proficient
    in each new and emerging technology have served us well in the business community.
    We recognized blockchain technology as an ingenious invention, as it combines
    the best of what came before it in database design, cryptography, and virtual
    machine containers with the very capable distributed computing environment of
    today. Our passion for the technology was based on love at first sight. We have
    brought together a robust network of blockchain entrepreneurs, fellow blockchain
    technologists, and others who have made critical contributions to the coverage
    and text of this book.

    blockchain technology and its use cases. That said, there is a sequence whereby
    each chapter builds on the previous chapters to provide a solid conceptual understanding
    of blockchain. This is coupled with a comprehensive treatment for getting started
    as a designer and developer of blockchain applications. This includes the Ethereum
    technology stack and code, and deployment techniques and examples, including an
    entire application from code start to deployment finish.

- en: In **[Chapter 1](ch1.xhtml#ch1)**, we provide an overview of everything blockchain.
    We introduce it as a distributed database technology with the capability to execute
    smart contracts. The expanding universe of blockchain application is covered.
    The efficiencies and cost savings provided by blockchain technologies—especially
    the private blockchains adopted by the financial community—are also briefly examined.
    In parallel, the use of blockchain is shown to affect global transactions, and
    this will push it forward toward maturity. Blockchain and its timing are critical
    to maintaining global transactions and providing trust in the integrity of those
    transactions. For these reasons and more, we argue that blockchain is here to
    stay, and the chapters herein will provide you with a comprehensive map and toolset
    with what you need as a designer or developer to successfully make the trip.

    and Ethereum, it clearly is a technology with widespread applicability in many
    sectors of business. **[Chapter 2](ch2.xhtml#ch2)** gives some depth to real-world
    use cases in the financial services industry, including sections on cryptocurrency
    and digital tokens. We then show how common business use cases ultimately lead
    to faster throughput, reduced costs, improved accuracy, greater transparency,
    and quality, reliability, simplicity, and traceability.

    be used in conjunction in the not-too-distant future of blockchain technology.
    [Chapter 2](ch2.xhtml#ch2) closes with how blockchain and the Internet of Things
    (IoT) will have a consortium of startups and companies to help define and refine
    security and interoperability, management, and coordination between connected
    devices. While IoT is still in its early stages of evolution and currently comprises
    mostly technologies that either collect data or allow remote monitoring and control,
    this will change as devices become smarter and artificial intelligence is added.
    This network of things will transition toward becoming a network of autonomous
    devices that talk to each other and (hopefully) make smart decisions without the
    need for human intervention or interpretation. In short, we live in exciting times
    for blockchain technology.

    3.0 architecture. Distributed networking and storage are happening now and promise
    solutions that could save the global economy trillions annually. The Web today
    needs a new security model and an architecture designed around contemporary use
    cases. The technology stack is just beginning to emerge. It includes Swarm, IPFS,
    Storj, Golem, and Whisper, just to mention a few of a growing number of components
    that represent the most ambitious solutions to this problem.'

    unforeseen opportunities will open before us. New tools will change not only the
    way we work and use web conveniences but also the way we organize ourselves in
    groups. We are living in an interesting time in history, where the Web begins
    to bring more knowledge and action capacity for its users, resulting in considerable
    changes in several aspects of daily life. This new Web is moving fast toward a
    more dynamic environment, where the democratization of the capacity of action
    and knowledge can speed up business in almost all areas. Imagine a future with
    hundreds of real decentralized applications—for example, one in charge of registering
    land titles and mortgages and handling local taxes, and a more general application
    in charge of managing the supply chain of registered tenants, their monthly lease
    payments, as well as mortgage and expense payments. One could easily link information
    from properties registered in the first application with the tenants and their
    use of the properties registered in the second application. All this in an easy
    way using the whole stack of semantic web technology and—something that is not
    possible to date—ensuring that all data is 100 percent true, guaranteed by the
    smart contracts. The real questions we must ask are: How will the world of Web
    3.0 differ from the world of Web 2.0? How will this technology penetrate beyond
    the cultures that created it? One thing is for sure: blockchain will be at the
    center of this new world.'

    show that smart contracts may be the most transformative current blockchain component,
    especially for lawyers. We explore why Professors Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani
    of the Harvard Business School said:'

    happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers
    and accountants? … Their roles would all radically change… . [W]e are decades
    away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts… . A tremendous degree of
    coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented,
    and enforced will be required. We believe the institutions responsible for those
    daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve. And the technology challenges—especially
    security—are daunting… . [L]aw firms will have to change to make smart contracts
    viable. They’ll need to develop new expertise in software and blockchain programming.”

    way we interact and exchange information, and as such brings forth challenging
    and complex legal issues and pushes the boundaries of existing laws. We see that
    blockchain technology is something that our laws will have to adapt to, just as
    they adapted to the Internet, medical technology, e-discovery, and social media.
    There is a huge change before us as lawyers and as developers to embrace it and
    be part of its evolution.

    but also in each state here in the United States. Businesses operating in regulated
    industries should seek guidance from their regulators before integrating critical,
    customer-facing, or data-handling processes with platforms like Ethereum. We examine
    the large strides made in the financial services arena with private and consortium
    varieties of blockchain. We see clearly that this is an indication that financial
    institutions are playing in and watching this space very closely.

    blockchain solutions. We review private blockchain technology such as Hyperledger,
    Monax, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, and the Hyperledger tools Cello,
    Composer, and Explorer. We explore the many options for permissioned private blockchains
    and show why the list is likely to grow. In many cases, government/industry regulation
    dictates that private control will be needed. That being said, the freedom, neutrality,
    and openness that started Bitcoin on the public blockchain are important to keep
    in mind. The focus of decentralizing control and consensus on the public platform
    is clearly something to think about. There is a great deal of chatter and concern
    around privacy, identity, speed, and cost of the public blockchain solutions.
    It is important to note that by creating privately administered smart contracts
    on public blockchains, or cross-chain exchange layers that sit in between public
    and private blockchains, it is possible to deliver some degree of the properties
    of private blockchains on the public platforms. Time will tell if these types
    of capabilities and properties ever get built into the public blockchain.

    an entire application and explain each line of code and every setup move required
    to build the application.

    built in [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#ch10). We also step through the development of
    a simple front end to run the application. If you have read, understood, and tried
    some of the code in this chapter, you can now write new scripts to deploy and
    test your own smart contracts. You can create a contract, and you can create a
    front end to interact with it. In short, once you get through this whole book,
    you will be ready to design, code, test, and deploy an Ethereum blockchain application.
