    with the highlights reel for days afterward, the pain of your public embarrassment
    diminishes when you bomb again, setting off a fresh round of anguish.

    gift: what President Barack Obama called “fearlessness.”^([60](notes.html#ch00-fn60))'

    hall filled with blockchain investors eager to hear how to make money. I was nervous—not
    so much about the size of the audience as about what I was going to say.

    the Winklevoss twins, who took the money they won from suing Mark Zuckerberg for
    stealing Facebook, then plowed it into bitcoin. But they didn’t just buy; they
    held. Every time the market melted down, they held. They even had a mantra: “Spartans
    hold.”'

    Take Vitalik Buterin, the nineteen-year-old genius who saw that blockchain could
    be used not just for bitcoin but for decentralized applications (or dapps). He
    invented a platform for blockchain development—not to get rich, but to make something
    valuable. Investors made him rich anyway, pouring billions into Ethereum.

    have to work anymore. What do they do? They reinvest that money into new blockchain
    projects. It’s like building hotels on St. James Place in Monopoly, which generates
    revenue for you to reinvest in your Marvin Gardens hotels, and that lets you build
    hotels on Boardwalk. Game over.
