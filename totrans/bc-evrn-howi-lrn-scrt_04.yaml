    glassy-eyed tellers manage the line of lunchtime customers like a snake slowly
    digesting field mice. I had opened an account here in college; ten bank mergers
    later, they held our personal and business accounts, home mortgage, and line of
    credit.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In 2008 a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto published an online paper
    titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” In it, he outlined his
    vision for a new type of electronic money. Imagine a world where sending money
    to other people would be as easy as sending email.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Electronic money had been tried in the past, but it usually failed because
    it’s easy to copy things on the Internet: sound files, videos, classified government
    documents. Satoshi’s idea was to marry together a few new technologies—cryptography,
    peer-to-peer file sharing, and blockchain—to make digital cash that was trustworthy
    and secure.'

    that lets people send money as easily as sending email.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No one knew who Satoshi was, but since it was the Internet, no one really cared.
    Over the next two years he built out the technology for bitcoin, attracting a
    small core of programmers who helped him test, develop, and refine it. In return
    for their work on the project, they were rewarded with small amounts of bitcoin,
    which at the time were worth nothing except bragging rights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No one ever met Satoshi, because he communicated only through online forums
    and email. Meanwhile, the bitcoin network began to grow in size and power. Like
    the Internet, bitcoin ran on a shared network of computers, and “miners” who contributed
    computing power to the network were rewarded with small amounts of bitcoin, which
    were still worth nothing except bragging rights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This created a virtuous circle: now miners were being “paid” in bitcoin, which
    created an incentive to contribute more computing power, because what if this
    bitcoin became worth something someday?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Satoshi worked tirelessly behind the scenes, fixing bugs, suggesting improvements,
    herding the cats. But no one ever met him face-to-face. Things grew even more
    mysterious in 2010, when Satoshi began transferring over all the source code to
    his developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then he disappeared.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He left behind several personal accounts containing at least one million bitcoin,^([1](notes.html#ch00-fn1))
    which seven years later would be worth over 19 billion dollars. And he never came
    back to claim it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Who does that? Who creates a world-changing technology, then disappears, leaving
    behind a fortune?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The nature of bitcoin is that people can see what’s in his account—like a transparent
    bank vault—but no one can touch it without his permission. The nature of bitcoin
    is also that no bank “holds” bitcoin, so Satoshi can stay safely anonymous. His
    unclaimed fortune is still out there, frozen in time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of Satoshi. Everyone from conspiracy theorists to linguistic analysts have pored
    over every message he ever sent, trying to determine his nationality or even just
    his time zone.

    named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. (He denied it.) Even the world’s top investigative

    Or a government. Or aliens! No one knows for sure.
