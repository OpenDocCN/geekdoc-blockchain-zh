- en: Technologies shaping the future, Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data, are
    the leading research topics in the computer science department. Every field like
    this is prone to attacks from hackers and adversaries, which is why there is a
    need for proper security method implementations. The current nature of the Internet
    of Things uses centralized servers for data collection and analysis requirements,
    which invites many security concerns. Similarly, big data deals with a huge amount
    of data that is processed and analyzed every day. The blockchain network can fill
    this need for a better security solution. Even though it is in its infancy but
    due to the features, such as Decentralization, Persistency, Anonymity, and Auditability,
    it is able to strengthen the security of the various IoT and big data applications.
    This paper discusses the security flaws in the existing centralized infrastructure
    used by the above technologies and presents the security solution to solve the
    flaws.

- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of interconnected computing devices,
    mechanical and digital computers, objects, animals, or unique identifiers (UIDs)
    that can transmit information over a network from one person or without the need
    for human-computer interaction. However, it comes with many security issues that
    have many similarities with the security of IT [[1](#r1)]. Many current IoT networks
    rely on centralized networking modes for connecting to servers or cloud services
    for data processing and storage. The fear is that the server will become a bottleneck
    and a new target for cyber-attack, as well as a failure point that will disrupt
    the whole network and harm the consistency of the tests. Consequently, it remains
    complicated how to create a fully reliable and interconnected ecosystem to support
    such embedded devices and computer resources for data transmission [[1](#r1)].

    do with the said critical information. Some users use this info for their own
    gain and do selfish mining or share private information with companies. So, to
    overcome these issues with IoT and Big data, blockchain is implemented [[2](#r2)].
    Blockchain is a decentralized system, which removes the use of a third party in
    a transaction thereby creating a peer-to-peer connection. It is based on functionalities
    like encryption, decentralization, immutability, and transparency. All the data
    stored in a blockchain is coupled in blocks like a database. All the transactions
    are connected with nodes. When a new transaction appears, the sender via a peer-to-peer
    network communicates it to all the different nodes. As the transactions are being
    validated, it is stored in the transactional pool. When the transactions are being
    validated in the pool, miners create a new block and store all the transactions
    thereafter which the block is mined [[2](#r2)].

    also tells about the possible security problems that are associated while implementing
    blockchain. This paper also gives some possible solutions to these problems. There
    are various examples to elaborate the idea of implementing and its various outcomes
    in this paper. We review some of the alternatives given by other papers like cloud-based
    drone systems for data collection [[3](#r3)] and Fair Access [[4](#r4)]. The paper
    focuses on the security solutions based on blockchain designed for an IoT network.
    These approaches include the security maintenance of IoT computers, safe firmware
    upgrades, and trust verification of a trustworthy computer base, authentication
    of IoT device identity, and secure data store access to control information systems.
    The paper also focuses on a Blockchain-based IoT Device Security Architecture
    in Smart Homes where the architecture consists of three levels, namely local smart
    home networks, an overlay network, and cloud storage [[1](#r1)]. Entities use
    blockchain transfers for coordination between themselves in each stage. This paper
    reflects on the IoT blockchain platform by analyzing future data interruptions
    and security issues during the interaction with IoT components. These security
    issues include confidentiality of data, lack of resources for design practices,
    inadequate information on upgrade and maintenance [[5](#r5)].

    and security threats like lack of optimally controlled role in communication between
    the devices in the IoT to prevent hijacking and cyberattacks, fairness in data
    collection and use, and identification in IoT. These challenges can be solved
    by blockchain as it enables a decentralized or a distributed network. However,
    it also brings out challenges like a proper ledger storage facility, severe inadequacy
    of appropriate legal standards, and limited research in the technology. Karafiloski
    *et al.* [[7](#r7)] discuss some major characteristics that build up a blockchain
    network such as auditability, anonymity, persistency, and decentralization. These
    characteristics help to build a secure network, which can be used for Big Data
    and IoT. A proper consensus algorithm is key to a successful blockchain network.
    An efficient consensus algorithm provides safety and convenience. There are also
    the same challenges that occur while using a blockchain network some of which
    are scalability and privacy leakage (Table [**1**](#t1)).

    accessible to the public that stores all the executed transactions in the system.
    The way forward in big data using blockchain is combining blockchain with smart
    contracts. Blockchain combined with smart contracts can contribute to inventing
    the next era of application with a more established security and verification
    system. When users build and post data, they will also remain primary data owners.
    With respect to the surveillance that is achieved by recording the behavior and
    desires of users, users should at least have knowledge of it and any advantages.
    The Blockchain can be a proxy for privacy control rights or a completely autonomous
    social network can be introduced. Blockchain provides user control of all data
    and transactions they make. While preventing any checks from third parties. This
    definition may affect Big Data in seeking a solution for the distributed storage
    and management of data on a P2P network.

    arbitrator on a centralized network for coordinating transactions among entities
    (Table [**1**](#t1)). Blockchain bases its implementation on four main ideas;
    mining, distributed public ledger, ledger copies Synchronization, and a peer-to-peer
    network. Merging blockchain and IoT helps support peer-to-peer communication enabling
    autonomy and thus removing all the bottlenecks that would have occurred otherwise.
    IoT and blockchain mergers can be viable solutions for both economic efficiency
    and business needs. Blockchain is always not a good idea for an architecture base
    it depends on the type of application, which demands the use of features of the
    blockchain.

    *et al*., [[10](#r10)], we see a green proof of collaboration consensus mechanism.
    The key concept of proof of collaboration is that participants contribute to the
    sharing of big data so that they can also benefit from the collaboration of other
    participants. While blockchain brings so many exciting features such as decentralization
    and immutability, the restricted computing resources, network, and computer storage
    resources present challenges to the blockchain architecture.

    any non-trustworthy part of the network can tamper with the information provided
    in line with their own interests, thus feeding unreliable information in the system.
    To solve this, we have to implement a distributed network using blockchain, which
    is trusted by all its participants that guarantees the immutability of the data.
    Blockchain provides the decentralization and security required for a secure IoT.
    Integration of blockchain improves the following; Decentralization, Market of
    services, Identity, Autonomy, scalability, Reliability, Security, and Secure code
    deployment. Even though Blockchain is a good alternative to the centralized cloud-based

    the consensus mechanism itself has 51% vulnerability, and then the adversaries
    exploit this vulnerability to take control of the blockchain network and other
    problems like double spending, transaction privacy leakage, and private key security.

    blockchain-based vehicle safety architecture. BC inherits the anonymity of the
    current system, where each node uses a special private key that communicates with
    other overlay nodes. So, an overlay node protects overlay nodes from being registered.
    To store data that is subject to the privacy, each vehicle is fitted with in-vehicle
    storage. The architecture supports evolving automotive technologies by offering
    a safe way to exchange data while offering end-user security. The focus of the
    proposed architecture called Lightweight Scalable Blockchain is to create a decentralized
    privacy-preserving and secure blockchain-based architecture for the smart vehicles,
    which have a low overhead. The paper also discussed various applications pertaining

    a single ACE authorization server blockchain. The said blockchain handles demands

    for the self-healing community is used for the effective multicasting of IoT resources.

    program. Owing to its heavily secure nature achieved with sophisticated cryptography,
    the information contained in the global public ledger is resistant to any tampering.
    And the system seeks cybersecurity uses. As centralized systems are getting rid

    also focuses on the need for publicly accessible datasets, as the position of
    real-world datasets in evaluating the proposed protection strategy cannot be overestimated,
    especially predictive. The need for safe storage of publicly accessible IoT databases
    in order to establish a specification for these databases using blockchain technology
    in order to maintain transparency of shared data. The future of the blockchain

    theft attacks. When any of the systems connecting to the IoT network was infected,
    the whole network and the associated system may also be affected. In the blockchain,
    it is impossible to alter a transaction that has already been accepted to make

    where every device is running one or more than one bot and are in control by the
    attacker. They are used to perform various types of illicit attacks, one of the
    main being Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks as the adversary has full
    access to the affected devices [[32](#r32)]. It becomes more dangerous as a user
    may be unknown if their device is part of a botnet. Botnets are made by attacking
    the weak point of a device in the IoT network and exposing its vulnerability.
    After the vulnerability is exposed, the attacker gains access to the device and
    continues to affect the other devices in the network as they are in a centralized
    network creating a botnet. One of the most famous and known examples of a botnet

    the user’s data to lock them out of their own files, and then the attacker demands
    a ransom for the removal of the said malware [[36](#r36)]. In terms of IoT, the
    ransomware attack could be more than just locking out the victim but could jeopardize
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability [[37](#r37)]. The Internet Crime
    Complaint Center (IC3) reported a loss of around $8.9 million in the year 2019
    alone. One example is the WannaCry / WannaDecryptor; it is a form of ransomware
    called crypto-ransomware that applies encryption and decryption algorithms to
    computer data, and it is riskier if it targets back-end application servers because
    IoT devices at the forefront do not contain a significant amount of data [[37](#r37)].'

    embedded or connected with these devices. Hence, it is important the integrity
    of this data is protected and authentic. This is where the challenges arise *i.e.*
    to maintain the data integrity. It becomes all the more important as some of the

    to catch the malicious botnets incurring illicit activities. They proposed an
    Auto Bot Catcher, which uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) blockchain in a
    permissioned setting that detects the bots by processing the network flow data.
    The use of BFT is explained by its characteristics of assigning the role of generating
    block to a small set of actors. Using the blockchain in a permitted setting helps
    to keep adversaries'' stored network data confidential, as only a certain set
    of pre-identified block generators can access the above data. BFT approach follows
    the two-thirds consensus protocol, *i.e.* to reach consensus on the current set
    of rules introduced by one of the block generators, which at least two-thirds
    of the pre-identified block generators have to decide upon. The set of rules is
    the same mutual contact graph, set of blocks processed, and community mapping
    of IoT devices within this proposed mechanism. The AutoBotCatcher is comprised
    of two entities Agents, who monitor the network traffic flow, and block generators
    who as the name suggests, are part of the consensus and block generation process.'

    the pre-processing of determining whether the IP address belongs to the *blacklist*
    and *whitelist* maintained by agents. If a blacklisted IP address is detected,
    then agents sever the network connection or force it to shut down essentially
    quarantining it. After the generation of the mutual contact graph, it is analyzed
    by performing Dynamic Community Discovery (DCD) using the Louvain method [[22](#r22)]
    but by giving it, the community set of IoT devices from the previous state. Then
    it performs two checks perturbation check and botnet check for old and new communities
    respectively. A perturbation check is performed to add or remove the IP addresses
    from the blacklist based on them being a part of a botnet managed by the block
    manager. Whereas, botnet check classifies the new communities either as a botnet
    community or as a safe community also managed by the block manager. The last stage
    consists of the block manager updating the blacklist from the identified bots
    and simultaneously updating the blacklist of all IoT devices using a smart contract.

    malicious ports or IP addresses. However, if any advanced malware breaks through
    then the blockchain smart contract check three main things: System Calls; Authenticity;
    Access Control. If the software behaves normally like read/write file or query
    a file then it is deemed as a normal user behavior but the access of sensitive
    information like network information or kernel level information, the user is
    alerted of malicious software in the system. The user then gives it appropriate
    permission to execute if it is non-malicious software. The flagged aforementioned
    software may try to make malicious system calls to encrypt or gain control of
    the desktop then the blockchain will stop the process in all the devices except
    both the honeypot devices if it safely runs on those devices and no ransom calls
    are made the software is deemed as non-malicious. However, if a ransom call is
    made then it is flagged as malicious software, and the software is uninstalled
    from the device, and honeypot devices are updated with new rules. This framework
    also supports a backup feature, which uses the blockchain cloud infrastructure.'

    blockchain to make an IoT-based Blockchain Platform. Similar to the previously
    discussed solutions, this is also heavily based on the use of smart contracts.
    The smart contracts mentioned in the paper contains five fields: Device owner
    registration function; Device registration function; Sensor reading function;
    Actuator Writing Function; Event Notification. This smart contract is connected
    to the ledger, which receives ledger updates and sends back update results. The
    ledger and the smart contract make the IoT-Blockchain network and is connected
    to the application client, which executes the smart contract and receives ledger
    updates. When a new device is added to the network, the client registers the device
    invoking the device registration transaction mentioned in the aforementioned smart
    contract. After that consensus, a process is held and each peer updates his or
    her blockchain with this new transaction followed by the client being informed
    of the transaction’s execution. When the device is successfully registered, the
    device owner can deploy a task to be done by a particular device. The targeted
    device after executing the task sends the result to both the server and blockchain.
    The blockchain then updates the distributed ledger of each peer and sends the
    result to the device. In addition, alerting the device owner if the pre-defined

    method where several encapsulated regions containing a number of IoT devices are
    made. In these regions, the IoT device can trust each other but IoT devices in
    two different regions cannot access each other. This region is called a bubble
    in the proposed architecture. All of this is achieved by the use of public blockchain-enabled
    smart contracts. This bubble comprises two major components, Master and Follower.
    Master is appointed in the initialization phase (it can be any device) and has
    a public/private key. Whereas, followers create an elliptic curve private/public
    key and have a ticket in the form of structure data type detailing the follower’s
    group ID, Object ID, Public Address, and a Signature created using master’s private
    key. In summary, in the initialization phase master selects a group ID and provides
    the object with its signed tickets. Master then relays a transaction, which consists
    of the master’s identifier (Object ID) and group identifier (Group ID) of the
    group to be created, and upon the verification of the uniqueness of both the aforementioned
    identifiers, the bubble is created. After the master creates the bubble, followers
    relay their transaction to join their desired bubbles. Here, the uniqueness of
    the follower’s identifier (Object ID) is verified by the smart contract along
    with the verification of its ticket, which is done by using the master’s public
    key. Upon successful first transaction of a follower, the authenticity of the
    follower is established and a ticket is not needed for authentication.'

    It is worth noting that none of the examples given are based on blockchain proposals
    for IoT security systems which offers complete defense against all future risks
    and attacks to health. In fact, the realistic application of such defense technologies
    is also a matter of the future. Some challenges remain, such as consensus models,
    mining block computational costs, and transaction validation. Blockchain applications
    often offer solutions, which require significant modifications or complete replacement
    of existing systems. Therefore, the transfer is not going to be easy and quick.
    However, we are still in the early stages of blockchain development, and eventually,
    these obstacles will be overcome, paving the way for many exciting possibilities.
