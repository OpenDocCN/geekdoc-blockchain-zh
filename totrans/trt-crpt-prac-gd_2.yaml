    that was (and still is). That led to Internet 2.0 (more commonly called IoT, the

    checkbook is a ledger. So is an Excel spreadsheet. Both are private; you alone
    have access to them, and you alone decide who gets to see the information. If
    you want to cheat, you can create a second ledger with false information—and you
    can show the fake one to others instead of showing your real ledger. (This is
    known as a “second set of books” and was Al Capone’s downfall.)

    to everyone who has an internet connection, which is why blockchain is also known

    anyone can see it anytime, for free (simply visit [https://www.blockchain.com/explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)).

    you sign the sales contract, you hire a settlement attorney to conduct a title
    search—to verify that the seller really does own the deed and has the legal right
    to sell it to you. Then, you buy title insurance in case the title search was
    flawed. Meanwhile, you apply for a mortgage and the lender verifies that you really
    do have the income and assets you claim to have. All this adds months and tens
    of thousands of dollars to the transaction—and none of that increases the value
    of the house. You’re spending money on verification because we operate in a *trust

    who wrote a white paper describing the idea in 2008.^([I](#footnote-071)) Actually,
    we can thank Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber. They met at Bell Labs. Scott holds
    a PhD in theoretical physics from Stanford; Stuart has a PhD in computer science
    from Columbia. They coauthored pioneering papers describing their concept in 1991
    (receiving the 1992 Discover Award for Computer Software). Of the eight citations
    in Satoshi’s 2008 white paper, three reference Scott and Stu’s work.^([II](#footnote-070))

    money, but no one will accept the check as payment. They don’t know if the check
    is real or whether Grandma really has fifty bucks in her account to cover it.
    (There’s that *trust* thing again.) So, you deposit the check into your bank account
    and wait for it to clear. You then withdraw the money so you can spend it.

    to the teller. Goodbye, check; hello, increase in your bank balance. Then, in

    simply snapped a picture with your phone and emailed the photo to the bank.

    branch—your account would have $100, not just $50\. Make a quick withdrawal before
    the bank realizes what you’ve done, and you’ve doubled your money.
