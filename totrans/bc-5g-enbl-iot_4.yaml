- en: The healthcare industry is that sector of the economy that provides healthcare
    goods and services to treat people or the patients with rehabilitative and curative
    care. Healthcare industries are termed as one of the largest and fastest growing
    industries that consume most part of the economy.

- en: The healthcare services are governed by the private hospitals, government hospitals,
    and private clinics. Most people prefer private clinics as they are convenient
    to visit and provide hassle-free care to its patients. Healthcare systems presently
    functional are managed by various authorities and laws as put down by state and
    central government; sometimes, services provided are not up to the mark leading
    to improper care of the patients, citing availability of experts, infrastructure
    facilities, population density, and remote location as primary reasons. The private
    sector surpassed the public sector in terms of the healthcare services, and it
    became a preferred choice of the patients as they gave more assurance to their
    consumers.

- en: The healthcare industry is growing at a rapid pace during these years due to
    the increase in the income of the people and the growing population of the elderly
    people. Elder people play a major role in the expansion of the healthcare sector
    as this section of the society needs more care and convenience than the people
    of any other age group. In addition to these, the changing demographics as well
    as new lifestyle has led to the outburst of diseases which in turn have led to
    vast research and development in this field. Despite the presence of many healthcare
    facilities, these all seem to be inadequate due to various reasons including the
    overburden of the dense population and the mismanagement of the available resources
    [[1](#CR1)–[6](#CR6)].

- en: Thus, all these have led to the requirement of the healthcare assistance system
    to provide convenient healthcare to people especially to the elderly people who
    find it difficult for themselves to find and have healthcare assistance. During
    the 1970s onward, the globe witnessed the emergence of modular IT systems in the
    healthcare industry, a period addressed as Healthcare 1.0\. Throughout the next
    decade and a half, healthcare systems at diversified platforms started getting
    networked with integrated EHRs and clinical imaging, giving doctors an optimized
    perspective for diagnosis; this era was addressed as Healthcare 2.0\. During 2005
    onward, the world witnessed the development of genomic information and emergence
    of wearables and implantable, integrated with EHRs, termed as Healthcare 3.0\.
    Lately, the advent and coming together of disruptive technologies like AI, augmented
    reality, blockchain, IoT, robotics, etc., coupled with real-time data collection
    for efficient healthcare support systems, gave rise to the era of Healthcare 4.0\.
    Focus with Healthcare 4.0 was more on collaboration, coherence, and convergence
    for concluding to more predictive, personalized, and informed decision, with anytime
    anywhere access and enhanced analytics. Healthcare 4.0 facilitated accurate differential
    diagnosis and timely medical responses even to remote locations [[7](#CR7)–[11](#CR11)].

    feature of search, contact, compare, evaluate, and select accordingly. This system
    focuses on the convenience for all but aims at providing a little more help to
    the elders for the medical assistance. The chapter is organized as follows: Section
    [2](#Sec2) presents the motivation for taking up the work; Section [3](#Sec3)
    provides the methodology proposed for the work; Section [4](#Sec10) presents the
    implementation details of the proposed work; Section [5](#Sec21) explores about
    the benefit of proposed model, such as enhanced features of security and reduced
    latency; Section [6](#Sec31) discusses about future scope of the healthcare support
    systems for the elderly and work conducted by the authors; and finally the paper
    concludes with optimum choices for design in Sect. [7](#Sec32).'

    developed region was above 60 years in 1950, and the value reached 23% in 2013
    and is expected to reach 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2050\. These numbers will decide
    infrastructural, technological, and financial support challenges. The globe would
    be confronted too. Changes in population demographic will lead to implications
    on healthcare systems, workforce, social systems, and economic systems. Healthcare
    systems for the elderly population would require convenient, flexible, and user-friendly
    solutions in addition to support from medical professionals.

    level across the globe has risen. Even people in remote locations now have access
    to smart technologies. Healthcare is a sector which is expected to have a wide
    reach, even to people in remote areas, and innovations with smart communication
    devices and technology have made this possible. The market is already having a
    number of existent medical services, quite a few online portals are there, and
    these websites and applications assist in providing medical aid to the patients
    through video chats, messaging support with physicians and other professional
    doctors, and online pharmacy support and electronically generated prescription
    services. Whereas some of these services facilitated digitization of hospitals,
    very few provided home-based check-ups and medicine home delivery. One common
    trait seen in most of them was the considerably high consultation and medicinal
    charge mainly because of the services being provided by a small group or organization.
    The proposed system in a way overcomes and minimizes this issue of unaffordable
    medical aid: firstly, because the services are not exclusively provided by a group
    of trained doctors but it rather directs its users to the already practicing doctors
    who charge a nominal amount and secondly, because an automated option for the
    online home delivery of medicines at a minimum possible cost from a number of
    nearby pharmacies would also be provided to the patients [[9](#CR9)–[15](#CR15)].'

    with the user interface while fetching the medical tests needed for a specific
    disease and also displaying the options for the nearest pathologies available.
    This fog layer reduces the latency in getting the data. Based on the last visit
    and the patient’s illness (along with its stage), his/her recovery time is predicted,
    and the relevant precautions and tips are provided on the home screen itself in
    a user-friendly graph format (say, Gantt chart). Moreover, collecting feedback
    after each doctor visit would further improve the search results of the patient
    with the doctors being displayed popularity-wise (doctors having the most number
    of feedbacks displayed first and so on).

- en: The framework proposed offers many benefits as compared to already existing
    solutions; some differentiating characteristics include electronic prescription
    and report generation, personal information of the patient is automatically scanned
    and extracted from the QR code, and no manual entry is needed for it. Entry of
    symptoms, medications and tests are made easy with the help of Auto-Complete suggestions.
    Check-box entries are employed for common frequently occurring names and Apps
    are used for locating directions to nearest medical clinic and pathologies for
    visit, which is potentially one of the major problems faced by the old people
    and patients in general. Due to hassles in finding the doctors through their specialization,
    symptom based medical centers, procedure for automated ordering of medicines and
    easy to use platform for Online transaction, patients often end up skipping their
    medicine dose which might ultimately lead to health complications and late recovery
    of the patients, generally patients do not have the patience, time, and energy
    to run for their medications, therefore easy to use support system is the need
    of hour. The framework proposed automates and eases the process of procuring medicines
    with one push delivery of medicines at home, the framework provides a technique
    for maintaining a huge amount of patient data at one place, and the technique
    also incorporates blockchain for the transfer of medical records and patient details
    to ensure that the process takes place with complete confidentiality and any unauthorized
    intrusion doesn’t take place. Blockchain also maintains synchronous and tamper-proof
    medical record as case studies which may be utilized for research and reference
    purposes. Table [16.1](#Tab1) depicts already available existing mobile-aided

    a doctor for check-up and consultation either online or in person, the medications
    could be ordered online or through any local pharmacy, prescriptions are saved

    have the ease of searching the nearest doctor and pathology on the go but can

    the development of the proposed healthcare system. The system developed was huge
    owing to so many dimensions it had. We started with only a minimal set of requirements,
    and since the visibility of requirements became more clear as the design progressed,
    therefore evolutionary prototype application development model seemed the most
    suitable for the scenario. Similar to the spiral model, work took a start from
    the most important and complex requirements first and then moved on to the less
    important and simple ones. Figure [16.1](#Fig1) depicts the evolutionary prototype

    as and when required by the controller itself. The database handlers and the utilities
    all comprise the model layer of the application. This layer is usually known as
    the data layer. In Android separate classes are created for database handling
    tasks. The view determines the kind of interface that the end users would be interacting
    to. This presentation layer hence deals with the layout files, resources, and
    other UWE components and specifications (here mainly the XML files). As regards
    the kind of look, feel, placement of app components, color, theme, and font size,
    everything is decided in this layer.

    The third layer is the controller which works as the monitor or the mastermind
    of the system. It decides the exact workflow of the application, and how the different
    components would be called and connected is all done at this layer. This layer
    provides the actual business logic for the application, and whenever the user
    interacts with the view, it is the controller that triggers the model in order
    to make any changes to it. In Android, the classes are created separately for
    each task such that the object-oriented paradigms are followed.

    Real-time databases are the popular one and the most widely used. These databases
    are synced with all the clients connected to it. Any changes made by one client

    a key role in making our application user-friendly. Their main usage is within
    the chatbots for interacting with them not like a human computer interaction but
    rather as a human to human interaction. Android applications implement it using
    the STT (speech to text) and TTS (text to speech) engines. The TTS and STT engines
    need to be told beforehand about the language it would be converting. They support
    nearly 14 languages.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Optical character recognition (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion
    of the printed, typed, or handwritten text into a format that could be stored
    and manipulated on a machine. The process of conversion of the text in an image
    to machine-encoded data is done in three steps of filter application (for differentiating
    between the characters and their background), of contour detection for recognizing
    each character separately, and by image classification or pattern matching techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Text recognition was required to be implemented in order to save time for the
    doctors who may not have the time to type each prescription; rather, they can
    simply upload an image of the hardcopy that they produce which would then be converted
    into text and stored on the database or displayed as needed.

    or tests again cannot be entered by the patient from the keyboard every time.
    At this time, text recognition module works wonders, and just by clicking an image
    of the report, the report content is automatically converted into text data format
    and stored without any manual interference.

    Google Cloud Platform. It does all the natural language processing and the other
    difficult tasks on its own and provides the developers with a much refined and
    simplified APWE for integration of chatbot services.

    sample phrases which would all denote the same “intent” or intention of the user
    interacting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second part that is picked is the “Entity” or the object that is being discussed
    or talked about. Sometimes certain “parameters” are also associated with the entities,
    and if proper answer is not obtained, the bot might ask certain follow-up questions
    to clarify that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next come the responses which the bot sends in reply to the user. It does that
    based on the intent of the user. A bot’s response can also be triggered on the
    occurrence of a particular “event.”

- en: (vi) APIsAn APWE (application programming interface) provides a way of gaining
    limited yet useful information which could provide us an answer in yes or no and
    give us an up-to-date correct data for providing it to the user or for authentication
    purposes. The data such obtained can be either directly displayed to the app or
    first processed and then shown to the end users in some other form. The app usually
    interacts by sending a request to the web service, and the web server sends back
    a response in the form of either an XML or mostly a JSON file. This interaction
    is mainly http based, or in the case of web socket connectivity, the response
    is received faster. Figure [16.10](#Fig10) *depicts the usage of an APWE (application
    programming interface).*![../images/501059_1_En_16_Chapter/501059_1_En_16_Fig10_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_16_Chapter/501059_1_En_16_Fig10_HTML.png)

    fastest, and best way of extracting data within a fraction of a second. These
    QR codes can store quite sufficient amount of data including the links, text,
    images, geographical coordinates, etc. unlike the barcodes that were meant for
    storing only a limited data. QR codes provide local small-scale data storage for
    quick retrieval. Nowadays, every smartphone comes with an in-built QR code scanner
    whether it is for making payments or for transferring any file or contacts to
    someone.
  prefs: []

- en: The integration of QR code scanner into an Android app is made easier using
    the Google Mobile Vision API. Using the QR code present on the Aadhaar card of
    the citizens of India, the person’s basic personal information is obtained in
    XML format which is then parsed, and the relevant details are extracted and stored
    to the database and displayed on the UI.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation which was initially used in JavaScript
    for coupling the programs by sending objects to them in this JSON format. Applications
    make use of this format for sending and receiving data from a server or a service
    API. Even Firebase connectivity needs a JSON file (google-services.json) to be
    downloaded and added to the project that needs to be connected.
  prefs: []

    = “Sheetal” ,******“Department” = “IT” ,******}***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to parse the JSON string, a JSONObject class object is created, and
    the received string is passed into it. Then the JSON values are extracted from
    the key-value pairs using the getString(), getLong(), getInt(), etc. methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes this data can also be fetched from the source in the form of an XML
    file (like here in case of QR code scanning). XML stands for Extensible Markup
    Language. In fact, the layouts in Android are created as .xml files. XML is also
    more secure and does not support array for data storage.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The XML files can be parsed by any of the DOM, SAX, and XMLPullParser, but Android
    mainly makes use of the XMLPullParser. Its object is created firstly by creating
    the object of the XMLPullParserFactory and then calling the getPullParser() function
    on it. The values are retrieved based on the attribute names used in the XML file.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Android app or any other software sometimes have a need to store the data being
    processed by that software or app. This processed information or data is stored
    in a database. This database can be on the device itself (SQLite database) or
    on some other device or cloud-based service (Firebase) as well. Firebase is a
    cloud service in which the data is stored and processed in a cloud. It is a no
    SQL, real-time distributed database that is apt for working on some data that
    needs frequent updates and changes. Only its limited access is free, and an Internet
    connection is required for accessing it. Whereas a SQLite database is absolutely
    free, independent, and an open-source relational database that isn’t actually
    present on the Android IDE (Android Studio) but is available on the Android device
    on which the app is being used, SQLite thus does not always require an Internet
    connection and is quite handy to use.

    of a particular fixed dimension; similarly, the sample text to be spoken is also
    converted into its vector representation. These two vectors of voice and text
    are combined and then decoded. This is represented in the form of mel spectrogram.

    is audible and can be played. Figure [16.11](#Fig11) *explains about the working

    data storage and accessibility service. The various stakeholders that are a part
    of the blockchain control the retrieval of records, and only and only they have
    the authority to access the data. The blocks that are linked tend to have a hash
    code derived from its previous block, and that block derives it from its previous
    block and so on. Hence, whenever an intruder or someone unauthorized to the network
    tries to access or make changes to the ledger, the entire chain changes its hash
    code, and the participants get to know. Moreover, the two-way key encryption ensures
    that even if an intruder gains access to the chain, he/she should not be able

    the accessibility of their records in the distributed system by changing the access
    rules for the various participants, for example, allowing a practitioner or researcher
    to access the records only for a fixed period of time. The medical records are
    added as ordered records arranged in a block structure. These blocks are connected
    to each other in a peer to peer network forming a decentralized network. Every
    new block of information is validated by any of the participant nodes with the
    help of a consensus algorithm (proof of work (PoW)) and added only if validated
    successfully. The process is termed as mining, and the node that successfully
    performs the validation is the miner.

    not only the hash of the current block but also the hash of all the blocks following

    a flawless, bug-free, no-wait user experience. This makes it even more important
    to look into the performance, adaptability, and responsiveness of our app. With
    time, the requirements for high-volume workload and data exchanges increase leading
    to decreased tolerance for latency. The problem is seemed to be proportionally
    related to the underlying issue, which was the distance between cloud services,
    users, and value chain partners. However, placing the IT traffic exchange points
    in those dense locations that are in proximity to the customers and third-party
    business partners can significantly reduce the latency caused between the users
    and the cloud services. Minimizing the distance also reduces the latency between
    the interconnected digital consumers (enterprises) and producers (service providers)
    in dense ecosystems of network, cloud, SaaS, and supply chain partners. Similar
    to what high-frequency trading, digital content, and online advertising industries
    do, one can overcome the problem of latency to some extent by placing the applications

- en: In this, we proposed the vision of a deep learning approach with the integration
    of blockchain technology in various applications. The blockchain is a distributed
    database technique that provides immutable, transparent, more secure, and reliable
    decentralized computing services. In [[2](#CR2)–[3](#CR3)], the author presented
    a cost-effective administration, dynamic access, and spectrum services application
    using blockchain for next-generation cellular networks. Some other authors [[63](#CR63)]
    utilize the blockchain technology to increase the performance of the vehicular
    edge networks. They used smart contract blockchain framework design for data sharing
    techniques in vehicular networks. They used proof of work based on mining and
    required huge resources and energy consumption. In [[6](#CR6)], the author discussed
    the mobile edge computing solutions for boosting the communication speed and provided
    seamless communication in heterogeneous networks and device-to-device communication.
    The authors [[8](#CR8)–[10](#CR10)] proposed caching schemes to resolve the backhaul
    congestion problems in mobile edge computing. They also proposed some offloading
    strategies to minimize task duration in the case of heterogeneous networks. There
    is a big challenge for optimizing the computing resources and caching issue on
    the mobile edge servers due to versatility in the time variant, channels, requirements,
    and heterogeneity in emerging 5G cellular networks. Some authors worked on high-performance
    computing algorithms to overcome the demands of upcoming cellular networks.

    in 5G cellular networks, blockchain, IoT, and other emerging technologies. Some
    researchers worked on the integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence
    (AI) in wireless networks to create intelligent networks. AI can be integrated
    with cloud computing, cellular networks, mobile edge computing networks, and IoT
    networks to facilitate intelligent and secure resource management. Reinforcement
    learning is the branch of AI that can be more generic for problem solving approach
    and explicit programming. RL can be processed sequentially and automatically adjust
    the policies by observing the result and behavior. In [[11](#CR11)], the author
    focused on the DRL approach for handling the caching issue in mobile edge computing.
    Further, the author [[12](#CR12)] designed an application to address the expansion
    of the network scale and in-depth feature discovery. The author [[13](#CR13)]
    presented a DL-based algorithm for traffic control and potentially reduced the
    offloading time. Some others worked on a secure and intelligent framework for
    future generation networks integrated with blockchain.

    unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques. Supervised learning is a
    technique where we can estimate and then do prediction based on unknown parameters.
    The existing techniques used for supervised learning are Bayes classifier, vector
    support method, decision tree, random forest, and many more. The unsupervised
    learning is opposite to the previous one; they are used in a heuristic manner.
    In unsupervised learning data is unlabelled and used to train the data. Reinforcement
    learning is a technique that learns from the environment. Q learning is the most
    popularly used deep learning technique. Machine learning is used in several applications:
    load balancing, spectrum sharing, sensor device management, channel utilization,
    energy trading, etc. In [[94](#CR94)], the author presented the machine learning
    models for the data analytics and a threat model. In [[109](#CR109)], the author
    presented the machine learning-based blockchain framework for smart applications

    a sequential learning technique that can adjust to the policies and gives rewards
    accordingly. They mainly focused on the Markov decision process that consists
    of an environment and has a set of agents [[14](#CR14), [15](#CR15)]. Machine
    learning followed through deep learning has basic paradigm learning. The agents
    perform an important role by applying meaning actions. Further, the action gives
    feedback to improve the output action because when the agent interacts with the
    environmental setup, it gets rewards as the feedback signal. The main target is
    to achieve an optimized solution. Recently this approach gained popularity in
    a wide range of applications. The deep reinforcement learning techniques have
    two main categories: model-based and model-free [[16](#CR16)].'

    environment. The environment function helps the agent to predict the probabilities
    and transaction states. The agent can predict better choices by understanding
    the environment. This approach helps plan policy. The author in [[18](#CR18)]
    presented the model-based predictive control, where the agent predicts the environment
    and gives an optimal solution. The agent learns the environment and prepares new
    plans after every interaction in the system. In other [[19](#CR19)] research areas,
    the author used model-based deep learning to train the agent and use agent experience
    to give probable solutions.

- en: In a model-free deep learning approach, the agent learns the ground truth and
    uses different aspects of the environment. This is the best approach as it is
    complex to train the model that can be exploited by agents. Thus, it is more feasible
    and can incubate multiple factors for rewards. The main agenda is to train the
    agent with the best optimal solution. The deep learning approach attracted researchers
    where a large number of possible states can be considered as a feedback output.
    The model-free approaches are deep Q networks, Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic,
    deep deterministic policy gradient, and distributed proximal policy optimization.
    In [[125](#CR125)–[127](#CR127)], the authors used a deep learning approach in
    AI gaming, automatic driving, and robotics. In [[19](#CR19)], the author gave
    DeepMind solutions for Atari video games. Further [[93](#CR93)] worked on actor-centric
    mechanism, where different actors were deployed with different threads of CPU.
    Thus, it improves the training of agents in CPU processing. In [[84](#CR84)],
    the author presented distributed proximal policy optimization. They implemented
    this approach on multi-threading CPU and apply different strategies to train the
    agents. Many other researchers applied the deep learning approach in solving more
    complex problems. In paper [[128](#CR128)], author presented a game based agent
    system, for detecting defeats in the real time multi agent in game environment.
    Some authors in [[49](#CR49)] presented the deep neural network for the diagnosis
    of lung cancer. The deep learning techniques also have a scope in a variety of
    applications. In [[38](#CR38), [39](#CR39)], the author presented the applications
    of deep learning in price prediction and facial sentiment analysis, respectively.
    In [[128](#CR128)–[130](#CR130)], the authors focused on the Markov decision process
    to train the switching policies, routing in networks, tracking control systems,
    and others in [[68](#CR68)] presented the comparison of RL based algorithms for
    application scheduling.The ability of deep learning to work efficiently in high

    technology. All the transactions in blockchain are managed in a tamper-proof ledger.
    It also has a consensus mechanism for attaching a new block to the chain. It offers
    ample of opportunities to manage untruthful parties by decentralized strategies
    of transaction governance. The key features of this technology are decentralization,
    privacy, transparency, auditability, and immutability. Due to its potential in
    various applications, it gained much attention for mobile networks, cloud computing,
    IoT, mobile edge computing, and infrastructure commissioners. Distributed ledger-based
    technology [[24](#CR24)] used distributed databases for organizing hash tree,
    with irreversible and tamper-proof transaction management. Its consensus mechanism
    ensures the integrity of the transaction and guarantees the consistency of the
    transaction. The consensus mechanism performance parameters are transaction throughput,
    security, and scalability that also depend upon application scenarios. PoS, Byzantine
    fault tolerance, and PoW are the commonly used consensus mechanisms.

    the integration with blockchain for 5G cellular networks and IoT networks. Deep
    learning is the machine learning technique based on artificial neural networks
    that have multiple layers between the input and output layers. The deep learning
    network trained the data set based on the environment and performs an action based
    on this. This has huge potential in problem-solving – prediction, categorization,
    resource allocation, classification, speech synthesis, natural language processing,
    etc. The process used in deep learning is to perform feature extraction and then
    do further classification in various layers. It consist of multiple layers; first
    layers works on finding the patterns, second layer works on recognising complex
    problems then further layer deal with the optimization solutions. A large amount
    of data can be arranged and managed using deep learning. As this is a powerful
    technique for high-level feature extraction, it is suitable in blockchain, IoT,
    and 5G networks because it can exploit the large amount of unlabeled data using
    the different deep learning models. Some existing deep learning models are shown
    in Fig. [17.1](#Fig1). Deep Boltzmann network has two layers of neurons, and in
    [[50](#CR50)], the author used this for network communications. They suggest that
    the deep learning reduces the complexity of the complex task. It has great potential
    with technologies like blockchain, 5G networks, SDN, IoT, and cloud applications.
    In deep learning, the agents learn by themselves and experience the solutions
    by maximizing the effort in generating long-term rewards. Its major disadvantage
    is the large set of data needed to train and test before use in any application.
    In [[51](#CR51), [52](#CR52)], the authors presented the applications of deep
    neural networks in various domains. The author in [[53](#CR53)] presented the

    blockchain, and consortium blockchain. Table [17.3](#Tab3) showed the blockchain
    services in future generation communication networks. A public blockchain is a
    conventional approach that allows everyone to participate. The summarised architectural
    view shown in Fig. [17.2](#Fig2) provides the integration of Blockchain, IoT,
    5G networks and deep learning techniques. Private blockchain is acquired by some
    peculiar conglomerate, and the consortium-based blockchain used permission nodes
    to create new blocks. Generally, blockchain has three components – transactions,
    block records, and a consensus algorithm. When a transaction occurred, it is encrypted
    and signed digitally. The block is packed with a cryptographically tamper-proof
    node block. The consensus algorithm helps invalidate the block in terms of consistency
    and order. In the future generation, communication network security is a big issue.
    So the application of blockchain is considered for secure and privacy-preserving
    future networks. Blockchain has the potential to improve the 5G cellular network
    services. In this chapter, we summarized the detail of the services offered by
    blockchain for 5G cellular networks. Table [17.3](#Tab3) provides the details
    of the key services of blockchain in 5G cellular networks. The integration of

    issue, where the lakhs of users need to be served and need to be scaled up. The
    blockchain integration with the IoT and 5G cellular future generation networks
    needs to be proceeding with high computational capabilities for handling a large
    amount of data and transactions. In the paper [[124](#CR124)], author addresses
    the scalability problem in maintaining resource lanes for sharing lanes and multiple
    transaction chain that were also maintained in parallel. So scalability needs
    to handle the fast processing of all the transactions in distributed decentralized
    networks. The computational power is limited to the resources available in the
    application domain. So the scalability of transactions is appreciated when the
    growing demand of the user needs independent lanes for transactions. Further,
    the processing of scalability in these technologies is still a challenging task.
    The scalability in hybrid blockchain, IoT networks, resource lanes, and the hybrid
    consensus in the emerging technologies is an open challenge. The various ML models
    are trained to address the scalability issue. The improper handling of the scalability
    issue leads to the delay in processing transactions. The present ML and DRL techniques
    are trained with the limited capacity data sets that have significantly difficult-to-handle
    scalability issues. Thus the more diversified algorithms need to be a frame in
    this versatile environment to address the scalability difficulties.

    several consensus protocols like proof of learning, PoW, proof of useful work,
    proof of training quality, and proof of DL were proposed. The validity of the
    assigned work is validated by the validator committee in the blockchain consensus
    protocol. Further, the consensus grouping and consensus block will be sent to
    the validator to reach a consensus after some iteration. Thus the complex computation
    is required to solve these huge hash-based calculations in the blockchain. In
    [[125](#CR125)], the author proposed the proof of DL to validate the blockchain
    transaction and train the data set using the DRL approach. The valid proof of
    the transaction block is created only if the DRL model is produced for the same.
    Further in [[127](#CR127)], the author presented the proof of useful work protocol
    to validate the blockchain cryptocurrency using the DRL deployment model. In this,
    a new block is mined with a trained model and checked its threshold limit. Thus
    proper consensus mechanisms are required to address these growing issues.

    their classification policies change the outcomes. In [[129](#CR129)], the author

    for next-generation wireless networks and secure resource sharing and also presented
    a caching scheme. In this, they explore the deep learning to establish secure
    content caching scheme. In this, they presented blockchain and deep reinforcement
    approach to achieve secure content caching scheme. They illustrate the blockchain
    framework for intelligent resource management in 5G networks. They consider the
    caching process for D2D by blockchain consortium. In 5G networks, content caching
    scheme MBSs are used to collect the transaction records. All local transaction
    records are sent to the nearest MBSs and stored after completing the transaction.
    The DRL technique is used for caching supply and mapping caching resources. The
    mapping of caching resources helps in providing bandwidth management between the
    devices and MBS centers. The blockchain provides a secure transaction by guaranteeing
    the authentication of all the records. All the transaction records are maintained
    in the blocks with blockchain and their cryptographic hash to the previous block.
    The MBS center has access to all transaction records and is able to broadcast
    its audit results. The DRL approach formulated the optimized solution to the content
    caching problem in D2D communication. The DRL approach has three key elements
    – system, action, and reward. The content caching requests and content size can
    be collected by agents that can match the caching pairs and managed resource mapping.
    The state in the DRL consists of the <D, C, B> where D represents the content,
    C represents the caching resource, and B represents the bandwidth of the service
    provider. The action in DRL matches the state space to the action. After that,
    the agent received the reward function based on the station and provides a reward
    function. The DRL frameworks use deep neural network as a primary network and
    utilize the actor to explore the policies and critic network to estimate the network
    performance. Thus the DRL helps in training the networks based on the previous
    experience and uses the current state and maps the appropriate state, action,
    and reward. This DRL approach empowers the resource management and D2D communication
    effectively using secure content caching pairing scheme and maximizing caching
    capabilities. The working model is shown in Fig. [17.4](#Fig4).![../images/501059_1_En_17_Chapter/501059_1_En_17_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_17_Chapter/501059_1_En_17_Fig4_HTML.png)

    networks. We epitomize the deep learning current techniques, deep learning in
    resource management, and advanced approaches in future cellular and IoT networks.
    The amalgamation of deep learning with blockchain emerging technology for future
    applications has a significant effect. In this chapter, we explore the opportunities
    available with the emergence of ML and DRL in blockchain to empower the FCN and
    IoT networks. The work is persuaded by the extensive growth of ML and DRL to future
    intelligent technologies. In this chapter, we presented the comparative study
    of the existing survey in the area of deep learning with blockchain-empowered
    5G and IoT networks. We also provided the background knowledge of machine learning,
    deep learning, blockchain, resource management, IoT, and FCN. Then we provide
    the taxonomy of the resource management services utilizing the machine learning
    and deep learning techniques with blockchain. Here we focused on intelligent resource
    management instead of the traditional approaches. The resource management taxonomy
    in the FCN is summarized in Table [17.3](#Tab3) and provides the existing solution
    with the technology used. The resource concerned is network virtualization, resource
    management, data collection and sharing services, federation learning, and spectrum
    management. The major concern is utilizing the issue focused on machine learning
    and deep learning. Similarly, the resources that emanate in IoT networks are resource
    allocation in vehicular networks, spectrum sharing, content caching, traffic scheduling,
    QoS, power allocation, inference management, device-to-device communication, cell
    selection, MIMO, NOMA, and traffic mobility patterns. Table [17.4](#Tab4) provides
    the taxonomy for resource management in blockchain-empowered IoT networks. The
    integration of ML and DRL techniques for intelligent resource management for blockchain
    empowered 5G and IoT networks helps in estimating optimised decision for large
    scale versatile and complex networks. The heterogeneity of emerging technology
    needs intelligent scalability and efficient, reliable networks. In the end, we
    conclude the open issues and research challenges in integrating the ML and DRL
    approach with blockchain to empower the 5G future generation networks and IoT
    networks. We categorize the open research challenges wrt technological and general
    issues in Fig. [17.4](#Fig4). We provide detailed future research challenges in
    blockchain, IoT networks, 5G networks, and utilizing machine learning and deep
    learning. This study concludes the prospective of ML and DRL techniques in blockchain
    empower large scale fully heterogeneous 5G and IoT networks. We also discuss the
    case of using blockchain and deep learning approach for content caching in resource
    management in 5G networks. Finally, blockchain can be accepted in the empowerment
    of blockchain-enabled 5G and IoT network services. The availability of blockchain
    uplifts the shape and future of emerging technologies. This chapter will be helpful
    for those who study the resource management services in 5G and IoT blockchain-empowered

    there were visions of machines communicating with each other since the early 1800s.
    IoT, as a concept, wasn’t named formally till 1999\. By 2013, it had developed
    right into a device using more than one technology, starting from the Internet
    to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems to embedded
    systems. The conventional fields of automation (together with the automation of
    city, building, and homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, manipulate systems,
    and others all support the IoT [[12](#CR12)]. 5G technology is expected to change
    the future of technology; from augmented reality and autonomous vehicles to smart
    cities and distant surgery, the ability for 5G uses is sort of unfathomable. Verizon
    led the manner in growing and deploying 5G and accelerating 5G innovation [[13](#CR13)].
    It may even effectively connect billions of low-complexity IoT gadgets, which
    include environmental sensors and utility meters. These IoT devices are commonly
    delay-tolerant with a focus on being low-complexity and energy-efficient. To deal
    with this IoT segment, 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) keeps conforming
    to NB-IoT (200 kHz bandwidth) and eMTC (1.4 MHz bandwidth) to bring extra abilities
    and efficiencies. 3GPP Release 16 added support for these technologies to perform
    with a 5G core network and in-band with 5G NR deployments – making NB-IoT (Narrowband
    Internet of Things) and eMTC (enhanced Machine-Type Communication) the preliminary
    solutions for 5G large IoT [[14](#CR14)]. This chapter focuses on why these ultra-high-level
    technologies are required and why it is a matter of importance for various industrial
    sectors. It covers various topics such as 5G-enabled IoT with industrial automation
    along with their applications. Every technology has both advantages and disadvantages;

    in some of the places like Pittsburgh, Phoenix, and Boston. A recent accident
    by Uber’s autonomous vehicle raised questions about whether these cars would be
    ready for the roads. Yes, it would be possible, and they can become road-ready
    only with 5G. The fifth-generation wireless data will be the most significant
    data network advancement to date. It is also anticipated to connect nearly everything
    around us with an ultra-fast, completely responsive, and exceedingly reliable
    network. It may also permit us to leverage the whole capacity of superior technology,
    which includes virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things

    vehicles. According to WHO, approximately 1.5 million people die each year due
    to road traffic crashes; in this case, the autonomous vehicle can work as an advantage
    by increasing safety on the roads. Autonomous vehicles could probably lower the
    number of casualties because the software program utilized in them is in all likelihood
    to make fewer mistakes in contrast to humans. A lower in the variety of injuries
    may also lessen traffic-associated issues, which is likewise a bonus of autonomous
    vehicles. Another benefit is removing using fatigue and being able to sleep for
    the duration of an overnight journey. It can also help those who cannot drive
    due to certain factors like age and disabilities (if any) for them to use automated
    cars as a more convenient transport system.

    Implementation of smart cities is considered as one of the high-priority application
    domains for 5G. Smart cities’ operation relies enormously on IoT, and 5G wireless
    networks are a great IoT enabler. A smart city is an urban area connected with
    numerous technologies consisting of the Internet of Things and might improve people’s
    lifestyle. It generally occupies six dimensions: technology, infrastructure, management,
    people, economy, and government. It may sound very complex, but it is possible;
    there are many sensors and connected devices which allow cities to manage and
    monitor infrastructure, financial systems and transport, postal service, and many
    more. Life cycles will be changed once these systems will be implemented. There
    would be several benefits, which include transportation, healthcare services,
    and smart homes. As discussed, autonomous vehicles, apart from that, would be
    an effective traffic management system. As 5G gives high-pace connections among
    devices, it might be great for home automation too. One of the most crucial applications
    and advantages of the 5G effect on smart cities is the betterment of a metropolis’
    healthcare and security structures. Remote monitoring or home caring systems can
    be used to decrease hospitalization rates. There are more advantages, including
    social and economic ones, in implementing the concept of a smart city with 5G
    wireless technology; they are economic growth, better quality of life, better
    environment, excessive job market, safe environment, and better communication

    of soil and nutrition level, predict the weather, monitor livestock maturity,
    and generate lots of data, and this can be used to predict susceptibility to crop
    diseases so that farmers act accordingly. Hence farmers who adopt smart agriculture

    highly hazardous to nature as well as human health. However, those facts are mostly
    invalid and void. They will be briefly discussed in this section. However, we
    do not state that this technology comes with absolutely no faults or disadvantages.
    There exist some disadvantages currently, but they may be resolved in the future.
    Firstly, talking about the existing disadvantages, they can be summarized in the
    following two points.

    as more and more devices are coming online, and thus, 5G plans to use the shorter
    wavelength bandwidth of 30–300 GHz. However, these high-frequency waves tend to
    have very low piercing power and, therefore, get absorbed quickly in the surroundings.
    The solution to this is to build smaller network transmitters, in large numbers,
    placed very close to each other around the city. The model is depicted in the
    image below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this demands a whole new infrastructure in the cities. Building a large
    number of smaller cell towers around the city will be very expensive and time-consuming.
    The time expected to change the infrastructures of current cities at such massive
    levels throughout the world can be easily over a decade. Moreover, the longer
    the project, the higher the investments. To add to it, most of the devices we
    currently use, and which can use wireless technologies, would be incompetent to
    5G, and thus, all of them need to be replaced with new ones, hence adding up to
    the already high costs of this technology. Expected 5G infrastructure is shown

    concerns have not yet been resolved. 5G requires a convoluted infrastructure.
    When combined with IoT, it demands a highly complex digital ecosystem. However,
    a complex system results in greater security challenges. The high-speed data transfer
    abilities of 5G can easily be exploited by malicious attackers. The strength of
    5G-enabled IoT can be abused by attackers to pose security threats. There are
    chances that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults will possibly increase,
    as 5G will enhance IoT’s participation in real-time company systems. And IoT is
    developed at the old client/server model, with old reliability mechanisms. 5G
    technology is built upon the extensive use of virtualization. It also uses the
    containerized systems (as it is expected to run on the cloud). This combination
    highly widens the gamut of options that attackers can exploit.

    because 5G will use very-high-frequency carrier waves, with a significant increase
    in the number of network transmitters expected around the cities. Another fact
    that leads to fake rumors in the case of 5G is that the frequency at which it
    will operate is similar to the frequency which microwave ovens use to cook food.
    This has become a cause of discomfort for the end-users as they think that these
    waves will cook up their organs, similar to how microwave ovens cook food inside
    it. However, there is no truth in such statements. A basic understanding of radiation
    is required to make such fears void. Though the frequency range of both the waves
    is similar, a microwave oven gets its ability to cook food from the power output
    it can generate. A modern-day microwave oven can generate power anywhere between
    500 and 1000 watts. This comparatively massive power is what enables the microwaves
    to boil up the water molecules inside food particles. On the other hand, our smartphone
    or other modern-day IoT-enabled devices can barely generate power anywhere near
    1 watt. Thus, the fearful fact about our organs getting cooked up has no validity.

    low latency is almost impossible to achieve with the previous generation of wireless
    technologies, as the average latency of a 4G network is around 50 milliseconds
    and the best it can do is up to 20–30 milliseconds. Thus, the architecture highly
    demands a network with ultra-low latencies. This is where 5G-enabled devices come
    into the picture as even 5G-enhanced mobile broadband can reach latencies as low
    as 4–5 milliseconds and the 5G-URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications)
    systems can achieve latencies as low as 1 millisecond. Hence, the latency requirements

    Mbps, and the peak of the transfer rate possible is 50 Mbps. Therefore, there
    is a call for 5G’s high data transfer speeds. The peak speed of 5G can reach up
    to 20 Gbps, and even the average data transfer speeds can easily reach 100+ Mbps.

- en: Documents exist of various kinds such as financial papers, identification documents,
    historical records, etc. With the advent of digitization, softcopies are replacing
    the hard copies for most purposes. While digital documents have a lot of advantages,
    there are some challenges associated with them as well. The issues are that digital
    documents can easily be modified, forged, altered, and tampered. It becomes difficult
    for individuals and organizations to ascertain the authenticity of digital documents
    [[10](#CR10)]. The main challenges involved in the authentication of digital documents
    arise due to the widespread use of document manipulating tools, the need for intermediaries,
    the opaque authentication process, and the cost involved [[12](#CR12)]. Thus,
    there is a need for a novel approach for authentication and verification of documents.

    the blockchain. Its unique id and public key are encoded in a barcode, and the
    barcode is added to the bottom of the document. The hardcopy is generated. During
    the verification phase, the hardcopy is first scanned and, using the barcode,
    the metadata is obtained from the blockchain. Using optical character recognition,
    the text is generated and its metadata is compared with that stored in the blockchain.

- en: Blockchain, as the name suggests, is a “chain of blocks” based on the peer to
    peer technology. It is an immutable time-series record of data that is not managed
    by a single entity but a cluster of computers. Each block in the blockchain contains
    data related to transactions and linked with others through cryptographic rules
    [[5](#CR5)]. In a blockchain network, every participating entity holds an independent
    copy of the blockchain and updates its copy as per the underlying consensus algorithm
    of the blockchain network. Blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, and the
    technology came into light in 2008 when a paper about Bitcoin was circulated.
    The identity of Santoshi Nakamoto is unknown, and it is speculated that it could
    be a group of people or an individual. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain
    technology. The popularity of Bitcoin led to the widespread use of blockchain
    technology for various purposes. Over the years, different types of blockchain
    networks have emerged and this technology is being used to solve different problems
    across domains due to inherent characteristics of a blockchain network.

    use the client–server model where data stored in centralized databases is owned
    by private entities. This centralized model has several drawbacks. Firstly, because
    the system is centralized, it can be prone to attacks that can lead to the failure
    of the entire system. Secondly, the owner can shut down the system at their will,
    and data could be lost or corrupted permanently. The blockchain network is decentralized,
    and no single entity controls it. All the participating entities on the network
    are on the same hierarchy, it does not have a single point of failure, and also
    it cannot be shut down at the will of an individual. Since the data is replicated
    by each entity in the blockchain network, the risk of data loss or corruption
    is negligible. A 51% attack is needed to take over a blockchain network, and experts
    believe that it is virtually impossible in the present scenario [[21](#CR21)].

    functions. Also, changes in one copy of blockchain will not do any damage because
    all the entities in the blockchain hold a copy of the same. It ensures that once

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are various consensus algorithms that facilitate the coordination of all
    nodes in a blockchain. The most widely used consensus algorithm is Proof of Work
    (PoW) that is implemented by Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this algorithm, each entity
    (node) in the blockchain network preserves a copy of the blockchain network and
    communicates with other nodes to ensure that all the nodes have the same version
    of the transactions data. A new block is created periodically to record the transactions.
    The process of creating new blocks for updating the transactions is termed as
    mining. Mining is an integral part of every blockchain that is based on hash functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since hash functions are one-way functions, all the nodes try to guess the input
    to generate the particular output. The node that first solves this hash function
    adds the new block to the blockchain. Solving this hash function is simply a method
    of hit and trial; due to the complexity of hash functions, it consumes a lot of
    computational power and electricity. The newly mined block broadcasts the updates
    to all the nodes in the blockchain. The other nodes verify the transactions using
    the hash function for verification of newly mined block. Once verified, all the
    nodes update their blockchain by adding information about the new block. A node
    will not be able to add an incorrect block because of the verification by all
    the nodes in the network. To attack the integrity of such a blockchain network,
    one would need more than 50% of the network’s computing power, which is highly
    unlikely in actual blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Figure [19.1](#Fig1)
    shows the working of a blockchain network.![../images/501059_1_En_19_Chapter/501059_1_En_19_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_19_Chapter/501059_1_En_19_Fig1_HTML.png)

    (PoA) [[14](#CR14)]. As per the Proof-of-Stake algorithm, nodes lock a certain
    number of their coins as a stake in the network. The number of locked coins affects
    the chances of being selected as the node that adds the new block. The larger
    the stake, more the chances of being selected; however, this is a pseudo-random
    process, so the wealthiest node will not be selected every single time. Proof-of-Authority
    works similarly like Proof-of-Stake, but instead of staking coins, the nodes stake
    their reputation. In this algorithm, there are some nodes that are validators
    and only these validators can add the new blocks. The validators are incentivized
    to add the correct transactions because a negative reputation affects their authority
    in the network. In all the three algorithms, the nodes are incentivized to select
    the correct transactions because incorrect verification causes a loss of resources
    in the case of PoW, loss of coin in the case of PoS, and loss of reputation in
    case of PoA [[1](#CR1)].

    problems associated with document authentication and verification. The key challenges
    in the process of authentication of documents can be overcome by using a decentralized
    public ledger. The inherent characteristics of a blockchain network help in solving
    these problems. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that documents cannot
    be modified once they are written, the decentralization removes the need for an
    intermediary, open-source decentralized apps that ensure transparency, and the
    transaction fees associated with the verification process are minuscule compared
    to hiring a third party. The Ethereum blockchain will be used because of its smooth

    once the hash is generated, it is impossible to find out the original input document
    from the hash, and this ensures privacy. Secondly, the size of the output hash
    is always fixed irrespective of the input size. This gives the flexibility to
    use any size or any kind of document. The hash code size is quite small and can
    be written on the blockchain, while writing the entire document on the blockchain
    is an undesirable and inefficient alternative because of the issues of cost, privacy,
    and speed. SHA-256, a strong and presently an uncompromised algorithm, has been
    used as the hash function. It generates a 256-bit hash code that is a 64-character
    alpha-numeric code. Once the hash code is written on the blockchain, it is immutable
    and stored with a timestamp. Later a document can be verified by comparing its
    hash code with that already stored on the blockchain. Even a tiny change in the
    document, i.e., a change of one pixel or character, will completely change the
    hash code due to the “avalanche effect.” Therefore, no two documents will ever
    have the same hash code. Figures [19.2](#Fig2) and [19.3](#Fig3) show the processes
    of authentication and verification, respectively.![../images/501059_1_En_19_Chapter/501059_1_En_19_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_19_Chapter/501059_1_En_19_Fig2_HTML.png)

    by using access control modifiers of functions in the solidity programming language,
    but any individual will be able to search for a hash code because it is impossible
    to generate the document from the hash code. Algorithm [1](#FPar1) shows how the
    authentication of the documents is to be carried out using the proposed approach

    the smart contract is connected to the JavaScript file using the contract’s address.
    Secondly, a function to calculate document hash is created, which takes a document
    as an input and generates a hash code using the SHA-256 algorithm from the jsSHA
    library. This approach has been adopted because if the conversion happens inside
    the smart contract then the user has to pay the transaction fee for converting
    the document into the hash code. AddDocumentHash and FindDocumentHash functions
    in this file send the hash code to the smart contract. The working of the smart
    contract does not change. So, it can be accessed using a command-line interface.
    A user can now select the file to either add its hash code or find its hash code
    on the blockchain.

- en: Before we can deploy our network on the main net, a smart contract must be deployed
    on Ethereum’s test network. The smart contract was deployed on the Rinkeby test
    network. But before deploying the smart contract on the Rinkeby, the computer
    needs to be a node of the network, i.e., it needs to be connected to the Rinkeby
    network. Therefore, the computer must download all the blockchain data and state
    entries of the network and continue to update the latest data and entries as the
    blockchain is constantly growing. This process is called syncing. Once syncing
    is complete, the computer needs to continue to be connected to the network as
    long as it wants to write to the blockchain. A snapshot of the Rinkeby network
    can be seen in Fig. [19.6](#Fig6). Since the blockchain is continuously growing,
    the size of the data increases, and hence the time required to sync the network
    also increases. In this case, it took nearly 60 h to complete the syncing process.
    About 125 million state entries were processed and 38GB of data was downloaded.
    After completing the syncing process, the smart contract was deployed. Figure
    [19.7](#Fig7) shows the Rinkeby syncing process.![../images/501059_1_En_19_Chapter/501059_1_En_19_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_19_Chapter/501059_1_En_19_Fig6_HTML.png)

    on the Rinkeby blockchain and finding a document on the same. All transactions
    can be searched on the Rinkeby Network. Firstly, a document called “certi1.pdf”
    was used, and its hash was written on the Rinkeby blockchain. The hash value and
    transaction id can be seen. The command-line interface works in the same manner
    as it worked while using the Ganache blockchain. The process to add the document
    may take several seconds because all pending transactions are added into new blocks
    and each new block is added every 15 s in Rinkeby. In Ethereum main net, each
    new block takes 10–20 s to be added. Figure [19.8](#Fig8) shows the document being
    added. Once the new block is generated, all the details related to the transaction
    of adding the document hash such as block number, transaction id, transaction
    fee, timestamp, etc. can be publicly viewed. A document hash on the block can
    be searched on the Rinkeby blockchain. If the document hash was written, its timestamp
    and block number shall be displayed, else a message is displayed that says that
    hash value is not found on the blockchain. Figure [19.9](#Fig9) shows the document

    of these applications need a simple interface to perform the tasks. A web application
    will be helpful for all the stakeholders of the blockchain model for document
    authentication and management. The command-line tool is replaced by a web application
    that can be accessed by other users. HTML-CSS and bootstrap framework is used
    to create the front end. HTTP-Server was used local server. MetaMask extension
    needs to be downloaded so that it can inject a web3 provider in the browser. It
    is available as an extension for Google Chrome. Rinkeby network has to be selected
    as the network for the wallet so that end users can sign the transactions from
    their accounts. Multiple accounts can be set up, and the user can deposit or send
    Ether through this wallet. The javascript file is modified by changing the initialization
    code. Web3 provider is set so that it can check if a compatible extension such
    as MetaMask is installed. The smart contract can now be executed using the web
    browser. If no web3 object is found, the user is alerted through a message. The
    primary reason for connecting the smart contract with a web application is that
    it allows users to access our contract without having to run their computer as
    a node. The user can now access the functions to add and search for hash code
    on the blockchain from the browser using the web application. The transaction
    fee to write the document hash will be charged from the MetaMask wallet. The Ether
    for transactions can be requested from Rinkeby faucet.

    academic degree and transcripts, purchase receipts, etc. Universities provide
    a hard copy of academic transcript to their students at graduation. Later, graduates
    have to carry these hard copies to prove their credentials to employers and other
    universities. A digital document of degree and transcript would be convenient
    for students to share their credentials. However, other entities would be skeptical
    to trust these digital documents as they can be easily modified. In order to verify
    these digital documents, they have to contact the issuing university and wait
    for them to validate the degree. Universities have to spend considerable resources
    for a traditional client–server model to store the digital documents and respond
    to the entities that request verification.

    technology to solve the problems in authentication of documents. This solution
    is cost-effective, scalable, secure, and easy to use. The solution works seamlessly
    on the Rinkeby test network. An individual can digitally share their issued documents
    that may be verified by others through the blockchain platform. This solution
    removes the need for intermediaries and does not rely on a central server, and
    thus the service has virtually zero downtime. The solution has been thoroughly
    tested in both local and actual blockchains. Command-line and graphical user interfaces
    have been developed. The central idea to use document hash codes to authenticate
    and verify documents can be used in different implementations by changing the
    underlying blockchain.

    instead of Rinkeby, it can be deployed on the main net to truly utilize the blockchain
    properties. However, the cost must be taken into consideration as actual Ether
    needs to be purchased for the main net. Secondly, the use of private blockchain
    could be considered if storing the documents is desired and the nature of documents
    is sensitive. A central administrator is required in this case, who controls the
    access and grants the permissions.
