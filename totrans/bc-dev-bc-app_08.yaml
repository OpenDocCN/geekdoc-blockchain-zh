- en: 'IntroductionProgramming is essentially telling a computer what to do, when
    to do it and how to do it. It is giving your computer a series of instructions
    to execute. Programming controls most electronic objects. From computers, to vending
    machines, to cellphones and most importantly, the web.JavaScript has been coined
    the language of the web. This is because most, if not all websites use it to make
    their pages appear more dynamic. It is easy to learn and understand, plus it doesn’t
    cost too much to update and upgrade. A lot of the software that’s used is open
    source. There are also lots of websites with free activities you can use to practice.It
    is a programming language that is rooted in text and it allows web pages to be
    interactive. It provides attractive elements that bring users to web pages. Common
    examples of JavaScript you use everyday are Amazon searchboxes, New York Times
    embedded videos or Twitter feed updates. Making use of JavaScript improves the
    user experience of a website by converting static pages to interactive or animated
    pages. So, in short, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.Most of the time, JavaScript
    is used inside web browsers and on web-based apps. Beyond that, it is used on
    servers, in software and on embedded hardware controls. Some examples of interactive
    features on web pages are: zooming in and out on an image, playing audio and video
    on a web page and showing animations.If you are just starting out and your goal
    is to become a software developer, then you must be well versed in JavaScript.
    It is the most established programming language in the world. Once you are able
    to master it, you will be able to develop front and back-end software. JavaScript
    is omnipresent and is pre-installed in every contemporary web browser, so you
    don’t have to go out of your way to study it.There are many structures within
    JavaScript that developers can use when constructing mobile and web apps. JavaScript
    frameworks are bodies of code libraries that offer pre written code for everyday
    programming tasks and features. One such library is JQuery.At first, JavaScript
    was only used in Browsers to build interactive web pages and it was referred to
    as Toy language by developers. That quickly changed when it started receiving
    a lot of support and getting investment from large companies like Google and Facebook.
    These days you can build full scale mobile apps, Real-time networking apps, Command-Line
    tools and Games.Learn JavaScript QuicklyWhen embarking on your coding journey,
    you may have a constant feeling of having a hard time. Your progress can seem
    slow and it’s easy to want to throw in the towel. Here is what I can recommend
    for you to learn expeditiously:'

    Do not feel the need to study everything equally. The Pareto principle states
    that in certain situations, 80% of the effects result from 20% of the causes.
    So, if you focus on 20% of the content in this book that will bring about 80%
    of the results you desire, you will be able to learn in record time. Key areas
    to focus on are Functions, Variables, Conditional statements, Objects and Arrays.

    new. But, it would serve you better to devote more of your time to practicing.
    When you learn to ride a bike, you have to actively move your limbs in order to
    move forward. The same thing applies when learning JavaScript, you learn faster
    by writing code on your machine. In addition to this, dedicating your time is
    essential. Setting aside an hour to practice and write code at least five times
    a week will greatly improve your knowledge.Challenge yourself, and build an actual
    project with JavaScript, no matter how small. Doing this will just cement everything
    you’ve learned. You will also be able to identify what you might be struggling
    with and apply extra effort in those areas.

    solve those problems will always be useful. It will make you sharp as a programmer
    and allow you to finish projects faster.What Is JQuery ?Many years ago, when programmers
    wanted to change the look and feel of the attributes on their web pages, they
    had to include lots of font tags and color attributes. This made their HTML pages
    become overloaded with code and it was very hard to maintain. This meant that
    all web pages had to be maintained and modified manually. After the invention
    of CSS they were able to change the appearance of websites without having to write
    endless lines of code for each page. When JavaScript came along, programmers began
    writing the JavaScript code into their HTML documents because they weren’t well
    versed on it at the time. Eventually, they applied the CSS theory to JavaScript
    and JavaScript libraries were born. Among all the libraries in existence at the
    time, JQuery stood out and we still use it today.When you google JQuery, all that
    comes up is that it is a JavaScript library, but there is more to it than that.
    It simplifies the scripting of HTML on the client-side. Its main objective is
    to make using JavaScript easier for you. It can also be used to make adding animation
    easier. It basically takes a whole lot of common tasks that need several lines
    of JavaScript to run and attaches them to form a single line of code.What do client-side
    mean and server-side mean?Client-side and server-side are also referred to as
    front end and back end even though they aren’t entirely the same thing. Client
    side is where the application code runs and server-side is where the source code
    is stored.Some of the most well known features of JQuery are:●     HTML manipulation●     DOM
    manipulation●     CSS manipulation●     Effects and Animation●     Ajax●     UtilitiesJQuery
    became popular because there was a demand in the market for a tool to simplify
    the coding experience. JQuery is faster than its counterparts and is constantly
    being extended. It aids in writing User Interface function codes in as few lines
    as possible. It is compatible with all browsers and is up to date with their latest
    features.
