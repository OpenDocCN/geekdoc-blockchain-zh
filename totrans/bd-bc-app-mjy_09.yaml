    “trust as a service,” ranging from a secure ledger to enforcement of smart contracts
    (i.e., guaranteed execution of certain software code) to transparent record keeping.
    Network utility tokens are used by blockchain users to “pay” for such network
    services. Users acquire and spend the tokens because they get value and utility
    from the previously mentioned trust as a service.

    middle to issue orders and give out salaries. The rules and protocols of the blockchain
    network must be maintained and enforced by the community members (i.e., the contributors)
    in exchange for tokens. Contributors run computer hardware and software to support
    blockchain nodes, and they participate in the consensus and governance processes.
    These contributors are known as *miners* (in proof-of-work [PoW] consensus blockchains)
    or *validators* (in proof-of-stake [PoS] consensus blockchains). You can read
    more detailed explanations of PoW and PoS in [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02).

    the consensus protocol. They are also “paid” to perform computation to validate
    the transactions in a block or to execute smart contracts involved in the transactions.
    This transaction fee is typically paid by parties originating the transactions.
    As a blockchain matures, the miners and validators should mostly be compensated
    by fees. This forms a closed loop where people who provide services to maintain
    the network (miners and validators) receive fees in tokens, they sell those tokens
    in exchanges, and people who consume network services (users) buy tokens from
    the exchanges to pay the fees ([Figure 22.1](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig1)).

    network itself becomes useful, more and more people want to use the services the
    network provides. The fundamental value of a crypto token could therefore be tied
    to the value of the utility provided by its underlying blockchain network (see
    the fat protocol theory discussed in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01)). If lots of
    people are willing to pay to use the network, the crypto tokens will in turn have
    significant value. Next, let’s look at some examples.

    guarantees execution of computer code (known as *smart contracts*). When parties
    enter into a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, both can be assured that
    the contract will execute as the code is written. This level of integrity is provided
    by Ethereum community contributors (miners and validators) who run Ethereum nodes.
    Those community members are paid by the Ethereum crypto token ETH. As more people
    are interested in using the Ethereum blockchain to enforce their own smart contracts,
    the demand and value of the ETH go up.

    as collateral for financial investment. ETH holders are receiving interests, dividends,
    or “rewards” for their ETHs locked in collateral pools. The ETH has become an
    investible asset that can generate returns. As we will see later in this chapter,
    this reduces the velocity of ETH circulation, creating a virtuous cycle for ETH

    to replace corporations as a way to organize production of digital goods and services.
    Besides trust as a service, a much bigger economic opportunity is for community
    members to contribute application services to be sold on the blockchain networks.
    The blockchain aggregates service offerings and conducts buy/sell transactions
    in crypto tokens. The value of the token can be directly mapped to the value of
    the aggregated services provided via the blockchain. Let’s look at the example
    of a hypothetical storage sharing coin (SSC) to illustrate how an application
    utility token might work.

  prefs: []

    consensus.

    This is analogous to valuing a company’s market cap by its stock price. However,

    to balance the increasing network GDP. A primary objective for a public token
    sale is to jump-start the network effect. Once the token sale is complete, it

    by contributing to the network effect in other ways. All these lead to increased
    network GDP and an increased token price for everyone.

    electricity, mining machines, data centers, and real estate. If the BTC price
    goes up in the market, more people will want to join or expand mining operations,
    hence increasing the computing power (hash rate) on the network. The protocol
    is designed so that an increased network hash rate will cause the Bitcoin mining
    algorithm to automatically increase its difficulty, resulting in higher costs
    for miners. The automatic adjustment of mining difficulty creates a negative feedback
    cycle that keeps the mining cost always in sync with the current BTC market price.
    Because of that, there is no free ride in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

    project expands when more people autonomously participate in and make a contribution

    the entertainment business, ICO participations from parties such as singers, actors,
