    Through the incorporation of cryptocurrencies, blockchain applications have built-in

- en: A blockchain is a decentralized network, and there is no corporation in the
    middle to issue orders and give out salaries. The rules and protocols of the blockchain
    network must be maintained and enforced by the community members (i.e., the contributors)
    in exchange for tokens. Contributors run computer hardware and software to support
    blockchain nodes, and they participate in the consensus and governance processes.
    These contributors are known as *miners* (in proof-of-work [PoW] consensus blockchains)
    or *validators* (in proof-of-stake [PoS] consensus blockchains). You can read
    more detailed explanations of PoW and PoS in [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02).

    the consensus protocol. They are also “paid” to perform computation to validate
    the transactions in a block or to execute smart contracts involved in the transactions.
    This transaction fee is typically paid by parties originating the transactions.
    As a blockchain matures, the miners and validators should mostly be compensated
    by fees. This forms a closed loop where people who provide services to maintain
    the network (miners and validators) receive fees in tokens, they sell those tokens
    in exchanges, and people who consume network services (users) buy tokens from
    the exchanges to pay the fees ([Figure 22.1](ch22.xhtml#ch22fig1)).

    network itself becomes useful, more and more people want to use the services the

    the fat protocol theory discussed in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01)). If lots of
    people are willing to pay to use the network, the crypto tokens will in turn have

    as collateral for financial investment. ETH holders are receiving interests, dividends,
    or “rewards” for their ETHs locked in collateral pools. The ETH has become an

    This is analogous to valuing a company’s market cap by its stock price. However,

    goes up in the market, more people will want to join or expand mining operations,
    hence increasing the computing power (hash rate) on the network. The protocol
    is designed so that an increased network hash rate will cause the Bitcoin mining
    algorithm to automatically increase its difficulty, resulting in higher costs
    for miners. The automatic adjustment of mining difficulty creates a negative feedback
    cycle that keeps the mining cost always in sync with the current BTC market price.

    For a new business or a project to be developed, a certain amount of capital is
    typically necessary. Through an ICO, funds are raised, and participants receive
    blockchain-based tokens issued from the project. If the price of the token goes
    up, participants earn a profit. If the IPO is the traditional tool of fundraising
    for a business, the ICO is the new blockchain-based fundraising method.

    token. Tradable crypto tokens will eventually have their values determined by
    the market force of supply and demand. However, at the beginning of a new token,
    it is hard to predict a market price. The ICO allows early market participants
    to come to a consensus about a token’s worth and offers an opportunity for early
    adopters to purchase the token at its consensus price.

    wildly depending on the time, location, and nature of the transaction. It took
    years before there was a consensus on the Bitcoin price at any given time. Bitcoin
    became a real currency for storing and exchanging values after this consensus
    was reached. By June 2019, it was the ninth most valuable currency in the world

    effect. An ICO contributes to the jump-start of the network effect. A blockchain
    project expands when more people autonomously participate in and make a contribution
    to the project. The value of the blockchain project is in the network it creates.
    If the future value of the network is priced and distributed to the participants
    from the beginning, then more people will participate and feel ownership in the
    project. That creates a positive feedback loop to start the network.

    participate in the ICO and who they are. Generally speaking, it is more advantageous
    for participants who are diverse and can directly contribute to the project to
    join the ICO. For instance, if a project is to create a blockchain network for
    the entertainment business, ICO participations from parties such as singers, actors,
    record label companies, album distribution companies, and movie production companies
    will be particularly valuable as they can help grow the network, and hence their
    own token value, after the ICO.

    often fixed (or predetermined at a rate), and it is possible for a single person

    all working to grow the PoS blockchain is therefore a crucial problem. An ICO

    sale and let people buy the tokens. Yet, this could still result in a monopoly
    and corrupt the blockchain if someone is willing to purchase a majority of tokens
    and hold more than 51 percent of the PoS voting power. Such a phenomenon is called
    a *Byzantine attack* or *51 percent attack*. The solution is to hold a public
    token sale (i.e., an ICO) and optimize the rules to include as many public participants
    as possible (i.e., to set individual caps and participation eligibility rules).
    Therefore, for PoS blockchains, three facts could significantly affect the system
    stability.

    For example, most ICO projects have already volunteered to exclude Chinese and
    U.S. residents from their public sales. Of course, that also means the project

    conducted by a nonprofit organization (i.e., foundation) that provides governance
    and custodianship of the network. Because of various legal risks in countries
    around the world, many ICOs select Singapore or Switzerland as the legal location
    for their foundations. However, the work is often done in junction with a for-profit
    company that provides services to the foundation through contracts. It is a complicated
    structure that has to be set up under sound legal guidance. ICO investors are
    encouraged to review the legal setup and investor protection provided by the foundation
    that raises funding.

    that the Bitcoin in my account is worth $10,000 U.S. dollar (USD), it means that
    I can exchange it for $10,000 USD right now and take the USD to a bank. Cryptocurrencies
    (tokens) can have values and liquidity only when they are actively traded. As
    discussed in previous chapters, crypto tokens can only be part of the blockchain
    incentive design to facilitate network effects when they have established and
    well-accepted value among the community members. In this chapter, we explore the
    services offered by today’s cryptocurrency exchanges. I will discuss different

    currencies. They must be licensed by governments to do business with banks so
    that you can send and receive fiat currencies through your bank accounts or bank-issued
    credit cards. Those exchanges are subject to strict government regulations and
    typically allow only a handful of well-known cryptocurrencies (such as BTC and
    ETH) to be exchanged directly into fiat currencies.

    as they are regulated by the government as semi-financial institutions. However,
    they are also the most restrictive and centralized. For example, they need to
    verify and record every user’s detailed personal information for anti-money-laundry
    and tax purposes. While convenient, their existence does not fit the decentralized
    world view of blockchain cryptocurrencies, and because of that, many consider
    those fiat currency exchanges only an immediate step toward a truly decentralized
    financial system.

    there is no fiat currency involved in trading, those exchanges are much less regulated
    and hence can grow much faster. This type of exchange represents by far the largest
    trading volumes in the crypto currency world at the time of this writing. However,
    as regulations tighten around those exchanges, their future growth is in question.

    must use real names and pay taxes on their earnings.

    fluctuation without actually converting to fiat currencies. Such asset-backed
    tokens include the USDT, which is supposed to be backed by USD deposits in traditional
    banks at a 1:1 ratio. The legal status of those asset-backed tokens is also murky.

    the company’s equity holders to token holders via discounts and buybacks.

    be traded can be larger than what one actually has. If there is margin trading
