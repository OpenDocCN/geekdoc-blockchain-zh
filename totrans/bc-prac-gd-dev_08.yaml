- en: Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology, which makes it easier
    to create a more cost-efficient network with no central point of control. This
    is in contrast to the world where members of a business ecosystem maintain their
    own ledger o`r` systems of record (SOR). These separate ledgers are continually
    being reconciled with one another in an inefficient, expensive, and often nonstandard
    way. Over time, these separate ledgers have been duplicated many times within
    each member’s datacenters. It has gotten to the point where data governance, testing,
    release management, and in effect the complete software development life cycle
    (SDLC) is always hampered and more or less broken or damaged. It is no wonder
    that these institutions cannot innovate fast enough. It’s like trying to run a
    race while dragging a trailer containing all the clothing you’ve ever owned throughout
    your lifetime!

- en: However, recently the concept of private blockchains has become popular within
    the discussions on blockchain technology, particularly among financial institutions.
    Instead of having a fully decentralized network open to the public with anonymous
    parties, it is possible to create a system where each party is identified and
    granted permissions to change or read the blockchain. These private blockchains
    are also tackling the performance issue because consensus is performed on fewer
    nodes. In fact, it is likely that there will be many blockchain networks with
    each network serving a different set of goals and distinct business applications
    (see [Figure 8-1](ch8.xhtml#ch8fig1)).

    are compromising the central concept of decentralization. But for the purposes
    of this book let’s take a look at the differences between the types or categories
    of blockchain.

    applications: public, consortium, and private.'
  id: totrans-7

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: •   **Public**   Anyone can read or submit transactions (submissions will be
    committed if valid), and anyone can participate in the consensus process. These
    trustless platforms are secured by mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of
    stake, a.k.a. cryptoeconomics. In other words, influence in the consensus process
    is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that entity can bring to
    bear.
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: •   **Consortium**   Consensus is controlled by a preselected set of nodes and
    rules for achieving consensus. The right to read the blockchain can be open to
    the public, or it can also be restricted to a set of known participants—for example,
    10 banks in a consortium that agree to the consensus rule that 7 of 10 banks must
    sign (approve) a block for it to be considered a valid representation of the truth.

    or part of it. Read permissions may be public or restricted to a set of known
    participants.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, there are really two categories, *public* and *private*. The *consortium*
    is a derivative of the private blockchain with multiple identified and permissioned
    members/participants.

    them to revert transactions, modify (fix) balances, etc. This functionality may
    be deemed necessary, although we must say these reasons look more like patches
    to fix defective functionality.
  id: totrans-14

- en: •   The miners (or validators) are identified, defined, and known, so any risk
    of a 51 percent attack from colluding bad actors does not exist or can easily
    be identified and dealt with.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: •   Transactions are less expensive, since they only need to be verified by
    a limited set of trusted (and identified) nodes instead of by every node on the
    public network. There does not have to be any transaction fee. There may still
    be a requirement to run a validator node to participate in the network. This would
    be an expense, but would be less expensive to participants than a transaction
    fee on the public network. The validator node may also provide protection against
    a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

    choose private (or consortium) platforms for their blockchain applications. It
    is also a reason that private blockchains are also known as enterprise blockchains.

    The Chain protocol handles this by defining how assets are issued, transferred,
    and controlled. It allows a single entity (private) or a group of organizations
    (consortium) to operate a network, supports the coexistence of multiple types
    of assets (e.g., currencies, securities, derivatives, gift cards, and loyalty
    points), and has a degree of interoperability with other independent networks.

    This feature supports multiple consensus providers, and each can employ different
    algorithms. This type of distributed ledger has many applications focused around
    commerce, such as finance, trade, and supply chain tracking. Other key features
    are that this is a permissioned network, with access controlled by a doorman (TLS
    certificate provided to each node participant upon successful registration), and
    that all communication between nodes is point-to-point, instead of being sent
    to all nodes in a global broadcast.

    contained in a Merkle directional acyclic graph (MerkleDAG), which ensures that
    the blockchain has not been altered or corrupted. All data transmitted to the
    blockchain is digitally signed and verified before it is written to a block. Authority
    is centralized under this model, and any node on the network that has write permission
    to a blockchain can write transactions to that chain.

    of Ethereum. It is designed to support applications that require identity and
    (high-speed/throughput) performance of private transactions within a permissioned
    group of known participants. One of the design goals of Quorum is to reuse as
    much existing Ethereum technology as possible and to keep in sync with future
    versions of the public Ethereum code base.

    transaction. Quorum is a single shared blockchain and a combination of changes
    to Ethereum along with smart contracts to segment the private data. The Go-Ethereum
    code base changes are to the block proposal and block validation processes. For
    block validation, all nodes validate public transactions, and they also validate
    private transactions that they are party to when executing the contract code associated
    with the transactions.

- en: There are many options for permissioned private blockchains, and the list is
    likely to grow. In many cases, government/industry regulation dictates that private
    control is needed. That being said, the freedom, neutrality, and openness that
    started Bitcoin on the public blockchain are things to keep in mind. The focus
    of decentralizing control and consensus on the public platform is clearly something
    to think about. There is a great deal of chatter and concern around privacy, identity,
    speed, and cost of the public blockchain solutions. It is important to note that
    by creating privately administered smart contracts on public blockchains, or cross-chain
    exchange layers that sit in between public and private blockchains, it is possible
    to deliver some degree of the properties of private blockchains on the public
    platforms. Time will tell if these types of capabilities and properties ever get
    built into the public blockchain.
