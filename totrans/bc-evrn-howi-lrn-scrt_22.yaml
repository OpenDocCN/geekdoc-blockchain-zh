- en: You’re probably familiar with the reality show Shark Tank (also known as Dragons’
    Den). An aspiring entrepreneur pitches his or her idea to a panel of successful
    investors, who try to find weaknesses in the business plan. Then the panelists
    either pass on the offer or invest on the spot.

  zh: 你可能熟悉现实秀《鲨鱼坦克》（也被称为《龙之洞穴》）。一个有抱负的企业家向一个成功的投资者小组展示他的想法，投资者们试图找出商业计划中的弱点。然后，评委们要么拒绝提议，要么当场投资。
- en: The drama is watching the entrepreneurs squirm as the sharks put them through
    their paces. What a perfect idea for blockchain, I thought. We could teach investors
    how to think about new blockchain projects, educating while entertaining. A blockchain
    Shark Tank seemed inevitable.

  zh: 看这些企业家在鲨鱼们的逼迫下挣扎，真是充满了戏剧性。我想，区块链完美的匹配这个点子。我们可以教投资者如何思考新的区块链项目，在娱乐的同时进行教育。一个区块链版《鲨鱼坦克》似乎是不可避免的。
- en: Now here we were, with another sold-out blockchain event at TechLab. We had
    cameras and lights; we had even hired a musician to warm up the crowd. This was
    not just another boring blockchain panel; this was a show! It was coming together,
    people!

  zh: 现在我们在这里，在TechLab又举办了一场售罄的区块链活动。我们准备了摄像机和灯光；甚至还请了一位音乐家来热场。这不仅仅是一场无聊的区块链论坛；这是一场演出！事情正在顺利进行，人们！
- en: “How many ladies in the house?” I asked the crowd, and a chorus of hoots and
    hollers went up. “As you ladies know, blockchain is bro-heavy. That is why we
    need more women to get involved, to make your voices heard. Tonight, you are making
    your voices heard.” Cheers. One woman was wearing a T-shirt that read SATOSHI
    IS FEMALE.

  zh: “在场的女士们有多少位？”我问人群，一阵欢呼声和口哨声响起。“正如你们所知，区块链行业男性占多数。这就是为什么我们需要更多女性参与，让你们的声音被听见。今晚，你们将发出自己的声音。”掌声。一位女士穿着一件印有“SATOSHI
    是女性”的T恤。
- en: “Lot of dudes in blockchain,” I riffed. “Too much testosterone can be dangerous.
    It leads to crazy, risk-taking behaviors, like getting involved with blockchain.”
    Pause for laughs. “We need strong, smart women to bring a different perspective.
    We have three of the strongest and smartest here tonight.

  zh: “区块链行业男性很多，”我即兴发挥。“过多的睾丸激素可能会带来危险。它会导致疯狂、冒险的行为，比如涉足区块链。”暂停一下，等待笑声。“我们需要坚强、聪明的女性带来不同的视角。今晚我们有三位最强、最聪明的女性。
- en: “Ladies and gentlemen—but mostly ladies—please welcome Jessica, Navroop, and
    Diane!” Our musician, recording artist Jodi Heights, played a theme song as the
    judges entered to big applause.

    sting, more applause. We needed spotlights. And a set. And sponsors. These events
    were costing us a fortune.'

- en: The format worked even better than I had imagined. Each entrepreneur had five
    minutes to pitch his idea, and the women would grill him. They were all supersmart
    and savvy, and as I listened to the entrepreneurs wrestle with the sharks, I was
    glad that I was just the host.

- en: 'As a bonus, we handed out Blockchain Investor Scorecards, so the audience could

- en: This experience was invaluable, because it allowed us to see how blockchain
    investors actually thought. What questions did they ask? How did they make decisions?
    The women on our panel modeled the kind of laser drilling that investors should
    do before putting in their hard-earned money.

- en: “Don’t be afraid to ask questions,” I told the crowd. “And please don’t ever
    start by saying, ‘This may be a stupid question.’ It’s never a stupid question.
    You’re just giving away your own power, telling the world you’re stupid. If you
    have the question, someone else does, too. Just ask the question.
