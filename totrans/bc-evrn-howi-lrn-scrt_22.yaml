- en: You’re probably familiar with the reality show Shark Tank (also known as Dragons’
    Den). An aspiring entrepreneur pitches his or her idea to a panel of successful
    investors, who try to find weaknesses in the business plan. Then the panelists
    either pass on the offer or invest on the spot.

- en: The drama is watching the entrepreneurs squirm as the sharks put them through
    their paces. What a perfect idea for blockchain, I thought. We could teach investors
    how to think about new blockchain projects, educating while entertaining. A blockchain
    Shark Tank seemed inevitable.

    cameras and lights; we had even hired a musician to warm up the crowd. This was
    not just another boring blockchain panel; this was a show! It was coming together,
    people!

- en: “How many ladies in the house?” I asked the crowd, and a chorus of hoots and
    hollers went up. “As you ladies know, blockchain is bro-heavy. That is why we
    need more women to get involved, to make your voices heard. Tonight, you are making
    your voices heard.” Cheers. One woman was wearing a T-shirt that read SATOSHI
    IS FEMALE.

    It leads to crazy, risk-taking behaviors, like getting involved with blockchain.”
    Pause for laughs. “We need strong, smart women to bring a different perspective.
    We have three of the strongest and smartest here tonight.

    Diane!” Our musician, recording artist Jodi Heights, played a theme song as the
    judges entered to big applause.

    sting, more applause. We needed spotlights. And a set. And sponsors. These events
    were costing us a fortune.'

- en: The format worked even better than I had imagined. Each entrepreneur had five
    minutes to pitch his idea, and the women would grill him. They were all supersmart
    and savvy, and as I listened to the entrepreneurs wrestle with the sharks, I was
    glad that I was just the host.

    track social media activity around various altcoins. “Then marketing. Then . . .”

    rate each project themselves. After a round of audience questions, we ushered
    each entrepreneur into the Cone of Silence and took a vote: How many people would
    personally invest in this blockchain token?'

    investors actually thought. What questions did they ask? How did they make decisions?
    The women on our panel modeled the kind of laser drilling that investors should
    do before putting in their hard-earned money.

    start by saying, ‘This may be a stupid question.’ It’s never a stupid question.
    You’re just giving away your own power, telling the world you’re stupid. If you
    have the question, someone else does, too. Just ask the question.

    this. “We can claim our power.” I stopped.

    of a cartoon character who runs out over a cliff, then realizes he’s hanging in
    midair. It was a sensation that I would come to know well.

    technology! Blockchain was just the vessel that we were using to bring this message
    out into the world. I looked at the audience to see if they were feeling it. A
    few women were wiping away tears.
