    data to the financial services profession, this also connects to the subtopics
    of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the services that can be constructed
    off of these trends. The trends of blockchain, increased encryption, and the intersection
    of greater technology integration with traditional accounting and financial services
    will, of course, cause disruption within the industry, but will also cause a paradigm
    shift as to how professionals view and evaluate assurance, audit, and other advisory
    services. This is an important topic to keep in mind, especially as different
    technologies and technology tools continue to enter, evolve, and disrupt the marketplace
    over time. Regardless of the specific tool or platform that is utilized as a component
    of this process; RPA, AI, blockchain, or other automation tools or processes,
    the underlying trend is that professional services are going to become increasingly
    connected to the data that is produced, stored, and disseminated by organizations
    both internally and externally. No two firms as the same, and the applications
    and implications of data and information technology will have different end effects
    depending on the specific vector and business model of the practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the specific implications and considerations that should be taken
    into account will differ depending on the size of the firm and the specific clients
    that are involve in the conversation. Different clients and organizations will
    have different interest and end use applications based on the information that
    is produced by the entity, and that is where practitioners can take a forward
    looking and more proactive approach as to how these different sources of information
    can be implemented, integrated, and delivered to both internal colleagues and
    external clients. This realization and shift, that data and information is an
    asset, also connects the idea and concept of the Internet of Things as it applies
    to both accounting and finance professionals. For example, accounting professionals
    can and should have conversations with both current and potential future clients
    about the possibilities embedded in the more effective utilization of organizational
    information. If a manufacturer or inventory based organization is interested in
    improving operational efficiency they might be interested in installing sensors
    and other information gathering products linked to how customers are actually
    using information. A hands on application of this desire and interest might be
    monitoring when consumers are withdrawing products from a smart fridge or cabinet,
    and being able to deliver digital coupons or other information to those customers
    to encourage or motivate certain future purchase behaviors (Fig. [17.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_17_Chapter/467992_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_17_Chapter/467992_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.png)

    this increased transparency and access to information and data can lead directly
    to new lines of business. Client organizations are, in virtually every instance,
    more interested in how advisors and partners can assist them in growing their
    business going forward, and this is exactly where the effective leveraging of
    technology can be of direct assistance and help (Drew [2018](#CR3)). Building
    this bridge, and connecting the dots between operational information and financial
    results lies at the heart of the value proposition now enabled by advancing technology
    tools. No matter what geographic location an organization or practitioner happens
    to be located within the ability to scale and offer services on par with the largest
    multinational organizations is possible. This is a simple sentence to write and
    an even shorter one to read, but it has the potential to have profound implications
    on the structure and nature of the profession going forward. Let’s take a look
    at a few of the ways that the increasing technological integration between different
    emerging tools and platforms can have, both on practitioners and the firms they
    service, including a few innovative solutions and business models that may be
    of interest to practitioners across industry lines. The Figure below highlights
    the potential and opportunities from making better use organizational data and

    different types of practitioners or organizations, and while initially this may
    not seem particularly innovative, represents a new way of thinking for many leaders
    of financial organizations. Traditionally firms were constructed and managed by
    the partners and other senior leaders at the organization, who were in turn compensated
    via a combination of factors, including the book of the business that they had
    brought into the organization. This, in turn, has driven a wave of consolidation,
    mergers, and acquisitions between different types of organizations in order to
    provide clients will an array of specialized service offerings. While there is
    nothing wrong with that, and that trend continues to occur in the field of accounting,
    asset management, and investing advisory services (just to name a few), the reality
    is that technology advancements is rendering such an approach less necessary moving
    forward. Financial advisors, leveraging technology for marketing and practice
    management, as well as taking advantage of passive and index based investing funds,
    can accumulate assets in the millions of dollars, serve as the principal of an
    organization that provides top notch service and advice to clients with a minimal
    staff.

    to providing the essential coverage that organizations so often may not even realize
    they need, these advisors and consultants can – and increasingly are – playing
    a role akin to cybersecurity advisor and expert. Who else is more qualified to
    asses the risks embedded in a particular system or policy construct that individuals
    and firms whose job – literally – it is to perform these functions? Linking together
    automation processes to help reduce manual exposure to and handling of potentially
    sensitive client information in and of itself can result in efficiency gains and
    benefits accretive to the bottom line. In addition to the services that can be
    expanded on in terms of existing client advisory work and cybersecurity risk assessment,
    the proliferation of technology also allows other options to enter the marketplace.

    is indicated and analyzed, is that this greater availability of information –
    as discussed – allows practitioners the ability to compete and do business in
    much broader and more encompassing areas than otherwise would be possible. Between
    the actual information itself, which can be thought of as a raw input resource,
    and the technology tools and platforms that can be brought to bear for analytical
    purposes levels the proverbial playing field (Whittemore et al. [2017](#CR12)).
    No matter if the individual in question is employed at a large organization or
    operating as a sole practitioner, leveling the playing field in terms of competitive
    advantages and service offerings is a disruptive shift that is already being felt
    in some areas of the marketplace.

    of information  between different institutions and individuals have changed and
    evolved over the last several decades. Business intelligence, big data, data analytics,
    and increasingly data science and data scientists seem to share a common thread
    of theme; that data does indeed drive the entire decision making process at virtually
    every organization. While this may have been a relatively well known truth and
    fact for several decades, the advances and improvements in the technology tools
    that form the core of this book increasingly allow financial practitioners to
    turn data based concepts and ideas into reality (Savva and Straub [2018](#CR10)).
    Taking a quick analysis as to how this increasingly data driven – some would say
    data saturated – environment will change and change the role of practitioners.
    Not meant to be all inclusive or exhaustive in any capacity, but rather a brief
    summarization of core changes, the following does seem to be logical to discuss.

    by the availability of information in the business landscape. Clients and customers
    are going to want, and will only continue to expect, forward looking advice and
    guidance as its linked and connected to organizational performance. The true value
    add that is desired by different clients from different backgrounds and industry
    lines is that advisors and professionals that are brought in will be able to help
    with decisions that have not yet happened. It can be predictive analytics, real
    time dashboards, or even just more efficient utilization of existing resources
    and tools, but the purpose and point of these analysis is similar. Data drives
    the decisions made by the senior leadership of the organization, and this is the
    same no matter what specific industry or organization is analyzed. It is true
    that data has traditionally played an important role in how options are evaluated
    and choices are made, but the emerging technologies of artificial intelligence
    and blockchain have the potential to supercharge existing analytical procedures.

    a data platform and storage system that enables more sophisticated and comprehensive
    data analysis via the permanent nature of how this information is stored. Additionally,
    the near real time and continuous nature of how data is distributed and communicated
    between network members allows – potentially – the greater sharing of information.
    Joint ventures, industry relationships, and coordinating with suppliers and other
    partners are increasingly common, but understanding the financial ramifications
    and impacts of these relationships is something that can prove challenging. Particularly
    with blockchain, this transmission and encryption of information, financial services
    professionals can certainly put together reporting frameworks to extract this
    information in a timely manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A rather obvious application of blockchain consulting and applications is to
    allow financial services professionals to improve the controls over the transfer
    of funds between entities. In addition to the use cases for financial institutions
    such as banks, this immutability and continuously updated nature of the information
    transmitted between entities can also deliver value and insights linked to the
    transfer of information in the non-profit sector (Fambrough [2019](#CR4)). Whether
    it is charities, NGOs, sending financial resources internationally is often rife
    with misallocation of resources, funds that go missing, and uncertainty as to
    what percentage of donated or contributed funds actually end up in the hands of
    the appropriate end user and recipients.

    potential for different applications connected to the financial services sector.
    In addition to finding patterns for trading and investment purposes, different
    AI tools can also enable predictive and proactive advisory services to be offered.
    For example, if the data feeds of an organization are connected to an AI tool
    or platform, the financial services professionals can continuously monitor the
    financial health of the organization. Versus only receiving limited amounts of
    information on a periodic basis, such a connection will allow practitioners to
    render real time advice, insights, and commentary (Perols et al. [2017](#CR8)).
    Specifically, and reflecting the importance of social media and other media outlets,
    being able to create a dashboard to track and report the impact of different news
    stories and headlines is definitive use case of AI for business purposes at large.

- en: Different emerging technologies are clearly already having an impact on data
    analysis and reporting, but it is also worth exploring how exactly these tools
    and platforms link up with the needs and expectations of the marketplace. Blockchain,
    for example, has the potential to streamline and improve the speed and efficiency
    with which large amounts of information are processed across organizations. This
    is nothing new, and has already been discussed both in this book and in numerous
    other setting, but let’s now take a look – prior to offering or even preparing
    to offer consulting services, how blockchain and different automation tools can
    change the operational, financial, and reporting aspects of how organizations
    operate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From an operational level, and linking back to an earlier conversation about
    the importance of different professionals becoming more comfortable with working
    together on a continuous basis, one of the most important considerations for professionals
    to keep in mind are the effects that these tools will have on the operations of
    an organization. Management professionals, some of which may or may not be immersed
    in the accounting or financial information, are most likely to be more focused
    on the tangible in-house benefits at first rather than financial implications.
    For example, if an organization is able to simply eliminate some of the internal
    float that often accompanies the transferring of information or funds between
    different parts of the organization that, in and of itself may make the implementation
    of such a technology more realistic. In the case of JPM coin a primary selling
    perspective and point is the reducing reliance on nostro/vostro accounts, or funds
    kept at affiliated institutions on a daily basis to facilitate intercompany transitions.
    Perhaps not as high profile as cryptocurrency trading or speculation, these back
    office benefits and upsides represent just how powerful these tools can be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The true power of emerging technologies, drilling down to the back office emphasis
    that has begun to dominate the implementation conversation, is that these tools
    and platforms can actually make it simpler to gather and report data already produced,
    stored, and analyzed at the firm. Increasing the speed of availability linked
    to data, as well as increasing the security associated with this data are core
    benefits of utilizing a blockchain based platform. Transmitting this data between
    different stakeholders will inevitably occur and represent a potential pain point
    for organizations, and here is an area in which accounting and financial professionals
    can and should play a prominent role. Stacking technologies, again remaining focused
    on the operational and data analysis implications of emerging technology, amplifies
    the real time transmission of data. From a client advisory perspective this means
    that practitioners and advisors are going to have adapt and evolve to meet the
    changing needs and expectations of the marketplace.

    also be opportunities for unethical actors to take advantage of the information
    asymmetry to engage in fraudulent or other types of unethical activity. Blockchain,
    artificial intelligence, and the implementation of cryptocurrencies are no exception
    to this trend. In fact, with the increased speed with which these new technologies
    have moved from the periphery discussion to mainstream market analysis and debate,
    the potential for making decisions based on erroneous information is arguably
    larger than with other technologies. Drilling down, and taking into account the
    reality that accounting and finance professionals are not going to instantly evolved
    into computer programming experts, there are several core concepts and thoughts

    uncovered it the shift and evolution toward the implementation and linkage of
    real world assets to blockchain technology. Smart contracts, stable coins, decentralized
    autonomous organizations, tokens, ICOS, and the cryptocurrency space at large
    have sprung up in parallel to existing market assets. In essence, these different
    applications and developments that have grown out of the bitcoin blockchain ecosystem
    has remained in the virtual world, whereas demand for more sophisticated and comprehensive
    blockchain applications continues to build in terms of real world applications
    and practices (Diaz-Santiago et al. [2016](#CR2)). This, however, is changing,
    and the process by which this is changing is called tokenization. Stated another
    way tokenization is the representation of physical assets such as real estate,
    art work; for financial rights and obligations. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate
    some of the applications and possibilities embedded within tokenization is with
    an example. It is important to note that even this example is real estate focused,
    the underlying purpose and possibility of tokenization will extend to other asset
    classes and business sectors with equal impact.

    selling the property out right (more on that in a minute). Tokenization is, in
    essence, a method by which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital
    token, and in this example let’s say they are converted into 200,000 individual

    ability to run and execute smart contracts, this will enable these tokens to be

    and other fixed asset conversations, the potential impact of this change should
    be relatively evident. Now, let’s circle back to the actual process that has occurred
    as a result of the tokenization of this real world physical asset, and ask several
    pertinent questions.

- en: First, do the token holders and investors actually have legal rights to the
    profits and ownership of the physical asset itself? Remember, and at least as
    of this writing, there is no worldwide regulation (or even nationally consistent
    regulation) as to what exactly different token holders and entitled to in terms
    of physical ownership and rights. So, if the company that created the tokens on
    behalf of the physical owner decided to sell the physical asset, would token holders
    receive any proceeds? At this point it is clear that the technology works, but
    it is less clear as to whether or not the marketplace is prepared to regulate
    and adjudicate potential issues that will arise. Second, and basically an inevitable
    result of the merger of decentralization and financial investments, there is the
    possibility that the ultimate result will be the creation of a more centralized
    clearinghouse, authorizer, or centralized body to approve and resolve these and
    other associated conflicts. At first glance this may seem reasonable enough, but
    when advising clients both now and going forward the following question must be
    asked – if a centralized authority or clearinghouse is the ultimate end state,
    is that really any different from current operations and crowdfunding platforms?

    currently do exist in the marketplace are related to other fractional ownership
    options and practices that tend to revolve around assets like artwork, collectibles
    or all kinds, or fine wine collections. Tokenization may very well offer increased
    transparency and access to virtual ownership of these assets, but financial professionals
    must be able to understand and state with certainty just what those physical rights
    and obligations actually are. While this may mean waiting until some regulatory
    certainty emerges it may also mean that practitioners are going to have to be
    aware of what these terms and technologies mean for business. Drilling down specifically,
    there are several different avenues that should be the focus of advisory services
    and information delivered to clients and customers on behalf of financial professionals.

    for example, these tokenized items are connected to real world securities and
    physical assets, how are the underlying items secured, verified, and valued (Lai
    [2018](#CR6))? If these sound similar to questions raised as they are connected
    to stablecoins that is because they are quite similar; whenever a derivative like
    security or asset is mentioned or introduced to the marketplace, the responsibility
    lies with practitioners to ensure appropriate financial regulations and guidelines
    are followed. An additional consideration is also connected to the liquidity of
    these securities, namely will investors will purchase these digital tokens be
    able to exchange or liquidate these digitally based items as easily as traditional
    securities. Drilling down to the next layer, are the liquidity factors that are,

    are critically important for practitioners seeking to capitalize on the opportunities
    generated via blockchain technology. Bringing to bear a broader perspective, however,
    indicates that additional opportunities and methods for advisory services may
    be emerging; those linked to the higher education institution. Higher education
    and emerging technology may not seem like a thriving market or opportunity for
    financial advisory services connected to emerging technology, but that is missing
    the real picture. With the most recent nationally collected revenues (2016) exceeding
    $550 billion, this is not an insignificant market for advisory services nor one
    that can be ignored by financial practitioners. One of the key challenges, as
    well as a challenge that is often cited by politicians and pundits alike, is that
    cost of higher education has resulted in an educational system that may – almost
    by default – exclude certain individuals or socioeconomic groups. No technology,

    fundamental issues with any specific industry. That said, blockchain has the ability

    over 3000 colleges and universities and for the last decade or so (depending on
    the specific reference cited), the total number of college bound individuals has
    been flat or declining. Introducing new and innovative curriculum and course concepts
    represents a definitive way in which institutions can differentiate themselves
    from the competition. Making this connection, and explaining this reality to different

    While this might seem like a rather obvious ripple effect and impact of blockchain
    adoption, the reality is that the marketplace is currently in the middle of a
    severe mismatch between the skills individuals needs and the skills being taught
    and covered in many higher education curricula. Other industries are certainly
    more traditionally aligned with advisory and consulting engagements, but the importance
    of offering new and expanded services to institutions of higher education represents
    a unique opportunity for a number of reasons. First, accessing this industry group
    and sector of the market provides financial professionals an opportunity to engage
    in new methods. Opposed to traditional consulting or advisory engagements, which
    tended to focus on managing investments for the institution, the integration of
    technology is a new area. Blockchain will have an effect on both back office and
    student facing operations at colleges and universities, and since financial service
    professionals are already – in many cases – tasked with understanding and interpreting
    the impact of blockchain throughout the economy at large, taking advantage of
    the growth of interest in emerging technology is perfectly logical.

    offerings, new and future hires will need to have the skills necessary to succeed

    programs that appeal to the needs of the marketplace often go against traditional
    course offerings and planning processes that are in place within the institution.
    Changing strategy is almost always a difficult conversation, so bringing in external
    expertise and advice can assist in smoothing over the inevitable obstacles and
    challenges facing institutions seeking to pivot in a rapidly changing educational
    and business landscape. This also connects back to the second point indicated
    above; coordinating and collaborating with institutions of higher education. Financial
    services professionals can also add to the development and finalization of different

    ledger system that enables the virtually continuous transmission and storage of
    information between network members, and do so using an almost unbreakable (to

    professionals play in the marketplace. Taking a step back first, before really
    drilling into finance specific applications, appears appropriate. In the current
    marketplace, regardless of which specific function is analyzed, centralized systems
    and institutions tend to dominate the conversation. Regulators, banks, accounting
    firm, lawyers, and other institutional authorities operate as central arbiters
    of data, truth, as well as the verification of different information. Blockchain,

    or even partially decentralized system of conducting business transactions there
    may not be a readily available central authority to resolve conflicts, disputes,
    or even settle unusual transactions. This lack of a central authority or clearinghouse
    is contributing to the increased interest in the private blockchain space, which
    can be thought of as a hybrid between an entirely decentralized blockchain and
    a more traditional network. In such an environment, where confirmations, verifications,

    the monitoring of bills of lading to help determine ownership of assets for insurance
    purposes all will be altered. In the current marketplace leveraging current technologies
    these individual transactions take days, if not longer, to settle and clear between
    the involved counterparties. IBM, in an industry partnership with Maersk, has
    attracted (as of this writing) over 100 different organizations to establish,
    maintain, and utilize a common platform to cut down on the manual processing and
    interpretation that so often accompanies international shipping and transportation.

    impact this will have on shipping and transportation industries in particular,
    it will also have quite a large effect on the general insurance business at large.
    Processing insurance claims, obtaining information from the variety of actors
    involved in the verification, processing, and settling insurance claims and payments
    is a time consuming activity that can result in hardship for negatively impacted
    parties. On top of insurance and financial market implications, the impact on
    banking is difficult to overstate in the sense that a decentralized financial
    system will, taken to its logical conclusion, result in either the transformation

    idea, is a complete departure and different structure than any current financial

    of the internet of things, AI and other automation tools and tactics, it appears
    to be a logical next step to integrate AI and deep learning into existing processes
    and programs (Sullivan [2018](#CR11)). Bots do not, in most cases, actually reference
    physical robots but rather the software and operating programming that drive efficiency
    and automation within the organization. This is an important point to highlight
    and emphasize as the shift toward a technologically integrated accounting function.
    A common misconception and rather worthwhile cause for concern amongst current
