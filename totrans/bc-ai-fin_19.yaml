    data to the financial services profession, this also connects to the subtopics
    of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the services that can be constructed
    off of these trends. The trends of blockchain, increased encryption, and the intersection
    of greater technology integration with traditional accounting and financial services
    will, of course, cause disruption within the industry, but will also cause a paradigm
    shift as to how professionals view and evaluate assurance, audit, and other advisory
    services. This is an important topic to keep in mind, especially as different
    technologies and technology tools continue to enter, evolve, and disrupt the marketplace
    over time. Regardless of the specific tool or platform that is utilized as a component
    of this process; RPA, AI, blockchain, or other automation tools or processes,
    the underlying trend is that professional services are going to become increasingly
    connected to the data that is produced, stored, and disseminated by organizations
    both internally and externally. No two firms as the same, and the applications
    and implications of data and information technology will have different end effects
    depending on the specific vector and business model of the practice.

  zh: 回到最初关于将数据与金融服务行业联系起来的对话和主题介绍，这也与区块链、人工智能和可以构建在这些趋势基础上的服务相联系。区块链、加密程度的增加以及更大范围技术与传统会计和金融服务相交融的趋势当然会在行业内引起混乱，但也会引起对专业人员如何看待和评估保证、审计和其他咨询服务的方式产生范式转变。这是一个重要的主题要记住，尤其是随着不同技术和技术工具继续进入、发展和在市场上长期产生混乱。无论所使用的具体工具或平台是什么；RPA、AI、区块链或其他自动化工具或流程，潜在的趋势是专业服务将越来越与组织内部和外部产生、存储和传播的数据联系在一起。没有两家公司是一样的，数据和信息技术的应用和影响将因实践的具体方向和商业模式不同而产生不同的最终效果。
- en: Additionally, the specific implications and considerations that should be taken
    into account will differ depending on the size of the firm and the specific clients
    that are involve in the conversation. Different clients and organizations will
    have different interest and end use applications based on the information that
    is produced by the entity, and that is where practitioners can take a forward
    looking and more proactive approach as to how these different sources of information
    can be implemented, integrated, and delivered to both internal colleagues and
    external clients. This realization and shift, that data and information is an
    asset, also connects the idea and concept of the Internet of Things as it applies
    to both accounting and finance professionals. For example, accounting professionals
    can and should have conversations with both current and potential future clients
    about the possibilities embedded in the more effective utilization of organizational
    information. If a manufacturer or inventory based organization is interested in
    improving operational efficiency they might be interested in installing sensors
    and other information gathering products linked to how customers are actually
    using information. A hands on application of this desire and interest might be
    monitoring when consumers are withdrawing products from a smart fridge or cabinet,
    and being able to deliver digital coupons or other information to those customers
    to encourage or motivate certain future purchase behaviors (Fig. [17.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_17_Chapter/467992_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_17_Chapter/467992_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.png)

    more interested in how advisors and partners can assist them in growing their
    business going forward, and this is exactly where the effective leveraging of
    technology can be of direct assistance and help (Drew [2018](#CR3)). Building
    this bridge, and connecting the dots between operational information and financial

    at a few of the ways that the increasing technological integration between different
    emerging tools and platforms can have, both on practitioners and the firms they
    service, including a few innovative solutions and business models that may be

- en: First, a joint venture or value network may be an idea that is applicable to
    different types of practitioners or organizations, and while initially this may
    not seem particularly innovative, represents a new way of thinking for many leaders
    of financial organizations. Traditionally firms were constructed and managed by
    the partners and other senior leaders at the organization, who were in turn compensated
    via a combination of factors, including the book of the business that they had
    brought into the organization. This, in turn, has driven a wave of consolidation,
    mergers, and acquisitions between different types of organizations in order to
    provide clients will an array of specialized service offerings. While there is
    nothing wrong with that, and that trend continues to occur in the field of accounting,
    asset management, and investing advisory services (just to name a few), the reality
    is that technology advancements is rendering such an approach less necessary moving
    forward. Financial advisors, leveraging technology for marketing and practice
    management, as well as taking advantage of passive and index based investing funds,
    can accumulate assets in the millions of dollars, serve as the principal of an
    organization that provides top notch service and advice to clients with a minimal

    and the technology tools and platforms that can be brought to bear for analytical
    purposes levels the proverbial playing field (Whittemore et al. [2017](#CR12)).
    No matter if the individual in question is employed at a large organization or

    the importance of different professionals becoming more comfortable with working
    together on a continuous basis, one of the most important considerations for professionals
    to keep in mind are the effects that these tools will have on the operations of
    an organization. Management professionals, some of which may or may not be immersed
    in the accounting or financial information, are most likely to be more focused
    on the tangible in-house benefits at first rather than financial implications.
    For example, if an organization is able to simply eliminate some of the internal
    float that often accompanies the transferring of information or funds between
    different parts of the organization that, in and of itself may make the implementation
    of such a technology more realistic. In the case of JPM coin a primary selling
    perspective and point is the reducing reliance on nostro/vostro accounts, or funds
    kept at affiliated institutions on a daily basis to facilitate intercompany transitions.
    Perhaps not as high profile as cryptocurrency trading or speculation, these back
    office benefits and upsides represent just how powerful these tools can be.

  zh: 从操作层面来看，回到之前关于不同专业人员如何更愿意持续合作的对话，专业人士需要牢记的其中一个最重要的考虑是这些工具会对组织的运作产生什么样的影响。管理专业人士，其中一些可能深入或不深入会计或财务信息，可能更关注的是最初对内部利益的关注，而不是财务影响。例如，如果一家组织能够简单地消除通常伴随着信息或资金在组织内部不同部分之间传输的内部浮动，那么仅仅这一点就可能使这种技术的实施更加现实。在JPM币的案例中，主要的销售角度是减少对枢纽/镜像账户的依赖，或者是在日常基础上在关联机构保留的资金以促进公司间过渡。也许不像加密货币交易或投机那样高调，这些后台的利益和好处代表了这些工具可以有多么强大。
- en: The true power of emerging technologies, drilling down to the back office emphasis
    that has begun to dominate the implementation conversation, is that these tools
    and platforms can actually make it simpler to gather and report data already produced,
    stored, and analyzed at the firm. Increasing the speed of availability linked
    to data, as well as increasing the security associated with this data are core
    benefits of utilizing a blockchain based platform. Transmitting this data between
    different stakeholders will inevitably occur and represent a potential pain point
    for organizations, and here is an area in which accounting and financial professionals
    can and should play a prominent role. Stacking technologies, again remaining focused
    on the operational and data analysis implications of emerging technology, amplifies
    the real time transmission of data. From a client advisory perspective this means
    that practitioners and advisors are going to have adapt and evolve to meet the

    real world assets to blockchain technology. Smart contracts, stable coins, decentralized
    autonomous organizations, tokens, ICOS, and the cryptocurrency space at large

    blockchain applications continues to build in terms of real world applications
    and practices (Diaz-Santiago et al. [2016](#CR2)). This, however, is changing,
    and the process by which this is changing is called tokenization. Stated another
    way tokenization is the representation of physical assets such as real estate,
    art work; for financial rights and obligations. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate
    some of the applications and possibilities embedded within tokenization is with
    an example. It is important to note that even this example is real estate focused,

    $200,000, and the owner is seeking to both monetize some of the ownership they
    have in this asset, and wants to do so in a crowd based manner, i.e. not actually
    selling the property out right (more on that in a minute). Tokenization is, in
    essence, a method by which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital
    token, and in this example let’s say they are converted into 200,000 individual
    tokens. Based on some publicly available platform, like Ethereum, that has the
    ability to run and execute smart contracts, this will enable these tokens to be
    traded, have increases and decreases in value, and do so outside in a manner that
    cannot simply be overwritten or erased via a third party action. Quite different
    from the land and ownership registries that currently dominate the real estate
    and other fixed asset conversations, the potential impact of this change should
    be relatively evident. Now, let’s circle back to the actual process that has occurred

- en: First, do the token holders and investors actually have legal rights to the
    profits and ownership of the physical asset itself? Remember, and at least as
    of this writing, there is no worldwide regulation (or even nationally consistent
    regulation) as to what exactly different token holders and entitled to in terms
    of physical ownership and rights. So, if the company that created the tokens on
    behalf of the physical owner decided to sell the physical asset, would token holders
    receive any proceeds? At this point it is clear that the technology works, but
    it is less clear as to whether or not the marketplace is prepared to regulate
    and adjudicate potential issues that will arise. Second, and basically an inevitable
    result of the merger of decentralization and financial investments, there is the
    possibility that the ultimate result will be the creation of a more centralized
    clearinghouse, authorizer, or centralized body to approve and resolve these and
    other associated conflicts. At first glance this may seem reasonable enough, but
    when advising clients both now and going forward the following question must be
    asked – if a centralized authority or clearinghouse is the ultimate end state,
    is that really any different from current operations and crowdfunding platforms?

    on a continuous basis, and the implications of these changes are continuing to
    change services provided to both internal and external clients. Technology such
    as robotic process automation and artificial intelligence can assist professionals
    in gathering data, but using these tools in a proactive manner to assist with
