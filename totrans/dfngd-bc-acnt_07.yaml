    In this chapter, we briefly discuss some innovative applications and business
    models that have emerged. As cryptoassets became mainstream and much capital started
    flowing, the tax authorities took notice. Hence, there were tax regulations forthcoming
    which have created opportunities for tax service firms to educate and serve taxpayers.
    We discuss these developments in the next section.

    popular. In the automotive industry, particularly in the market of used cars,
    there usually is information asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. This
    leads to a loss of trust and hence a high transaction cost and uncertainty. Blockchain
    applications can provide immutable and comprehensive records, generating trust
    in a “trustless” environment. This and other applications in automotive industry
    are discussed in Section 11.4.

    cryptocurrencies – to pay for goods or to be held as investment. Though these
    types of currencies operate as “real money” they do not have legal tender status
    in any jurisdiction. Hence for tax purposes, cryptocurrency was treated as property
    and generally the tax laws governing the acquisition and disposal of property
    were applicable to cryptocurrencies. The 2019 tax form for individuals in the
    United States (Form 1040) includes a direct question on cryptoassets (see [Fig.
    11.1](#fig1)). New IRS guidance issued in October 2019, includes tax treatment

  zh: 11.3. 加密世界的抵押借贷
- en: Throughout the ages, people all over the world, have occasionally found themselves
    with a common problem – need for fast cash. A common solution to this problem
    emerged from ancient China to ancient Greece – collateralized borrowing. Collateralized
    borrowing, or pawning as it is commonly known, involves temporary exchange of
    any non-monetary asset for cash which is expected to be reversed within a specified
    time. That is, the borrower surrenders something of value to the lender for cash,
    later the borrower regains possession of the item once the loan is repaid. In
    instances when the borrower is unable to pay back their loan, the lender obtains
    ownership of the collateral and can sell the collateral and recover the loan amount
    plus a nominal profit. This mechanism of obtaining short-term cash, without necessarily
    disposing off assets, is not just for the poor. Famously, in the fourteenth century
    King Edward II of England pawned royal family jewels to help finance the war against
    France, and Queen Isabella of Spain is said to have borrowed against her jewelry
    to fund Christopher Columbus’s expedition to the New World.

  zh: 自古以来，世界各地的人们偶尔会发现自己面临同一个问题——急需现金。这个问题的一个常见解决方案源自古代中国，直至古希腊——即抵押借贷。抵押借贷，或 commonly
    known as pawning，指的是任何非货币资产与现金的临时交换，预期在指定时间内可逆转。也就是说，借款人向贷款人交出有价值的物品以换取现金，后来一旦偿还了贷款，借款人便重新获得了该物品的所有权。当借款人无法偿还贷款时，贷款人获得抵押品的所有权，并可以出售抵押品以收回贷款金额加上一定的利润。这种无需
    necessarily disposing off assets 就能获得短期现金的机制，并不仅仅适用于穷人。著名的例子是，英格兰国王爱德华三世在十四世纪时为了资助对抗法国的战争，曾抵押了王室珠宝；西班牙的伊莎贝拉女王据说也曾经以她的珠宝为抵押借款，以资助克里斯托弗·哥伦布远航新大陆。
- en: The concept of collateralized borrowing has been adapted for contemporary needs
    and modern technology. It now impacts most adults in the U.S. Mortgage and auto
    loans are two of the most common form of collateralized borrowing. At the outset,
    the lender remits cash that is used toward the purchase of the house or the car.
    Subsequently, the borrower makes periodic payments, exceeding the interest amount,
    toward paying off the loan. The borrower, in the meanwhile, gains the right of
    use of the asset. If the borrower sells the asset, the lender has the first right
    toward the proceeds from the sale to satisfy any outstanding loan balance. Often,
    the lender holds the title to the property until the loan is paid in full, thereby
    preventing a sale of the collateralized asset without their knowledge. In instances
    when the borrower becomes delinquent or is unable to pay the loan, the lender
    seizes the asset and forecloses on the loan. The lender then sells off the asset
    to recover the unpaid balance.

  zh: 有担保的借款概念已根据当代需求和现代技术进行了调整。现在，它影响了美国大多数成年人。按揭贷款和汽车贷款是有担保借款最常见的形式。起初，贷款人支付现金用于购买房屋或汽车。随后，借款人定期还款，还款额超过利息，用于偿还贷款。与此同时，借款人获得了使用该资产的权利。如果借款人出售资产，贷款人有权首先从出售所得中偿还任何未偿还的贷款余额。通常，贷款人持有财产直到贷款全额还清，从而防止在未经他们同意的情况下出售抵押资产。在借款人逾期还款或无法偿还贷款的情况下，贷款人会没收资产并取消贷款。然后，贷款人出售资产以收回未偿还的余额。
- en: Brokerage firms have adapted collaterailized financing in the investing domain
    by allowing investment on margin. Investment on margin allows an investor to invest
    an amount greater than their liquid assets through obtaining a loan using securities
    in their accounts as collateral. For example, if an individual has $10,000 to
    invest in the market, she buys securities worth $10,000 and uses those securities
    as collateral to borrow an additional amount, say $8,000, which she also invests.
    Thus, with a seed capital of $10,000 the individual can purchase $18,000 of securities.
    Now assume her investment gains 5% over a span of time when the loan has accrued
    1% interest. In her original investment of $10,000 the investor would have made
    a modest $500 (or 5% on their investment), but through margin she nets $820 ($900
    of return less $80 in interest), or 8.2% on their investment of $10,000\. If her
    investment increases in value at a rate exceeding the interest on the loan, she
    earns a higher rate of return than the underlying market. Leverage makes a good
    deal even better. However, when market declines and the investment loses value,
    she suffers larger losses since she still has to make the interest payment. Moreover,
    when the investment loses value the lender may, as a preventive measure to secure
    their loan value, sell some of the investment to reduce the amount of loan outstanding.

  zh: 经纪公司通过允许投资者进行保证金交易，在投资领域采用了有担保的融资方式。保证金交易允许投资者通过使用账户中的证券作为抵押借款，投资超过其流动资产的金额。例如，如果个人有10,000美元用于投资市场，她会购买价值10,000美元的证券，并使用这些证券作为抵押借款额外的金额，比如8,000美元，她也将其用于投资。因此，凭借10,000美元的起始资金，个人可以购买18,000美元的证券。现在假设她的投资在贷款累积1%利息的时间内增长了5%。在她最初的10,000美元投资中，投资者将获得500美元（或投资收益5%），但通过保证金交易，她净赚820美元（900美元的回报减去80美元的利息），或10,000美元投资的8.2%。如果她的投资增值速度超过贷款的利息，她获得的回报率将高于基础市场。杠杆使一笔好交易变得更好。然而，当市场下跌，投资价值减少时，她遭受的损失更大，因为她仍然需要支付利息。此外，当投资价值减少时，为了保护其贷款价值，贷款人可能会出售部分投资以减少未偿还贷款的金额。
- en: Businesses also use collateral in their financing activities. Two traditional
    methods are through factoring of accounts receivables and pledging of inventory.
    Most businesses sell on credit to the customers, generating revenue but not cash
    at the time of sale. Cash is subsequently collected when the money is received
    from the customer. In the meantime, the company has accounts receivables, which
    is a promise of future cash inflow. A fast-growing business often faces cash flow
    problems due to the delay in collecting on the accounts receivables. A business
    in need of immediate cash could approach a lender and borrow cash, selling its
    receivables at a discount to compensate the lender for interest charges as well
    as the risk of non-payment. The lender then collects on the invoices, and remits
    the excess to the business after the principal balance and accrued interest on
    the loan is fully paid off. The benefit of factoring is that the business obtains
    the use of cash without applying or qualifying for a loan, thereby bypassing traditional
    banking channels. Likewise, inventory can be pledged as collateral to obtain a
    commercial loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan conditions, the lender may
    liquidate the inventory to meet the terms of the loan. The lender may also regularly
    and periodically inspect the pledged inventory to ensure that the pledged inventory
    is not obsolete or otherwise diminished in value.

  zh: 企业在融资活动中也会使用抵押品。两种传统方法是通过应收账款保理和库存抵押。大多数企业向客户出售商品时会提供信用，从而在销售时产生收入而非现金。当从客户那里收到钱时，现金随后被收集。与此同时，公司拥有应收账款，这是未来现金流入的承诺。一家快速成长的企业可能由于收款账款的延迟而面临现金流问题。需要立即现金的企业可以向贷款人求助，并以折价出售其应收账款以补偿贷款人的利息费用以及未支付的风险。贷款人在收回应收账单后，将扣除本金和贷款应收利息的余额后，将剩余金额转给企业。保理的好处是，企业可以在不申请或符合贷款条件的情况下使用现金，从而绕过传统的银行渠道。同样，库存可以作为抵押品来获得商业贷款。如果借款人不履行贷款条件，贷款人可能会出售库存以满足贷款条款。贷款人还可能定期检查抵押的库存，以确保抵押的库存没有过时或其他价值减少的情况。
- en: Collateralized loan is popular because it provides benefits to both the lender
    and the borrower. The pledged assets, or collateralized assets, gives lenders
    a level of reassurance should the borrower default. This mitigates the risk for
    the lender, enabling the lender to charge a lower interest rate than they otherwise
    would. For the borrowers, they get the use of cash without having to liquidate
    their asset, thereby maintaining the right to use the asset as well as benefit
    from the potential appreciation of value of the asset. Additionally, it allows
    the borrower to avert the tax consequences that may arise from the sale of the

- en: As the collateralized asset acts as a guarantee toward the loan, a drop in value
    of the asset poses risk for the lender. For example, say a lender grants a $100
    loan based on a collateralized asset with market value of $100\. Suppose the asset,
    pledged as collateral, declines in value to $90, the borrower may simply forgo
    the asset and not repay the loan, with the lender absorbing a $10 loss. To prevent
    against such occurrences, lenders typically require collateral of greater value
    than the loan amount. This is known as “Loan to value ratio,” which typically
    is around 0.8\. In other words, the collateralized asset is 125% (1/0.8) of the
    loan amount. Having a lower loan to value ratio provides greater protection to
    the lender. The higher the volatility of the asset value, the lower the loan to
    value ratio is expected to be.

    The borrowers transfer their cryptoasset to their respective wallet through the
    blockchain. The borrowers have to be assured that the digital assets they are
    transferring will be secured and returned to them once the loan is paid off. The
    third-party securer of the digitized asset, would move the digitized asset offline

    in a “hot wallet” are available for transactions, however, those stored in “cold
    storage” are not. As an independent custodian of digital assets, such organizations
    have to maintain sophisticated internal control system to ensure safe keeping
    of the digital assets in their custody. They do so primarily through authorization
    and segregation of duties. Access to “cold storage” would require multifactor
    authentication and “tiered access controls” restrict access to employees. Collateral
    for each loan is stored separately, in different “cold storage,” access to each

    to transfer additional digital assets to their cold storage wallet to restore
    the loan to value ratio. Upon receipt of a margin call, the borrower could potentially
    pay off all or part of the loan. In instances when the borrower does not respond

- en: Traditional risks of collateralized lending are mitigated in cryptolending.
    As discussed earlier, one of the systemic risks is for lenders to ensure that
    the collateralized asset is secured and the borrower cannot sell or use it as
    a collateral toward another loan. The blockchain, by design, does not allow people
    to “double-spend” or pledge the same asset twice. Once they sent their collateral
    to the “secured wallet” of the lender, they no longer have access to those assets,
    until the loan is paid off. The other prevalent risk that lenders bear is that
    of sudden and permanent decline in value of the collateral. Real-time algorithmic
    monitoring of the collateral value and the requirement of a conservative loan
    to value ratio limits the lender’s exposure to volatile markets. Moreover, geographical
    location and physical monitoring of the collateral is no longer a concern, allowing
    individuals and businesses all over the world access to loans in US $s, without
    having to go through elaborate and time-consuming process of applying for loans
    at institutional banks.

  zh: 在加密贷款中，传统的抵押贷款风险得到了缓解。如前所述，系统风险之一是贷款人需要确保抵押资产的安全，借款人不能出售或将其用作另一笔贷款的抵押。区块链的设计不允许人们“双重支出”或两次抵押同一资产。一旦他们将抵押品发送到贷款人的“安全钱包”，他们就不再有权访问这些资产，直到贷款还清。贷款人承担的另一个普遍风险是抵押品价值的突然和永久性下降。抵押品价值的实时算法监控和对保守的贷款价值比率的的要求限制了贷款人对波动性市场的暴露。此外，抵押品的地理位置和物理监控不再成为担忧，这使得全球各地的个人和企业都能以美元获得贷款，而无需通过复杂的、耗时的过程向金融机构申请贷款。

    insurance products such as crop insurance to farmers, etc. The entire contract
    is transparent, and can be subject to public audit, hence increasing confidence
    and trust in the industry. As with AXA’s experience with Fizzy, perhaps the society
    isn’t ready yet but the potential exists and the concept has been tested.

- en: With increased consumer literacy and their increased demand for socially responsible
    behavior on part of the corporations, establishing the provenance of retail products
    is gaining momentum. For example, when a consumer buys a product that is labeled
    “Made in U.S.A.,” how do they know what percentage of the raw materials were sourced
    in the United States. Similarly, when buying Brazilian coffee, how does the consumer
    know that the coffee beans were indeed grown in Brazil.

- en: Blockchain technology through its ability to enhance traceability, and its property
    of immutability, allows consumers to ascertain the origin of products or that
    of its ingredients. The traceability is achieved by entering every detail and
    process in the manufacturing of the product on a blockchain ledger. Once coded
    into the blockchain, the record of the product is “permanent, chronically ordered
    and available to each actor on the network” (Gupta, 2017). This implies that the
    origin of the product can be traced back to its sources and is permanently stored,
    thus subject to future scrutiny.

    about origin; assurance about authenticity; assurance about custody; and assurance
    about integrity as illustrated in [Fig. 11.3](#fig3). Blockchain technology can

  zh: 消费者对产品的保证需求分为四类：关于原产地的保证；关于真实性的保证；关于货物所有权的保证；以及关于完整性的保证，如图 11.3 所示([Fig. 11.3](#fig3))。区块链技术可以通过提供可追溯性、可验证性、可追踪性、不可变性和可验证性来满足这些保证（Montecchi
    et al., 2019）。
- en: Assurance regarding origin involves identifying whether the product was manufactured
    under ethical and safe environment without employing child labor with ingredients
    that were legally sourced from ethical producers. The country of origin of the
    key ingredients, such as coffee beans or cocoa, could influence consumer opinion
    and intent to purchase. Authenticity assurance is important for brand name products
    and luxury goods. For example, when a consumer purchases a Rolex watch or a Prada
    handbag, they are paying a premium for the brand name and would not like a similar
    product from a fake manufacturer. Luxury brand manufacturers use various types
    of trademarks to certify the products’ authenticity, which are typically costly
    requiring trusted third party. Blockchain technology offers alternatives certifications
    that are secure and transparent without reliance on intermediaries (Tucker & Catalini,
    2018). For expensive products, consumers may demand information on the chain of
    custody through the transportation and storage phases. Assurance on integrity
    entails the product’s meeting customers’ expected level of performance and reliability.
    Blockchain can support this by providing transparency on the supply chain processes,
    which previously was difficult for consumer to access. This is usually important
    in exotic fashion products, which claim to use expensive raw materials, like Mongolian
    cashmere or crocodile leather or hand-woven silk. Providing consumers with a guaranteed
    assurance on the raw material, integrity of processes and assurance on the proper
    chain of custody could all be achieved through blockchain.

  zh: 关于原产地的保证涉及确定产品是否在无需童工、合法从道德生产商那里采购成分的道德和安全环境中制造。关键成分如咖啡豆或可可的原产地可能会影响消费者的意见和购买意愿。对于品牌产品和奢侈品来说，真实性保证非常重要。例如，当消费者购买一块劳力士手表或一个普拉达手袋时，他们是为品牌名称支付高额费用，而不希望购买来自假制造商的类似产品。奢侈品制造商使用各种类型的商标来认证产品的真实性，这通常需要信任的第三方，成本较高。区块链技术提供了安全的替代认证，无需依赖中介（Tucker
    & Catalini, 2018）。对于昂贵产品，消费者可能要求在运输和储存阶段获取货物所有权的信息。关于完整性的保证涉及产品达到客户预期的性能和可靠性水平。区块链可以通过提供供应链过程的透明度来支持这一点，而这对于消费者来说是以前难以获得的。这在声称使用昂贵原料，如蒙古羊绒、鳄鱼皮或手工编织丝绸等异国情调的时尚产品中尤为重要。通过区块链，可以向消费者提供关于原料、流程的完整性以及适当的货物所有权链的保证。

    but not sufficient. The financial commitment from each partner to build and maintain
    the blockchain is mandatory. Most of the processes will have to be automated to

- en: Another area where provenance of the product is valued is in the agricultural
    supply chain. Blockchain technology can provide a mechanism for immutable record
    of the product from its harvesting to the retail store, including time-stamp for
    determination of freshness. Such a system will not only give the consumers trust
    and confidence in the product they buy but also an opportunity to reward the producers
    who employ good agricultural practices to cultivate the product. Potentially,
    this could lead to sustainable farming practices and responsible consumption.
    Barilla, an Italian manufacturer of pasta sauce had teamed up with IBM to tackle
    transparency and traceability of its production cycle. The supply chain starts
    at cultivation, harvest to storage and end at the retail store. For assurance

- en: In addition to provenance, the agriculture industry could benefit from insurance,
    crowd-funding and other similar applications on blockchain. For example, agricultural
    insurance built through smart contracts could link to key weather data provided
    by government satellites and make immediate payout in instances of drought or
    flooding. The process of designing, verifying, implementing and enforcing smart
    contracts for agricultural insurance is in developmental phase with a few pilot
    implementations as evidence of proof-of concept. These pilot programs have been
    implemented in Southeast Asia and the Indian sub-continent. However, despite the
