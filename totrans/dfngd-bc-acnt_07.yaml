    In this chapter, we briefly discuss some innovative applications and business
    models that have emerged. As cryptoassets became mainstream and much capital started
    flowing, the tax authorities took notice. Hence, there were tax regulations forthcoming
    which have created opportunities for tax service firms to educate and serve taxpayers.
    We discuss these developments in the next section.

    popular. In the automotive industry, particularly in the market of used cars,
    there usually is information asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. This
    leads to a loss of trust and hence a high transaction cost and uncertainty. Blockchain
    applications can provide immutable and comprehensive records, generating trust
    in a “trustless” environment. This and other applications in automotive industry
    are discussed in Section 11.4.

    regulators around the world adjusted their tax policies and issued updated guidance
    on the tax treatment of cryptoassets. The complexity and variation in these guidelines
    are creating new business opportunities for accountants and tax experts. While
    the United States and the United Kingdom recently issued more thorough guidelines

    cryptocurrencies – to pay for goods or to be held as investment. Though these
    types of currencies operate as “real money” they do not have legal tender status
    in any jurisdiction. Hence for tax purposes, cryptocurrency was treated as property
    and generally the tax laws governing the acquisition and disposal of property
    were applicable to cryptocurrencies. The 2019 tax form for individuals in the
    United States (Form 1040) includes a direct question on cryptoassets (see [Fig.
    11.1](#fig1)). New IRS guidance issued in October 2019, includes tax treatment
    on “hard forks” and “airdrops.” They illustrate the complexity of the treatment

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the ages, people all over the world, have occasionally found themselves
    with a common problem – need for fast cash. A common solution to this problem
    emerged from ancient China to ancient Greece – collateralized borrowing. Collateralized
    borrowing, or pawning as it is commonly known, involves temporary exchange of
    any non-monetary asset for cash which is expected to be reversed within a specified
    time. That is, the borrower surrenders something of value to the lender for cash,
    later the borrower regains possession of the item once the loan is repaid. In
    instances when the borrower is unable to pay back their loan, the lender obtains
    ownership of the collateral and can sell the collateral and recover the loan amount
    plus a nominal profit. This mechanism of obtaining short-term cash, without necessarily
    disposing off assets, is not just for the poor. Famously, in the fourteenth century
    King Edward II of England pawned royal family jewels to help finance the war against
    France, and Queen Isabella of Spain is said to have borrowed against her jewelry
    to fund Christopher Columbus’s expedition to the New World.

- en: The concept of collateralized borrowing has been adapted for contemporary needs
    and modern technology. It now impacts most adults in the U.S. Mortgage and auto
    loans are two of the most common form of collateralized borrowing. At the outset,
    the lender remits cash that is used toward the purchase of the house or the car.
    Subsequently, the borrower makes periodic payments, exceeding the interest amount,
    toward paying off the loan. The borrower, in the meanwhile, gains the right of
    use of the asset. If the borrower sells the asset, the lender has the first right
    toward the proceeds from the sale to satisfy any outstanding loan balance. Often,
    the lender holds the title to the property until the loan is paid in full, thereby
    preventing a sale of the collateralized asset without their knowledge. In instances
    when the borrower becomes delinquent or is unable to pay the loan, the lender
    seizes the asset and forecloses on the loan. The lender then sells off the asset
    to recover the unpaid balance.

- en: Brokerage firms have adapted collaterailized financing in the investing domain
    by allowing investment on margin. Investment on margin allows an investor to invest
    an amount greater than their liquid assets through obtaining a loan using securities
    in their accounts as collateral. For example, if an individual has $10,000 to
    invest in the market, she buys securities worth $10,000 and uses those securities
    as collateral to borrow an additional amount, say $8,000, which she also invests.
    Thus, with a seed capital of $10,000 the individual can purchase $18,000 of securities.
    Now assume her investment gains 5% over a span of time when the loan has accrued
    1% interest. In her original investment of $10,000 the investor would have made
    a modest $500 (or 5% on their investment), but through margin she nets $820 ($900
    of return less $80 in interest), or 8.2% on their investment of $10,000\. If her
    investment increases in value at a rate exceeding the interest on the loan, she
    earns a higher rate of return than the underlying market. Leverage makes a good
    deal even better. However, when market declines and the investment loses value,
    she suffers larger losses since she still has to make the interest payment. Moreover,
    when the investment loses value the lender may, as a preventive measure to secure
    their loan value, sell some of the investment to reduce the amount of loan outstanding.

- en: Businesses also use collateral in their financing activities. Two traditional
    methods are through factoring of accounts receivables and pledging of inventory.
    Most businesses sell on credit to the customers, generating revenue but not cash
    at the time of sale. Cash is subsequently collected when the money is received
    from the customer. In the meantime, the company has accounts receivables, which
    is a promise of future cash inflow. A fast-growing business often faces cash flow
    problems due to the delay in collecting on the accounts receivables. A business
    in need of immediate cash could approach a lender and borrow cash, selling its
    receivables at a discount to compensate the lender for interest charges as well
    as the risk of non-payment. The lender then collects on the invoices, and remits
    the excess to the business after the principal balance and accrued interest on
    the loan is fully paid off. The benefit of factoring is that the business obtains
    the use of cash without applying or qualifying for a loan, thereby bypassing traditional
    banking channels. Likewise, inventory can be pledged as collateral to obtain a
    commercial loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan conditions, the lender may
    liquidate the inventory to meet the terms of the loan. The lender may also regularly
    and periodically inspect the pledged inventory to ensure that the pledged inventory
    is not obsolete or otherwise diminished in value.

- en: Collateralized loan is popular because it provides benefits to both the lender
    and the borrower. The pledged assets, or collateralized assets, gives lenders
    a level of reassurance should the borrower default. This mitigates the risk for
    the lender, enabling the lender to charge a lower interest rate than they otherwise
    would. For the borrowers, they get the use of cash without having to liquidate
    their asset, thereby maintaining the right to use the asset as well as benefit
    from the potential appreciation of value of the asset. Additionally, it allows
    the borrower to avert the tax consequences that may arise from the sale of the
    asset, such as paying taxes on capital gains.

    of the collateral. These are:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the collateralized asset acts as a guarantee toward the loan, a drop in value
    of the asset poses risk for the lender. For example, say a lender grants a $100
    loan based on a collateralized asset with market value of $100\. Suppose the asset,
    pledged as collateral, declines in value to $90, the borrower may simply forgo
    the asset and not repay the loan, with the lender absorbing a $10 loss. To prevent
    against such occurrences, lenders typically require collateral of greater value
    than the loan amount. This is known as “Loan to value ratio,” which typically
    is around 0.8\. In other words, the collateralized asset is 125% (1/0.8) of the
    loan amount. Having a lower loan to value ratio provides greater protection to
    the lender. The higher the volatility of the asset value, the lower the loan to
    value ratio is expected to be.

    is about 35–50%. Moreover, when the loan to value ratio exceeds 70%, the borrower
    is required to transfer additional collateral, or payoff part of the loan to maintain
    the loan to value ratio under 70%.

- en: At the origination of the loan, the lender requires the borrower to transfer
    digital assets to a secured wallet maintained with a third party. The custodian
    of the collateralized asset generates a unique wallet address for each borrower.
    The borrowers transfer their cryptoasset to their respective wallet through the
    blockchain. The borrowers have to be assured that the digital assets they are
    transferring will be secured and returned to them once the loan is paid off. The
    third-party securer of the digitized asset, would move the digitized asset offline
    into a vaulted storage system, known as “Cold Storage.” Digitized assets stored
    in a “hot wallet” are available for transactions, however, those stored in “cold
    storage” are not. As an independent custodian of digital assets, such organizations
    have to maintain sophisticated internal control system to ensure safe keeping
    of the digital assets in their custody. They do so primarily through authorization
    and segregation of duties. Access to “cold storage” would require multifactor
    authentication and “tiered access controls” restrict access to employees. Collateral
    for each loan is stored separately, in different “cold storage,” access to each
    protected by a unique private key. Moreover, the hardware is geographically dispersed
    as a precaution against physical threat, following best practices of disaster
    recovery protocol.

    the lender continues to monitor real-time value of the collateral. An automated
    alert, or a margin call, is sent to the borrower should the loan to value ratio
    were to exceed 0.7\. On the receipt of the margin call, the borrower is asked
    to transfer additional digital assets to their cold storage wallet to restore
    the loan to value ratio. Upon receipt of a margin call, the borrower could potentially
    pay off all or part of the loan. In instances when the borrower does not respond
    to the margin call, the lender liquidates the collateral to fulfill the borrower’s
    obligation and transfers the remaining collateral back to the borrower.

    management protocols for the lenders were triggered. As the loan to value ratio

    impending margin call and asked to transfer additional collateral or payoff the
    loan. In the experience of one such lending company, most customers chose to add
    additional collateral to rebalance their loan to value ratio. However, some customers,
    anxious of the market turbulence, chose to pay off their loan early.

    the blockchain technology. Digitized assets can easily be transferred to the lender
    and the entire loan transaction could occur in absence of a physical meeting between
    the borrower and the lender. This allows the lender to efficiently reach markets
    which otherwise would be prohibitively costly. Furthermore, it allows the cryptoborrowers
    the flexibility to locate the cheapest source of capital. The transfer, storage,
    regular monitoring and eventual return of the collateral is automated and monitored
    algorithmically. The internal controls around the process are adaptations of traditional
    controls, such as authorization, authentication and segregation of duties, in
    a digitized environment.

    As discussed earlier, one of the systemic risks is for lenders to ensure that
    the collateralized asset is secured and the borrower cannot sell or use it as
    a collateral toward another loan. The blockchain, by design, does not allow people
    to “double-spend” or pledge the same asset twice. Once they sent their collateral
    to the “secured wallet” of the lender, they no longer have access to those assets,
    until the loan is paid off. The other prevalent risk that lenders bear is that
    of sudden and permanent decline in value of the collateral. Real-time algorithmic
    monitoring of the collateral value and the requirement of a conservative loan
    to value ratio limits the lender’s exposure to volatile markets. Moreover, geographical
    location and physical monitoring of the collateral is no longer a concern, allowing
    individuals and businesses all over the world access to loans in US $s, without
    having to go through elaborate and time-consuming process of applying for loans
    at institutional banks.

    process from application of coverage to payout if needed, and every process in
    between. The application harnesses the power of smart contracts, as well as different
    solutions on the blockchain. The App boasted that if a passenger’s flight is delayed
    by 45 minutes or more, the payout can be received immediately upon landing. The
    passenger needed to simply check their email and follow simple instructions to
    get their refund deposited in their bank account. The strategy provides both flexibility
    and scale that enables new types of insurance products. It has the potential to
    increase market for insurance products by reducing, or even eliminating, the long
    wait and uncertainty prevalent with the current method of claim processing.

- en: Axa S.A., a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in Paris and the
    second largest financial services company in the world, had launched a similar
    insurance product named Fizzy. It introduced the product in September 2017 as
    part of a parametric insurance scheme for flight delays. The traditional process
    for such insurance was for travelers to phone their insurance company, file paperwork,
    which would then be corroborated with the airline, before the payment was made
    to the traveler. Conservatively, this process would take a week to a fortnight.
    Fizzy, instead used publicly available flight statistics and smart contracts to
    automatically reimburse travelers should their flight be delayed or canceled,
    usually before the passengers could collect their luggage.

    products and processes. There are no exclusions or uncertainty with the claim
    processing – in case of delay there is always a payment. The passenger doesn’t
    even have to file a claim form. The insurance proceeds are deposited to the passenger’s
    bank account directly upon landing, there are no more trips to the bank to deposit
    a check. There are no manual intervention from the insurance company whatsoever,
    reducing the cost of operations for the insurance company.

    as it did not reach the commercial targets. AXA asserted that there was not sufficient
    market appetite for a blockchain-based consumer product as of that time. However,
    AXA has committed to continue to test similar insurance products and has gained
    valuable experience with building and deploying smart contracts by launching Fizzy.

    can yet be exploited. Smart contracts enables complete automation, including quoting
    of the premium, determining when the claim has to be settled, and auto-payments,
    thus reducing operating costs. Lower costs enable insurance companies to access
    developing economies and low-income businesses thereby increasing their market
    reach. Moreover, with reduced costs, insurance companies could offer low margin
    insurance products such as crop insurance to farmers, etc. The entire contract
    is transparent, and can be subject to public audit, hence increasing confidence
    and trust in the industry. As with AXA’s experience with Fizzy, perhaps the society
    isn’t ready yet but the potential exists and the concept has been tested.

    behavior on part of the corporations, establishing the provenance of retail products
    is gaining momentum. For example, when a consumer buys a product that is labeled
    “Made in U.S.A.,” how do they know what percentage of the raw materials were sourced
    in the United States. Similarly, when buying Brazilian coffee, how does the consumer
    know that the coffee beans were indeed grown in Brazil.

    of immutability, allows consumers to ascertain the origin of products or that
    of its ingredients. The traceability is achieved by entering every detail and
    process in the manufacturing of the product on a blockchain ledger. Once coded
    into the blockchain, the record of the product is “permanent, chronically ordered
    and available to each actor on the network” (Gupta, 2017). This implies that the
    origin of the product can be traced back to its sources and is permanently stored,
    thus subject to future scrutiny.

    about origin; assurance about authenticity; assurance about custody; and assurance
    about integrity as illustrated in [Fig. 11.3](#fig3). Blockchain technology can
    deliver these assurances by providing traceability, certifiability, trackability,
    immutability and verifiability (Montecchi et al., 2019).'

    under ethical and safe environment without employing child labor with ingredients
    that were legally sourced from ethical producers. The country of origin of the
    key ingredients, such as coffee beans or cocoa, could influence consumer opinion
    and intent to purchase. Authenticity assurance is important for brand name products
    and luxury goods. For example, when a consumer purchases a Rolex watch or a Prada
    handbag, they are paying a premium for the brand name and would not like a similar
    product from a fake manufacturer. Luxury brand manufacturers use various types
    of trademarks to certify the products’ authenticity, which are typically costly
    requiring trusted third party. Blockchain technology offers alternatives certifications
    that are secure and transparent without reliance on intermediaries (Tucker & Catalini,
    2018). For expensive products, consumers may demand information on the chain of
    custody through the transportation and storage phases. Assurance on integrity
    entails the product’s meeting customers’ expected level of performance and reliability.
    Blockchain can support this by providing transparency on the supply chain processes,
    which previously was difficult for consumer to access. This is usually important
    in exotic fashion products, which claim to use expensive raw materials, like Mongolian
    cashmere or crocodile leather or hand-woven silk. Providing consumers with a guaranteed
    assurance on the raw material, integrity of processes and assurance on the proper
    chain of custody could all be achieved through blockchain.

    to agree to collaborate and share information. If any of the many parties from
    the alpaca farmer (as in previous example) to the tanner and the deliverer do
    not consent to participate, the solution cannot be implemented. Any break in the
    supply chain would defeat the purpose. Consent from all partners is necessary
    but not sufficient. The financial commitment from each partner to build and maintain
    the blockchain is mandatory. Most of the processes will have to be automated to
    eliminate the possibility of human error. The end customer should be aware and
    interested in accessing the provenance information and be willing to pay a premium
    for it to justify all of the upstream costs incurred.

- en: Another area where provenance of the product is valued is in the agricultural
    supply chain. Blockchain technology can provide a mechanism for immutable record
    of the product from its harvesting to the retail store, including time-stamp for
    determination of freshness. Such a system will not only give the consumers trust
    and confidence in the product they buy but also an opportunity to reward the producers
    who employ good agricultural practices to cultivate the product. Potentially,
    this could lead to sustainable farming practices and responsible consumption.
    Barilla, an Italian manufacturer of pasta sauce had teamed up with IBM to tackle
    transparency and traceability of its production cycle. The supply chain starts
    at cultivation, harvest to storage and end at the retail store. For assurance
    on integrity, it provides detailed quality control information throughout its
    supply chain. Not only does it ensure food safety, but also it increases brand
    reputation.

    crowd-funding and other similar applications on blockchain. For example, agricultural
    insurance built through smart contracts could link to key weather data provided
    by government satellites and make immediate payout in instances of drought or
    flooding. The process of designing, verifying, implementing and enforcing smart
    contracts for agricultural insurance is in developmental phase with a few pilot
    implementations as evidence of proof-of concept. These pilot programs have been
    implemented in Southeast Asia and the Indian sub-continent. However, despite the
    benefits, the rate of adoption of these products in the rural and illiterate communities
    remain low.

    application of blockchain technology. In the impoverished regions of the world,

    registry more reliable. While still at a pilot stage, the social implications
    of the success of this project cannot be overstated.
