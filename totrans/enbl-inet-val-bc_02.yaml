    called proof of work (PoW) (Narayanan et al. [2016](#CR10); Antonopoulos [2017](#CR1)).
    That is, nodes wishing to confirm a block of transactions and receive the related
    reward must solve a cryptographic puzzle requiring computational power. Those
    trying to solve the problem, the so-called *miners*, compete with each other to
    *come first* in proposing the solution, and such competition has currently led
    to massive energy consumption by the Bitcoin community. The central intuition
    behind PoW is conceptually deep, though simple to understand. Nodes willing to
    compete to confirm blocks of transactions must spend resources to do so. In return,
    nodes have a strong incentive to keep the system evolving correctly, limiting
    malicious attacks on the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The incentive would be even stronger if the resources invested in *mining* were
    *sunk* costs, that is, expenditures entirely dedicated to that goal and with no
    utility for other goals. However, such meaningful expenditures are perceived by
    many as waste, as they support high energy consumption to solve puzzles with no
    immediate benefit for society as a whole.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, because of these very high energy requests, as well as problems related
    to scalability and speed (Perez et al. [2020](#CR11)), concerns regarding the
    sustainability of blockchain models based on PoW have emerged in recent years.
    These have led to several alternative DLT models, differing in some elements from
    the blockchain frameworks inspired by Bitcoin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To try solving or mitigating blockchain problems related to energy consumption,
    scalability, security and speed, an alternative class of DLT structures have emerged.
    One such structure is based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG). Latora et al. ([2017](#CR8))
    proposed DAG structures which appear in other contexts, such as citation networks
    (Goldberg et al. [2015](#CR6)) and are thought to represent a possible solution
    to blockchain-related problems. Unlike blockchains, with DAG, data are not stored
    in an ordered sequence of blocks, whereby each of them has limited capacity, but
    rather in a single block/ledger with no pre-specified capacity limit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    IOTA cryptocurrency. IOTA was founded in 2015, aiming to solve some of the problems

    by eliminating the Bitcoin distinction between miners and users. Indeed, each
    node of IOTA’s network *can be both a miner and a user*. There is virtually no
    energy expenditure for approving transactions in IOTA.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In IOTA, the sequence of blocks is replaced by the so-called Tangle (Popov [2018](#CR12)),
    which is the set of transactions executed in IOTA from the start. The term already
    conveys the idea that approved transactions are not organised in blocks. Indeed,
    the underlying structure of the Tangle is minimal and represents the underlying
    nature of the DAG in IOTA. This structure is given by a set of nodes and a set
    of directional links, each of them connecting one node to a pair of nodes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Below, the interpretation of nodes and links in the *Tangle* is discussed.
    In the *Tangle*, each node in the network can be both a miner and a user. Consequently,
    unlike Bitcoin, no significant energy consumption is required to approve transactions.
    More specifically, transaction approval works as follows: except for the initial
    distribution of tokens, any new transaction wishing to join the Tangle, called
    a Tip, needs to approve a pair of transactions which already appear in the ledger.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Therefore, nodes in the *Tangle* represent transactions, whereas direct links
    connecting one node to two nodes represent approvals. However, when a *Tip* approves
    a transaction in the *Tangle*, it does not establish its definite validity. Together
    with other received approvals, it contributes to the validity of that transaction.
    Approving a transaction can be seen as analogous to voting for that transaction:
    the larger the number of obtained approvals, the more probable it is for a transaction
    to be valid and a definite part of the ledger.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As in Bitcoin, transactions have timestamps which describe the temporal evolution
    of the system. In the *Tangle*, however, a transaction timestamp is essential
    to understand the time evolution of the system (perhaps more than for Bitcoin),
    which is not organised in blocks.

    Moreover, transaction approval does not require costly competition across miners.
    This makes IOTA suitable for small currency exchanges which, in Bitcoin, would
    offer low or no transaction fees for confirmation, which may delay or even prevent
    its insertion in a block.

- en: As with other consensus mechanisms, the *Tangle* is not free from malfunctioning
    or malicious attacks. An example of a malfunction is when a *Tip* (a transaction
    in the *Tangle* that has not received approval yet) can remain without approval
    for a long period (even when a Tip contains no double-spending). A double-spending
    attack is also possible. This occurs when a transaction which contains IOTA units
    already spent in other transactions is approved. Strategically, this occurs through
    several small monetary transactions being performed deliberately by the attacker.
    These small transactions are valid and can correctly provide a sufficiently large
    number of acceptable approvals to an invalid transaction.

    blocks enclose confirmed transactions. The original idea (Bentov et al. [2014](#CR2);
    Narayanan et al. [2016](#CR10)) underlying PoS was the following: a user is randomly
    selected by the system, with a probability that is proportional to his wallet
    *coinage*, to confirm the next block. The *coinage* of a currency unit is given
    by the number of blocks for which the unit has been unspent. The *coinage* of
    a wallet is given by the sum of the *coinage* of each unit in the wallet. For
    example, take a user who owns two currency units in his wallet. One has not been
    spent for three blocks and the other for four blocks. In this case, the wallet
    *coinage* is equal to seven. Once a unit is spent and transferred to another wallet,
    its *coinage* becomes zero, until it remains unspent in the new wallet for some
    blocks again.'

    cryptocurrency (Bentov et al. [2014](#CR2)) in a *hybrid* version where PoW was
    also present. Here, mining of a block was still based on solving a cryptographic
    puzzle by means of PoW; however, the difficulty was inversely proportional to
    the user’s wallet *coinage*. Therefore, in this mixed PoW-PoS framework, a lack
    of computational power could be replaced by a high value of coinage, potentially
    saving energy consumption. Such a system can provide an incentive to spend currency
    units with a lower coinage first, and then those with a higher coinage. However,
    this behaviour may lead to infrequent transactions within the community, where
    individuals might be more interested in storing money (to increase the probability
    of getting additional units in the future) than exchanging it. Consequently, the
    blockchain system could end up becoming like a lottery, with currency units playing
    the role of lottery tickets.

    *Coinage* has been eliminated in the PoS version adopted by *Blackcoin* (Vasin
    and Co [2014](#CR14)). Emerging platforms such as Algorand (Chen and Micali [2019](#CR5)),
    as well as more established platforms like Ethereum (Buterin and Griffith [2017](#CR4)),
    are thinking of using PoS as part of their consensus procedures.

    For example, users could be selected to propose a new block of transactions. Alternatively,
    they could be selected to be part of a committee which votes on some specific
    issue. This is PoS because users are randomly drawn with a probability that is
    positively related to the number of currency units they own. More specifically,
    if *A* is the total number of currency units in the system, called *Algo* in Algorand,
    and *a* is the number of units owned by a user, then ![$$p = \frac{a}{A}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png)
    is the probability that such a user would be selected to take a given role.

    Therefore, to prevent frequent re-selection as well as malicious activity against
    committee members, once a user has been chosen, he cannot be re-selected for the
    next few rounds. To discourage opportunistic behaviour and attacks against committee
    members, each member only knows whether or not they have been selected. This is
    possible through verifiable random functions (Micali et al. [1999](#CR9)).

- en: The replacement of PoW with a consensus procedure based on PoS has been discussed
    within the Ethereum community since the start of the platform. The new consensus
    mechanism is called Casper and, like Algorand, it is based on the assumption that
    two-thirds of the users behave honestly. This assumption means that, if less than
    a third of users engage in adversarial behaviour, the system can keep functioning
    correctly. This is the byzantine fault tolerance threshold of the system.

- en: Ethereum’s proposed PoS also contains a feature on how to solve the *nothing
    at stake* issue, which may lead to malicious attacks. This issue could occur under
    PoS because, unlike under PoW, obtaining currency units is not expensive, and
    their duplication is costless. For this reason, the main elements of Casper (the
    final version of which is not complete) have been designed as follows. As in Bitcoin
    and Algorand, validated transactions are stored in a blockchain. However, unlike
    these platforms, to speed up and scale block validation, this is not performed
    block by block but periodically after a predefined number of blocks. Validation
    takes place at blocks called *checkpoints*. Any user with even a minimal amount
    of currency units can be a validator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Validators can obtain some currency units if the block they propose is approved.
    However, to prevent the *nothing at stake* problem, a validator has to deposit
    a certain sum of currency units, which represents their *stake* in the system.
    PoS comes into play here. A validator can then cast a vote on which blocks to
    approve with their stake, over the total number of deposited units in the community.
    If the proposed block violates two specific Casper rules (inserted to avoid forks
    in the chain and double-spending), then the user’s *stake* will be *slashed* and
    lost immediately upon detection of the attack.

    adversarial behaviour. It is interesting to note that, when choosing the size
    of the deposit, a potential attacker faces a trade-off: the larger the stake,
    the higher the probability of approving a specific block (which contains a double-spending
    transaction), but the larger the penalty in the event their dishonest behaviour
    is discovered. Therefore, slashing deposits with Casper can effectively deter
    attacks to the Ethereum blockchain if attackers are detected in time.'

    a user owns 100 *Ether* (the Ethereum currency). Moreover, assume they decide
    to build a deposit with ![$$0 \le d \le 100$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq2.png)
    of them. These *d* Ether are the user’s *stake*. Furthermore, assume the whole
    community deposited a total of 1,000 Ether. When determining how large *d* should
    be, the user can think in terms of the following trade-off. Suppose they propose
    a block that contains a double-spending transaction and whose value corresponds
    to *x* Ether. Now suppose *p* is the probability of the block being detected once
    approved, and *r* is the reward obtained in case of a block approval. Furthermore,
    assume that *D* is the size of the deposit of the users who are expected to vote
    for that particular block. With these assumptions, the user’s utility ![$$U_a(d)$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq3.png),
    in the event they attack, will be a random variable defined by![$$\begin{aligned}

    the value of Eq. [2](#Equ2) increases with *x* and decreases with *D* and *p*.
    Therefore, the value of d given by Eq. [2](#Equ2) is larger than 50, half of the
    available currency units, if![$$\begin{aligned} \frac{(x+r)}{D}&gt;\frac{p}{(1-p)}
    \end{aligned}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ3.png)(3)that
    is if the ratio ![$$\frac{(x+r)}{D}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq5.png)
    is larger than the odds ratio ![$$\frac{p}{(1-p)}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq6.png).
    It is also interesting to observe that expression Eq. [1](#Equ1) clearly shows
    the trade-off faced by a user when choosing the deposit size. Indeed, the term
    ![$$\frac{(100-d) p(d+D)}{1000}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq7.png)
    on the right-hand side of Eq. [1](#Equ1), being quadratic and concave in *d*,
    first increases and then decreases. Intuitively, this means that the utility maximising
    deposit typically should be neither too small nor too large.If, instead, the user
    behaves honestly then his utility ![$$U_h(d)$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq8.png)
    will be equal to![$$\begin{aligned} U_{h}(d)= {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 100+r

    his expected utility will be![$$\begin{aligned} E U_{h}(d)=100+\frac{r(d+D)}{1000}
    \end{aligned}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ4.png)(4)It
    follows that, as Eq. [4](#Equ4) is linear in d, it is maximised by ![$$d_h=100$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq9.png),
    i.e. the entire available sum, hence the maximum size of the deposit. This observation
    is consistent with our intuition. Indeed, if the user is planning not to attack,
    then by depositing his entire available sum, he will maximise the probability
    of being selected to confirm the next block while running no risk of losses.A
    user will consider attacking the system if, when replacing Eq. [2](#Equ2) and
    ![$$d=100$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq10.png),
    respectively, in Eqs. [1](#Equ1) and [4](#Equ4) the former is larger than the
    latter. Note that if ![$$d=100$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq11.png),
    then expression Eq. [1](#Equ1) becomes![$$E U_{a}(d=100)=100+\frac{(x+r)(1-p)(100+D)}{1000}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ9.png)which
    can be larger than Eq. [4](#Equ4) if ![$$\frac{x}{r}&gt;\frac{p}{1-p}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq12.png).

- en: Proof of burn (PoB) is also another consensus protocol worth discussing. PoB
    is currently adopted by cryptocurrencies with limited capitalisation. The first
    and best known of these is Slimcoin ([2014](#CR13)). The goal of PoB is analogous
    to PoS, to propose a consensus procedure solving the energy costs associated with
    PoW while simultaneously reducing the possibility of attacks. Like PoS, PoB is
    a consensus mechanism based on currency units held by users. However, unlike PoS,
    validation of a block and related reward are based on a *burnt* number of currency
    units by a user *b*. Operationally, burning some units means sending them to an
    address which nobody can use. Continuing with the previous example, if a user
    has 100 units in his wallet, then before validating the next block his utility
    level is a random variable defined by![$$\begin{aligned} U(b)= {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    100+r-b &amp;{} \text{ with } \text{ probability } \frac{b}{1000} \\ 100 &amp;{}
    \text{ with } \text{ probability } 1-\frac{b}{1000} \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ10.png)and

    that the optimal ![$$b_o$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq13.png)

    is, the optimal number of currency units to burn is half of the reward obtained
    by the user, in the event they are selected to validate the next block. Inserting
    Eq. [6](#Equ6) into Eq. [5](#Equ5), the expected utility becomes![$$E U\left(
    b_{o}\right) =100+\frac{r^{2}}{4000}$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ11.png)which
    implies that with PoB, the user’s expected utility is larger than 100 and grows
    quadratically with the reward for block validation. If the above analysis is an
    acceptable description of what might happen with PoB, and if r is a relatively
    small reward, then ![$$b_o$$](../images/508554_1_En_4_Chapter/508554_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq14.png)
