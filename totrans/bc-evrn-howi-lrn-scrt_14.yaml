    blockchain, what hope did we have of making it simple enough for everyone to understand?

    our change in direction.

    producers, and developers joining in from their home offices. A dozen little video
    windows, lined up on the screen like satellite feeds. Occasionally a dog would
    bark in the background.

    the greatest technology revolution of our lifetime. But the first time I saw the
    Web, I totally did not get it.”

    the beginning—not just how it worked, but why you’d even need it. Installing a
    Web browser was like genetically engineering a tomato.

    make me a millionaire. “Want to see something cool?” my coworker Ned asked me,
    wheeling his chair over to my desk. This was the same Ned who would be riding
    in the limo with me a few years later.

    up a homemade web page. Two words: “HELLO WORLD!” Plain black text on a dark gray
    background. Ned was breathless with excitement.'

    computer”—he pointed to a black box a few feet away—“that computer over there!”
    He stared at me with a lunatic grin, like he’d discovered time travel.

    of cables, draping across mountain ranges and into oceans, connecting every device
    on earth. Imagine unspooling long cables connected to your mobile phone every
    time you leave the house. Cables! Brilliant!

    with a trumpet and a powdered wig and proclaimed, “One day, twenty years hence,
    you will use this technology to share photos of your food!” Quick trumpet blast.
    “It will allow strangers to buy and deliver your shampoo!”

    Internet startups were the hottest thing on Wall Street. We went from zero to
    crazy in the space of five years.

    billion-dollar unicorns. In fact, some of the world’s most powerful companies—the
    Amazons and Googles of today—were forged in that five-year crucible.

    [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) at the height of the dot-com bubble.”

    apart, we had separate webcams. “Digital currencies, payroll data, frequent-flier
    points, ratings and reviews . . . anything that can be stored and quantified.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My heart sank. They were right. The Web took off only because we had killer
    apps like email and Google. Blockchain had none of this yet. I didn’t doubt the
    technology, but I began to doubt our timing.

    Let’s find the killer apps and tell the world about them.”
