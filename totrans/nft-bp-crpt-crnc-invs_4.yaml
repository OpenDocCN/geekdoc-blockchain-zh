    since 2014\. The wallet is available as a browser add-on for Google Chrome, Firefox,
    Edge and Brave as well as for iOS and Android. In addition to the storage and
    management of tokens based on Ethereum, advanced functions such as staking or
    access to decentralized exchanges (DEX) are also easily possible even for beginners.

    reason why the Meta Mask Wallet is still one of the most popular Ethereum wallets
    in 2021\. With over 1 million users for Android alone, the platform is one of
    the most used Ethereum wallets. Even if hardware wallets are the most secure of
    all alternatives, the Meta Mask Wallet can be worthwhile especially for those
    users who actively participate in the Ethereum network and really want to use
    the tokens.

    them with each other. Through swaps, Meta Mask users receive the cheapest prices
    available on the market at the time of trading – with a relatively low transaction
    fee of up to 0.875% of the trading volume. At the same time, Meta Mask prides
    itself on offering the most secure and at the same time simplest service, so that
    users can easily use other blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps)
    – even without previous knowledge.

    charges fees for the transactions that are paid in so-called "gas" units: the
    fees are paid in "gas", while gas is paid by ETH. It should also be noted that
    the exporters of the transactions must pay the fees, regardless of whether the
    transactions are carried out successfully or not.'

    fee as well as a limit manually. However, for beginners who are not yet familiar
    with pricing, it is recommended to choose the predetermined fees. Users can then

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A DAPP is nothing more than a special form of an app. These are based on a blockchain,
    are open source and decentralized and must be able to generate their own tokens.
    Such a token is, for example, the Bitcoin, the DAPP behind it, is the Bitcoin
    network. The big advantage is that no company controls all functions, but that
    the open-source community continues to improve the DAPP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three different types of DAPPs. On the one hand, there are Type 1
    DAPPs that operate their own blockchain, such as the Bitcoin network. Now there
    are other DAPPs that rely on the blockchain of this Bitcoin network. Such DAPPs
    are called Type2\. The third type is again based on type 2 DAPPs. Microsoft Azure,
    for example, is a Type2 DAPP that is based on the Ethereum blockchain. The company
    offers an infrastructure that is used by Type 3 DAPPs, in this case, for example
    Absolut or Heineken.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, you can see that even if the Type1 DAPPs are decentralized and based on
    a blockchain, companies with Type2 or Type3 DAPPs can benefit from this. This
    creates entire networks, which explains why the systems behind the cryptocurrencies
    are becoming more and more important.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apps and DAPPs may seem relatively similar to the newcomer at first glance.
    Nevertheless, there are glaring differences, which will be discussed in more detail
    here. Apps are mostly released by companies that have full control over all the
    features of the respective app. For example, as a user, you can have no influence
    on google changing its YouTube app so that adblockers no longer work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DAPPs, on the other hand, are open source. This means that the source code is
    visible to everyone and can therefore be changed at will. If you want to redesign
    a DAPP according to your own wishes and bring the necessary know-how with you,
    you can change the source code and create your own DAPP variant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another difference is that DAPPs are always based on a blockchain and are stored
    in decentralised locations. Therefore, it is almost impossible to hack a DAPP,
    since one would have to attack the entire blockchain behind it, including all
    networked computers, at the same time in order to change the structure of the
    DAPP. An app, on the other hand, is usually supported by the respective company's
    own servers. Here you would "only" have to hack the one datacenter to bring the
    respective app under his control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, it can be said that DAPPs are both safer and freer in their development,
    as no company controls them centrally. Apps, on the other hand, are clearly owned
    by a company that has full control. Also, the source code is not publicly visible
    here, so you do not get to see the structure of the respective app without further
    ado.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How are DAPPs Defined?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The community has agreed on a clear definition of the DAPP. First, DAPPs are
    not issued and maintained by a single provider. A DAPP runs distributed and decentralized
    over a peer-to-peer network. In addition, four criteria must be met that an application
    can be called a DAPP. It first must be the source code of a DAPP open source.
    Furthermore, it must be based on a blockchain, have cryptographic encryption and
    be able to generate its own tokens. Only if all these criteria are met can we
    speak of a DAPP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: <bdi>●</bdi>Open Source
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that a DAPP is open source does not mean that every programmer can
    simply decide for himself what the DAPP should look like after its own changes
    in the future. Rather, the community decides which modifications are accepted
    and which are not. Nevertheless, the source code remains visible to everyone,
    so that every developer knows exactly what the current state of affairs is. The
    fact that a DAPP is open source ensures continuous development. No individual
    administrator or even a company sets the future direction, but the further development
    of the DAPP is controlled by the entire developer community together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, as a programmer you also have the possibility to easily redesign
    the respective source code according to your own needs and thus get a very personal
    DAPP. Of course, you should master the underlying programming language and understand
    the subtleties of the source code. Whether your own changes will actually be applied,
    however, will then be decided by the entirety of the developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: <bdi>●</bdi>Blockchain
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second criterion that every DAPP must meet is that it is based on a blockchain.
    The blockchain makes the DAPP decentralized and is stored on many different computers
    at the same time. As a result, it becomes almost impossible that a DAPP can be
    deleted or that criminals can hack into the DAPP. Well-known blockchains are,
    for example, the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network. Here, all data is stored
    on the users' PCs and not, as for example with apps, centrally on special servers.
    Such data includes the source code, all transactions of the cryptocurrencies and
    other information necessary for the smooth running of the DAPP. The blockchain
    is always the heart of a DAPP. Type1 DAPPs have their own blockchain, while Type2
    and Type3 DAPPs are based on it. Each block is completed and encrypted after a
    certain period of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: <bdi>●</bdi>Cryptographic Encryption
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cryptographic encryption of each block is used to obtain and verify all
    information in a certain period of time. If you look at the Bitcoin network, for
    example, enormous computing power is spent here to verify and store all transactions.
    So-called Bitcoin miners take over this computing power and in return receive
    rewards in the form of Bitcoin and also the transaction fees. If a block is completed,
    this is done by generating a hash. A hash is a kind of checksum that ensures that
    all transactions and information made in the previous block are authentic and
    traceable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, individual trades will be difficult to identify in retrospect, as it
    is very time-consuming to make the previous information visible again from a hash.
    The cryptographic encryption thus serves both to ensure the authenticity of all
    information, as well as the anonymization of the individual users. Therefore,
    your own data is much more secure if you use a DAPP than if you make it available
    to the providers of apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: <bdi>●</bdi>Token generation
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last criterion that must be met by a DAPP is token generation. With the
    Bitcoin network, such a token is simply the Bitcoin. The miners who provide their
    computing power to create hashes must be rewarded so that they want to fulfil
    this task. This is done using a reward in Bitcoin once a hash is found. Investors
    who speculate with cryptocurrencies know how high the Bitcoin price is today.
    So, each token has an equivalent value in real currency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The token generation only serves to make it worthwhile for the miners to provide
    their computing power. Hash generation is important for any blockchain, as it
    would no longer work without it. As a result, token generation ensures that it
    remains attractive for miners to keep the blockchain running. If all these four
    criteria are met, one can speak of a DAPP.

    undoubtedly the large crypto currencies, which are based on a proof-of-work algorithm.
    However, the networks behind it are also used by countless Type 2 and Type 3 DAPPs.
    For example, Microsoft Azure uses the Ethereum network as type 2 DAPP to provide
    specialized infrastructure for third-party users. You can see that behind the
    cryptocurrencies there is a network with which a wide variety of digital possibilities
    are provided.
  prefs: []

    games are produced that have not been designed as an app but as a DAPP. Although
    the developers cannot earn money directly with these, they can start projects
    that are constantly being further developed due to the open-source criterion.
    This creates new possibilities to create things that did not exist before.

    future. This makes it possible to circumvent the market power of app manufacturers

    social media platforms are created, social networks are set up, infrastructures
    for IT companies are created, games are developed, or trading platforms are designed
    in the DAPP form. It can be assumed that in the future more and more developers
    will program DAPPs instead of apps in order to benefit from the advantages of
    the block chain and its decentralized design. However, it should be noted that
    the division is still in its infancy. The industry relies on developers who strive
    for an ideology of the free Internet and do not want to earn money exclusively
    from development. The open-source design of the DAPPs makes it possible to make
    rapid progress on certain projects, as it is not a single company that is engaged

    for. For example, there is a virtual reality platform in DAPP format called Decentraland.
    Here you can exchange ideas with other users. A platform that specializes in market
    predictions is called Gnosis. It sees itself as a point of contact for investors
    who want to identify certain trends at an early stage. Gnosis is based on the
    Ethereum network.

    advantages are obvious. The development is not dependent on large companies but
    is decentralized and the community determines which functions are included in
    the respective DAPP and which are not. DAPPs can never be deleted due to decentralization.
    This means that a DAPP is available as long as the networked computers are online.
    The encryption and the peer-to-peer network also make it very secure against attacks
    by hackers. All data that is made available when using a DAPP is also quickly
    encrypted due to the underlying blockchain. New cryptocurrencies such as Waves
    or Elrond rely on the concept right from the start. As a result, anonymity is
    also guaranteed to a large extent.

    a social media channel, want to use a social network, want to make sports bets
    or simply want to play a game, there is already the right DAPP for each of these
    different possibilities. If blockchain technology continues to mature, it is not
    unlikely that in just a few years most users will do without central apps and
    will rather opt for DAPPs.

    DeFi sector, all the top NFT marketplaces are on Ethereum.

    most widely used ERC-721 standard, which makes the creation of individual tokens
    possible. For this, the token standard uses a new smart contract for each NFT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of NFTs and makes a theoretical creation of infinitely many tokens possible with
    a single smart contract. The ERC-1155 standard is also known as the multi-token
    standard because it handles the storage and creation of various NFTs in a single
    smart contract. It is superior to other ERC standards in that it is cheaper and
    more effective.

    Why should investors even turn over absurd sums for a fallow plot of land in the

    at the building in the world of Cryptovoxels, an investment case could actually
    be building an art gallery. An easily accessible building in which artists offer
    their works could be an attractive place for art owners who want to be paid for
    their works. In this way, another economy can develop in virtual reality.

    and feathered crypto monsters. The value for these NFT's depends on demand and
    possible uses. The value of a powerful monster is higher than that of a weak monster.
    Rare and in-demand artworks also have a higher price. You can see an example of
    an art NFT in BakerySwap below.

    interesting NFT is offered. These tokens offer much more than just the rights
    of a PNG image or song.

    snack-based NFT's are not only collectible items, they can also be used to farm
    BAKE, the platform's local token. While these NFT's have cute pictures, their
    real value comes from the financial advantages they offer.

    early days of CryptoKitties, gamification has been one of the main factors leading
    to the adoption of NFT's. There are currently many fighting feathered NFT creatures
    in the BSC that you can do much more than buy and sell and fight.

    BakerySwap, so the variety of existing NFT's also increases. NFT's can be exchanged
    for a certain amount of tokens, but you also need to destroy the item you have
    in the process.

    series of NFT characters for the collection. Each rabbit can be exchanged for
    a certain amount from the local token of the project CAKE. Similar to other buy-to-let
    assets, collectors can speculate on the value of these NFT's as the CAKE price
    fluctuates.

    offer investors besides their artistic value. If you had previously taken part
    in the PancakeSwap draw, your ticket was actually a BEP-721 NFT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The MEBs that users use to buy their tickets are collected in a pool to form
    the reward fund. Each NFT ticket contains four numbers, which must match the numbers
    in the draw in the correct order. Part of the prize fund is burned and the remaining
    amount is divided among the winners. This is a great example of how NFT can be
    much more than collectibles.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of Ethereum, BSC has a large number of projects that use, create, and
    sell NFT. The scalability of the network and low transaction fees make BSC an
    attractive alternative to other blockchains. Because the BSC network is compatible
    with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), developers can easily transfer their
    DApp created on Ethereum to BSC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a user point of view, it is more cost-effective to buy and sell NFT using
    BSC. The high fees for Ethereum transactions make NFT very expensive for small
    investors and collectors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Binance Smart Chain is rapidly growing the NFT ecosystem as more projects continue
    to benefit from the speed and affordability of this network. Whether you want
    to join the NFT wave or just trade with your collections, you can find everything
    you're looking for in the Binance Smart Chain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You've probably heard of this NFT sale. Beeple NFT's are one of the few examples
    where an event from the crypto world attracts a wide audience. Digital artist
    Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, turned the art world upside down by selling
    an NFT for ETH worth USD 69 million. The sale was made by Christie's auction house.
    Beeple, which has never sold more than $100 worth of print before, overnight became
    the world's highest valued living artist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What could be behind such a high valuation of his work? Beeple already had a
    large fan base thanks to its series, which it created and uploaded every day.
    There hasn't been a day in the last 14 years when he hasn't done that. The work
    sold was called "Everydays - The First 5000 Days" and was a collage of artworks
    created in the first 5000 days of his project.

    to Block's data dashboard, NBA Top Shot has the most users of all NFT projects.
    While this data doesn't take into account smaller and marginal NFT projects, for
    NBA Top Shot, this is a huge achievement.
  prefs: []

- en: In Dabber Labs' NBA Top Shot project, users can purchase packages of unique
    digital artworks, including famous NBA moments, as NFT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where could the success of the project come from? The impact of the NBA brand
    is undeniable. It is easier to create collectibles related to a game that many
    people are already interested in than to sell a digital pet. Another factor may
    be the user experience. The NBA top shot's failure to detect a blockchain product
    lowers the entry barrier for most people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and noticed that the products are very difficult for beginners to use? While we
    offer useful guides for products like MetaMask, there's a long way to go before
    the user experience becomes easy even for your grandmother.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NBA Top Shot avoids this by moving away from decentralization elements to improve
    the user experience. It's very possible that many users don't even realize that
    they're using a blockchain-based product, which in itself can be considered a
    success.

    of "characters", and they are all different.

    with an Ethereum wallet. In 2018, it was possible to buy a character for an average
    of 50-100 USD. But in 2021, prices have risen dramatically. As of March 2021,
    the most expensive piece to date has been sold for 4,200 ETH.
  prefs: []

- en: Getting it for free and selling it for millions of pounds doesn't seem like
    a bad investment. Although being the "first" purchaser of anything usually offers
    a price advantage, it is not possible to come across products that bring such
    a high profit in the future.

    can fight monsters together while in adventure mode and compete against each other
    in PvP (inter-player) competitions.

    land with. This can vary from a simple landscape to an interactive game.

    has its own economy. Users can interact with each other in different ways and
    cash in on their activities. But unlike other similar virtual reality games like
    Second Life, Decentraland is in full control of a decentralized group of people.
