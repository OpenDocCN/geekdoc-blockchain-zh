    social networks, financial transactions and images. Whatever be the form, at a
    very basic level, any particular digital information can be considered to be a
    sequence of bits. The length of the sequence is not fixed. It can vary quite a
    bit, from a few hundred bits for a short message to a billion (or more) bits for
    a large image.

    to associate a unique identifier to any digital information. Such an identifier
    is typically a short fixed length binary string. In many cases, it is more convenient
    to work with the unique identifier of a digital information rather than the information
    itself. Conventionlly, the digital information is called the *message* and the
    associated unique identifier is called the *digest* of the message.

    Such an ![inline-image](../images/CH016_29.jpg) is said to be a random oracle.
    The function ![inline-image](../images/CH016_30.jpg) is viewed in the following
    manner. It is queried on an element of ![inline-image](../images/CH016_31.jpg)
    and returns an element of ![inline-image](../images/CH016_32.jpg). A crucial property

    of ![inline-image](../images/CH016_33.jpg). Then ![inline-image](../images/CH016_34.jpg)
    are *independent and uniform random* elements of ![inline-image](../images/CH016_35.jpg).

    to the contract. Suppose Alice signs a digital document *M* to produce a signature
    *s*. There are two basic requirements from any such digital signature. First,
    it must be guaranteed that only Alice could have produced *s* on the message *M*.
    Second, given *M* and *s*, it must be possible for any other party (say Bob) to
    verify that *s* is indeed Alice's signature on *M*. The first condition requires
    Alice to possess some information which is available only to her. This is called
    Alice's signing (or secret) key ![inline-image](../images/CH016_53.jpg). To enable
    the second condition of public verifiability by Bob, Alice has to make public

    concurrently and pass messages to other components as and when required. One important
    characteristic is that components can fail. The failures occur independently and
    also asynchronously. Failure does not necessarily mean stoppage of operation.
    A failed component could be producing ‘garbage’ messages. In an adversarial scenario,
    a component could come under the control of an adversary who can then send out

    the final result. Alternatively, the task could be for the components to agree

    more parties. For example, one party supplies a service, while a second party
    provides payment for the service. To make a payment, a party must possess some
    amount of funds and then must provide a signed statement transferring the funds
    to another party.

    much more flexible than a transaction. It may include exit and penalty clauses
    and also may refer to unknown situations in the future. So, the language for writing
    a contract must be expressive enough to cover a whole multitude of tasks. We will
    come back to this issue when we discuss the interesting notion of smart contracts.

- en: Whether we consider a transaction or a contract, such an instrument will be
    considered valid only if it is signed by the parties who are involved. For example,
    if somebody wishes to make a payment, the person must sign the statement which
    transfers money to another person. In the physical world, this is achieved by
    a signed cheque. So, the signature of the person making the payment is the key
    issue. Moving to the digital world, a transaction needs to be signed. For doing
    this, a digital signature scheme is used. Suppose Alice wishes to make a payment
    of $100 to Bob. She uses her signing key ![inline-image](../images/CH017_1.jpg)
    to digitally sign the statement ‘I transfer $100 to Bob’. This statement is considered
    to be a message *M*, and the signing algorithm is invoked on *M* and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_2.jpg)
    to produce the signature *s*. Using the verification algorithm and Alice's verification
    key ![inline-image](../images/CH017_3.jpg), anybody can verify that *s* is indeed
    Alice's signature on the message *M*. For the moment, let us consider transactions
    to be signed statement of this type. Later, we will consider somewhat more details.

    account of a party to another party. Such a transaction will have a small size.
    On the other hand, a transaction may also record payment from multiple accounts
    of a party to several parties. This will have a larger size. A block usually has
    a fixed size. So, depending upon the sizes of the transactions, it may store a
    variable number of transactions. This, however, is not important for a conceptual
    understanding. It is enough to view a block as storing a number of transactions.

    a blockchain. The relevance of cryptographic properties of the hash function to
    the immutability of a blockchain has been explained. Next comes the question of
    how a blockchain is maintained. The short answer to this is that a blockchain
    is maintained in a distributed fashion. In this section, we elaborate further
    on this.

    distributed across the planet. There would be differences in the complexities
    of the parties. For the present, we ignore such differences and consider each
    party to be a node of the system. Again, for simplicity, we assume a node to be
    a computer. These nodes are connected to each other using the internet (or, maybe
    a part of it). So, one particular node can communicate directly to only a small
    number of nodes in its neighbourhood. This is the setting of P2P network, as has
    been described in Section 16.2.1.

    ledger. The question then arises as to who maintains the public ledger. The answer
    is that all the nodes maintain the public ledger, i.e. each node maintains a copy
    of the public ledger. Since we are considering that the public ledger is implemented
    as a blockchain, it follows that each node maintains a copy of the blockchain.
    Since the blockchain is distributed across the whole network, the resulting public
    ledger is often called distributed public ledger. At this point, a crucial question
    arises. How is it ensured that the copies of the blockchain maintained by the
    different nodes are consistent? Below we address this issue.

- en: Let us consider a particular node *v*. Transactions occur at the node *v*, i.e.
    the entity responsible for the node *v* may initiate transactions. These transactions
    are to be entered into the blockchain. So, node *v* uses the gossip protocol of
    the P2P network to send out the transactions to a subset of its neighbouring nodes.
    These neighbouring nodes further propagate the transactions until the transactions
    reach the entire network. Usually the gossip network is quite efficient and a
    transaction reaches the entire network within a few seconds (or, even less time).
    Similarly, node *v* receives transactions which have occurred at other nodes in
    the network.

    The blockchain consists of blocks where each block is a group of transactions.
    Each node also receives transactions which have occurred in the network. Along
    with a copy of the blockchain, each node also maintains a list of transactions
    which have so far not entered the blockchain. This is the set of ‘un-blocked’
    transactions. Note that at a particular point of time, the list of un-blocked
    transactions maintained by the different nodes need not be the same; in fact,
    they will mostly be different. This is because a transaction generated at a particular
    node will require some time to travel throughout the network. Until it has reached
    all the nodes in the system, a subset of nodes will be recording it as ‘un-blocked’
    while the other nodes will not even be knowing about it.

    previous block *B* *r*−1 in ![inline-image](../images/CH017_37.jpg), ![inline-image](../images/CH017_38.jpg)
    is the set of transactions in the block *B* and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_39.jpg)
    is a quantity which plays a special role. Node *v* takes a group of transactions
    from ![inline-image](../images/CH017_40.jpg) and checks the validity of each of
    these transactions. The checking of validity includes checking proper format and
    the verifications of the digital signatures of the various parties in a transaction.
    If a check fails, then *v* rejects the corresponding transaction and removes it
    from ![inline-image](../images/CH017_41.jpg). Once all the checks succeed, *v*
    takes this group of transactions to be ![inline-image](../images/CH017_42.jpg).
    Node *v* then computes ![inline-image](../images/CH017_43.jpg). Next, it attempts
    to obtain a suitable value for ![inline-image](../images/CH017_44.jpg) so as to
    be able to form a block ![inline-image](../images/CH017_45.jpg). We will later
    explain how ![inline-image](../images/CH017_46.jpg) is obtained. Once node *v*
    has been able to form block ![inline-image](../images/CH017_47.jpg), it removes
    the transactions in ![inline-image](../images/CH017_48.jpg) from ![inline-image](../images/CH017_49.jpg),
    inserts ![inline-image](../images/CH017_50.jpg) into ![inline-image](../images/CH017_51.jpg)
    as the new header and propagates this block to the network using the gossip protocol.
    So, apart from transactions, nodes in the network also propagate blocks that they
    have created.

    It checks whether ![inline-image](../images/CH017_53.jpg) and if this is true,
    it then inserts *B* as the new header in ![inline-image](../images/CH017_54.jpg)
    and removes the transactions in *R* from ![inline-image](../images/CH017_55.jpg).
    This results in the extension of the copy of the blockchain ![inline-image](../images/CH017_56.jpg)
    available with node *v* by one block. The gossip protocol ensures that the block
    *B* reaches all the nodes. Assuming that all nodes have the same copy of the blockchain,
    each node extends its copy of the blockchain by the block *B* and again all nodes
    in the network have the same copy of the blockchain. Recall that the start of
    the blockchain is by the genesis block which all nodes certainly have. So, ignoring
    conflicts, each node maintains the same copy of the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conflicts, however, do arise. The nodes are creating blocks concurrently and
    independently of each other. Whenever a block is created, it is transmitted to
    the gossip network. Further, the list of un-blocked transactions maintained by
    the nodes is different. So, blocks created by different nodes will not necessarily
    have the same set of transactions. It is quite possible that the node *v* almost
    simultaneously receives two different blocks ![inline-image](../images/CH017_57.jpg)
    and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_58.jpg) such that ![inline-image](../images/CH017_59.jpg).
    In other words, both the blocks *B* and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_60.jpg)
    are compatible with the copy of the blockchain ![inline-image](../images/CH017_61.jpg)
    maintained by *v*. Note that one of the blocks *B* and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_62.jpg)
    could have been created by *v* itself. At this point, there needs to be some kind
    of a conflict resolution mechanism to determine which of the two blocks *B* and
    ![inline-image](../images/CH017_63.jpg) is to be inserted as the new header of
    ![inline-image](../images/CH017_64.jpg). The overall protocol for the blockchain
    will specify this conflict resolution mechanism. Later we will consider the special
    case of the Bitcoin protocol. For the moment, it is sufficient to note that one
    of the blocks *B* and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_65.jpg) is entered as the
    new header by *v*, while the other block is rejected. Suppose block *B* is accepted
    and ![inline-image](../images/CH017_66.jpg) is rejected. So, in some sense the
    blockchain protocol has to define when block *B* will be preferred over block
    ![inline-image](../images/CH017_67.jpg). Note that this preference relation is
    specified by the blockchain protocol and is followed by all the nodes in the network.
    So, all the nodes will prefer *B* over ![inline-image](../images/CH017_68.jpg)
    and extend their copies of the blockchain using *B* rather than ![inline-image](../images/CH017_69.jpg).
    This is a kind of consensus among the nodes and the preference relation of the
    blockchain protocol essentially specifies the consensus algorithm.

    blockchain is not only restricted to the two blocks which are received almost

    and it finds that *H*(*B* [*i*]−1) = *h*. This means that the blockchain (*B*

    block *B* or of modifying its copy of the blockchain to (*B* 0,…,*B* [*i*]−1,
    *B*) and rejecting blocks ![inline-image](../images/CH017_72.jpg). The actual
    decision on which option node *v* should choose is also determined by the conflict

    of all the nodes is ![inline-image](../images/CH017_74.jpg) and all of them receive
    block *B*. Further suppose that the rules of the blockchain protocol dictates
    that the blockchain must be modified to ![inline-image](../images/CH017_75.jpg).
    At this point, some of the nodes in the network decide to follow the protocol
    and update the local copies of the their blockchain while the rest of the nodes
    discard block *B* and continue with the blockchain ![inline-image](../images/CH017_76.jpg).
    This gives rise to two different blockchains which are the same up to block *B*
    [*i*]−1 and then forks into two distinct chains. The two disjoint subsets of nodes
    which work on the two different blockchains will no longer accept blocks and transactions
    from each other. Effectively, this results in a partition of the network into
    two different parts. This process is called forking of the blockchain and also
    the network. Forking can arise for a number of reasons. One important reason for
    a fork to occur is a change in the blockchain protocol which is accepted by a
    subset of nodes, but, not by the other nodes. In the context of cryptocurrency,
    forking may lead to one cryptocurrency being split into two cryptocurrencies.

    to maintain a public ledger of interal records. This would be very convenient,
    since the public ledger would be accessible to all internal members of the organisation.
    Such a public ledger is not really public, since the organisation might not wish
    to reveal its internal documents to entities outside the organisation. Further,
    it may also wish to provide access to the ledger only to a set of privileged members
    of the organisation. So, permission from some central authority is required to

    how the currency is created. We will, however, defer this point. Let us assume
    that there is a unit of cryptocurrency and it exists. Existence of a cryptocurrency
    means that various amounts of it are held by different owners. At any point of
    time, the total amount of a cryptocurrency is the sum of the various amounts of
    the cryptocurrency held by the different owners. So, there is no existence of
    the cryptocurrency outside ownership.

    of physical currency can mean various things. One important consequence of ownership
    is that it provides the owner with the privilege of spending the amount of currency
    that is held by the owner. The spending is effected by transferring (a part of)
    the amount held by the owner to another entity. This later entity then becomes
    the new owner of the said amount of the currency.

    of cryptocurrency owned by one public key ![inline-image](../images/CH018_8.jpg)
    to one or more public keys ![inline-image](../images/CH018_9.jpg). So, there is
    a spender public key ![inline-image](../images/CH018_10.jpg) and a set of recipient
    public keys ![inline-image](../images/CH018_11.jpg). The statement of transfer
    is considered to be a message *M*. This message is digitally signed with the signing
    key ![inline-image](../images/CH018_12.jpg) corresponding to ![inline-image](../images/CH018_13.jpg)
    to produce a signature *s*. The task of signing represents the spender's commitment
    to the transaction. Since signing keys are not made public, only the physical
    entity who possesses the signing key ![inline-image](../images/CH018_14.jpg) can
    sign off on the transfer of funds. The statement of transfer *M* along with the
    signature *s* constitute a transaction.

    in Chapter 17, transactions are grouped together into blocks, and the blocks are
    organised into the blockchain. The blockchain is public and constitutes the public
    ledger. So, any transaction which is part of the blockchain is publicly available.
    In the above, we have discussed how the transfer of cryptocurrency from one public
    key to another public key is effected. There is also a method for creating specific
    amounts of cryptocurrency and assigning it to a public key, and this information
    is also available on the blockchain. (We will discuss the procedure for creation
    of cryptocurrency later.) So, a certain amount of cryptocurrency gets created
    and assigned to a public key; a transaction distributes this amount to a set of
    public keys; subsequent transactions, in turn, distribute the amounts to other
    public keys and so on. All such information is available on the blockchain. Consequently,
    at any point of time, using the blockchain, it is possible to determine whether
    a particular public key indeed possesses a stated amount of cryptocurrency. As
    a result, it is possible to verify whether the spender public key in a transaction
    is indeed the owner of the amount it spends in the transaction.

    of the activities of the nodes in such a network is to group transactions into
    blocks. Before including a transaction into a block, a node verifies the transaction.
    Apart from basic verification, such as the sum of the amount transferred to the
    recipient public keys is at most the amount owned by the spender public keys,
    this verification consists of two essential tasks. The first is to determine whether
    the spender public key indeed owns the amount of cryptocurrency to be transferred,
    and the second is the verification of the signature in the transaction. If either
    of these checks fail, the transaction is discarded. Otherwise, the node includes
    it in the list of transactions and attempts to create a block.

    keys. Further, the sum of the amounts of the cryptocurrency transferred to all

    it can later spend the amount *z* assigned to ![inline-image](../images/CH018_35.jpg).
    Note that if *y* + *z* = *x*, then there is no transaction fee. Entity *A* may

    blocks, i.e. each such window is a constant difficulty period. At the end of a
    window of 2,016 blocks, the time to compute these blocks is considered. If this
    time is less than 2 weeks, then it indicates that the hash rate *ν* of the network
    has gone up, while if the time is more than 2 weeks, then the hash rate has gone
    down. The value of *d* is accordingly adjusted. We do not provide the exact details
    of this procedure, since that is not required for a conceptual understanding of
    the idea. It is sufficient to note that if less than 2 weeks' time was required,

    then the value of *d* is increased. In the next window of 2,016 blocks, the value

    of size 210,000 blocks. At the rate of about 10 mintues for mining a block, the
    time for mining 210,000 blocks is about 4 years. In each window of 210,000 blocks,
    the amount of Bitcoin created by the mining of a new block remains constant. At
    the end of 210,000 blocks, this amount is halved. In the first window of 210,000
    blocks, the mining of each new block created 50 Bitcoins. In the next window of
    210,000, the mining of each new block created 25 bitcoins. The Bitcoin protocol
    is designed so that there are 64 such halving events. After that, the mining of
    a new block will not create any new Bitcoin. At the rate of 10 minutes per block,
    this event is expected to occur sometime in the year 2140\. The total amount of
    Bitcoin that can be created is 21 million. When no more new Bitcoin can be created,

    the members of the pool according to some formula based on the shares of the work

    The metadata for all blocks contain a provision for indicating support to a proposed
    BIP. This is in the form of a bit. The miner which mines the block, sets the bit
    to 1 if it supports the associated BIP, otherwise it is set to 0\. Several BIPs

    its support or lack of it by setting the associated bit in the metadata of the

    26 such constant difficulty periods. If in any such constant difficulty period,
    a BIP obtains support above a certain threshold number of blocks, then in the
    next difficulty period, all entities who wish to adopt the new rules can do so.
    The required threshold is 1,916 blocks (which is roughly 95% of 2016, the number
    of blocks mined in a 2-week period). Once the desired level of support is obtained

    blocks which follow the old rules will be accepted only by the nodes which follow

    value in doing so and this value arises from a broad acceptability of the cryptocurrency.

    peg it to another asset. This later asset can be a fiat currency or some exchange-traded

    has been designed to withstand high price volatility is called a stablecoin. A
    stablecoin could be either centralised or decentralised.

    by performing the peg. The peg itself could be to a fiat currency which is maintained
    in some bank or in some kind of regulated financial institution which can serve
    as a depositary of the fiat currency used to peg the stablecoin. Alternatively,
    the peg could be to some exchange-traded commodity such as precious metals. The
    amount of the back-up currency or commodity used for the peg has to reflect the
    actual amount of the stablecoin in circulation. Since the value of the peg varies
    outside the space of the stablecoin, it protects the stablecoin from wild price
    fluctuations. Variation in the price of the underlying asset, however, will have
    an effect on the price of the stablecoin. Nonetheless, due to arbitrage, it is
    unlikely that the price of a stablecoin will drop below the price of the asset
    used for the peg. The main criticism of centralised stablecoin is the use of the
    trusted party which goes against the basic ethos of cryptocurrency.

    Bitcoin can process about seven transactions per second. Payment systems such
    as Visa can process about two thousand transactions per second. So, if Bitcoin
    is to become competitive with Visa, there must be some way of speeding up transaction
    settlements. Further, for small payments, such as for a cup of coffee, waiting
    several minutes for the relevant transaction to be confirmed is rather impractical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One proposed solution to this problem has been called the lightning network.
    The idea is *not* to use the blockchain to confirm each and every transaction.
    Suppose two entities transfer funds between themselves quite often. To do this,
    they create a payment channel. Such a channel is created by both of them depositing
    an agreed upon amount of cryptocurrency to a 2-out-of-2 multi-signature address.
    Such an address arises from a special type of signature scheme which requires
    the consent of both the parties for the amount to be spent. Such a payment channel
    is a transaction, but it is not immediately broadcast to the network. Once the
    payment channel is created, the two entities can issue transactions to each other
    which essentially redistribute the total amount in the payment channel between
    themselves. These transactions are scripted so that the previous transactions
    are invalidated. None of these transactions are broadcast to the network. At some
    point, both or one of the entities may wish to finalise the deal. The latest transaction
    is then broadcast to the network and confirmed on the blockchain. So, instead
    of all the micropayments that occurred on the payment channel, only one transaction
    gets confirmed on the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is not feasible for every pair of entities to set up payment channels between
    themselves. Instead it is envisaged that there will be a network of such small
    micropayment channels. The two entities which wish to transact will be connected
    by an appropriate path of payment channels.

    of transactions per second. It was initially proposed for Bitcoin. Subsequent
    work has led to development of lightning network for other cryptocurrencies. Note
    that transactions made on the payment channel are not confirmed on the blockchain.
    So, it is unlikely that large payments will be made using the lightning network.

    benefit from the speed of the lightning network.

    with its independent blockchain. One of these chains is identified as the main
    chain, and the other chain is called a sidechain. Suppose it is required to transfer
    a certain amount from the main chain to the sidechain. To do this, an entity issues
    a transaction on the main chain where a payment is made to a specified address.
    This locks the amount on the main chain and the entity can no longer use this
    amount on the main chain. After a waiting period, an equivalent amount of cryptocurrency
    is released on the sidechain to the entity. This entity can now make payments
    on the sidechain. This essentially pegs the amount on the sidechain to the amount
    locked on the main chain. A similar procedure is adopted to transfer money from
    the sidechain to the mainchain. The two-way peg is enabled by a federation which
    is a group of servers acting as an intermediary between the main chain and the
    sidechain.

    with transactions of only a specific type. Sidechains can also be used to enhance
    the capabilities of a blockchain. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain does not

    is to allow only a subset of nodes to participate in the mining process. For example,
    entities which hold a certain amount of the cryptocurrency can only participate
    in the generation of the next block. The amount of cryptocurrency held by an entity

    whether it is part of the committee. No interaction is required at this step.
    The committee members exchange messages to determine the next block. The scheme

    be handled? For example, one may wish to describe a contract between two parties.
    Such a contract could be a simple thing like a small loan or it could even be
    the sale of a car. Further, the execution of a contract could depend on an event
    in the future such as the price of some share in a stock exchange. The main innovation
    of Ethereum is the ability to handle all such scenarios and more.

    and consider what it means to compute something. This was an important question
    in the early decades of the twentieth century. An answer was provided by Alan
    Turing who proposed a very simple model of computation which is now called a Turing
    machine. Turing also introduced the notion of universality and proposed the construction
    of a universal Turing machine which is capable of simulating any Turing machine.
    The intuitive notion of computation by itself is hard to define and so it cannot
    be formally proved that Turing machines can indeed compute all that may be intuitively
    considered to be computable. The Church–Turing thesis is the hypothesis that this
    is indeed the case, i.e. our intuitive notion of computation is exactly captured
    by a universal Turing machine.

- en: Turing machines are not the only possible models of computation. Alternative
    systems such as the lambda calculus and recursive functions have been proposed.
    All of these systems have been shown to be equivalent. In particular, this means,
    for example, that the lambda calculus system of rules can be used to simulate
    a universal Turing machine. More generally, a language consisting of rules to
    manipulate data is said to be Turing complete if it can be used to simulate a
    universal Turing machine and by extension any Turing machine.

    describe complex scenarios is to ensure that the language is Turing complete.
    Ethereum provides such a language (subject to some practical limitations). This
    allows Ethereum to describe contracts, and more generally, to describe autonomous
    agents of almost arbitrary complexity.

    A useful view of what happens is that of a state transition system. At any point
    of time, among other things, the blockchain provides a record of all the Bitcoins
    that have been generated so far. This information can be summarised as a state
    where the state is a list of addresses and the amount of Bitcoins held by each
    address. A block consists of a list of transactions which essentially transfers
    Bitcoins from one set of addresses to another set of addresses. After the creation
    of a new block, we obtain a new state. So, the processing of a list of transactions
    by the creation of a new block can be considered to be transition from one state
    to another.

    a nonce; the account''s present Ether balance (Ether is a unit of currency in
    Ethereum); a program to describe a contract (which is optional); and the account''s
    storage. Each account has an address. Accounts are of two types, namely, user
    (or externally owned) account and contract account. A user account does not have
    any program, while contract accounts have associated programs. Each account has
    an address which is computed by applying a hash function to the address of the
    creator of the account along with the relevant nonce of the creator account.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interaction between accounts is enabled by passing messages from one account
    to another. Messages can be created by both user and contract accounts and can
    contain data. Further, if the recipient of a message is a contract account, then
    there is an option to return a response. In Ethereum, the term transaction is
    used to denote a signed message sent from a user account. The sending of a message
    from any account increments the nonce of the account. For a contract account,
    every time a message is received, the code is activated. This allows the contract
    account to read and write its internal storage and send other messages or even
    create new contracts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An Ethereum state is a snapshot of the set of accounts. A state transition takes
    place by the processing of a list of messages. Each message alters the values
    of the internal variables of one or more accounts. This alteration may be due
    to the execution of the code inside a contract account. Processing of a message
    may also lead to the creation of new accounts. So, a snapshot of the set of accounts
    after processing of the messages is the new state of the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us now see how this state transition view is mapped to a blockchain. A block
    in the Ethereum blockchain contains a copy of the messages/transactions that have
    been processed as well as the most recent state. Along with this, it stores two
    other values, the block number and the difficulty. Blocks are chained together
    through a proof-of-work style mechanism using a hash function. This part is the
    same as the basic blockchain technology. Validating a block consists of several
    actions such as verifying timestamp, reference to the previous block, difficulty
    and other checks. One important check is to ensure that applying the messages
    in the present block to the state recorded in the previous block leads to the
    state recorded in the present block. Note that this validation step requires applying
    messages to the individual accounts which for contract accounts means running
    the program embedded in such accounts.

    For example, one may describe a contract account to transfer a certain amount
    of money if the price of some share in a stock exchange reaches a certain value.
    Once such a contract is released to the network, mining nodes will check the relevant
    stock ticker and execute the code at the appropriate time in the future. It will
    not be required for the original creator of the account to initiate any further
    action. Such a provision can greatly facilitate the generation and execution of
    financial derivatives.

    permissionless cryptocurrencies. Nodes introduce messages and transactions into
    the network. Miners collect together a set of such messages/transactions and compete
    with each other to create the next block to be inserted into the blockchain. Newly
    created blocks are propagated through the P2P network. Nodes maintain their private
    copies of the blockchain and follow the consensus algorithm of Ethereum for updating
    this copy. Before adding a new block to their private copies, nodes have to validate
    the block. Among other things, this constitutes running the programs for the relevant
    contract accounts. So, the programs for each contract account are executed on
    all the nodes of the network. While this can be considered to be a wastage of
    computational power, such independent executions of a contract program by the
    nodes essentially ensures that no trusted third party is required in the entire
    set-up.

    of Ether and a sophisticated incentive policy for execution of contracts so as
    to reimburse the cost of the miners who run the code for the contracts. Over the
    years, Ethereum has suffered its own problems such as the exploitation of a software
    flaw in a contract to steal the equivalent of about $50 million Ether. There have

    a set of accounts to another set of accounts. Users can directly make payments
    to users they trust. Alternatively, the Ripple network attempts to build a line
    of trust between two users where two consecutive parties in the line have mutual
    trust. One of the major roles of XRP is to serve as the main liquidity holding
    in the network. An entity can convert its preferred token to XRP, the payment
    is made in XRP and at the receiving end, XRP is converted into the preferred token
    of the recipient. Another role of XRP is to secure the network against certain
    kinds of overloading attacks. Each transaction requires burning up a small amount
    of XRP. The amount by itself is so small that for a transaction it is an insignificant
    cost. However, if an entity tries to overload the system with a huge number of
    transactions, then the cost in XRP to such an entity will also be huge which serves
    as a deterrent.

    by becoming a node in the network. Each server maintains a copy of the ledger.
    The ledger is updated every few seconds using a consensus mechanism. The last-closed
    ledger is the most recent state of the ledger that has been ratified by the consensus
    mechanism. The open ledger is the one which is currently being confirmed. Once
    confirmed this becomes the last closed ledger. The history of all payments is
    available in the list of states of the ledgers that have been confirmed till date.

    trust the nodes in UNL as a whole. For this, individual trust in each node in
    UNL is not required. For example, if the UNL of a node includes a bank in the
    US and a bank in China, the node may assume that two such banks are unlikely to
    collude even if it may not trust the individual banks.

    the ledger. All the servers attempt to include every valid transaction when a
    new consensus round starts. The consensus protocol proceeds in several rounds.
    To start the protocol, each server takes all valid transactions it has received
    prior to the beginning of the consensus protocol which have not yet been applied.
    The server makes these transactions public as a candidate list of transactions.
    Each server then takes the union of the candidate sets of all the nodes in its
    UNL and votes on the transactions. A server decides to proceed with a transaction
    in the next round if the transaction receives a certain minimum percentage of
    approving votes. For the final round of consensus, a server decides to accept
    a transaction if the transaction is approved by at least 80% of the server's UNL.
    Finally, the server applies the accepted transactions to its copy of the open
    ledger, and the updated ledger becomes the last closed ledger.

    agreement and termination. Correctness is shown by arguing that if the number
    of Byzantine nodes in the network is below a certain level, then no invalid transaction
    will be confirmed by the consensus protocol. Agreement refers to the fact that
    if the nodes start out with the same state of the ledger, then after the execution
    of the consensus protocol, all the nodes again have the same state of the ledger.
    Finally, it can be argued that the consensus protocol terminates and each valid
    transaction gets applied to the ledger within a finite amount of time. In practice,
    Ripple network is reported to be able to handle about 1,500 transactions per second,
    making it much faster than blockchain-based technologies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
