- en: Ethereum was first described in 2013 in a whitepaper written by Vitalik Buterin,
    who was very active in the Bitcoin community as a writer and programmer. Buterin
    saw that there was significantly more potential in Bitcoin than the ability to
    move value without a central authority. He had been contributing to the colored
    coin effort within Bitcoin to expand the utility of Bitcoin beyond the trade of
    its native token. Buterin believed that other business and government use cases
    that require a central authority to control them could also be built with blockchain
    structures.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At that time, there was a fierce debate about the Bitcoin network being “bloated”
    by lots of low-value transactions from applications securing themselves against
    Bitcoin. The main concerns were that additional applications, built on the Bitcoin
    protocol, would have problems scaling in volume. Bitcoin was not built to handle
    the number of transactions needed by the applications. Vitalik and many others
    saw that in order for people to build decentralized applications in the Bitcoin
    blockchain, either the blockchain would need a massive code overhaul or they would
    need to build a new blockchain altogether.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bitcoin had already been well established at that point. It was clear that the
    kinds of upgrades to core code that were needed were well beyond what was realistically
    possible. The politics of Bitcoin would stall any changes to the network. Vitalik
    and his team established the Ethereum Foundation in early 2014 to raise funds
    to build a blockchain with a programming language built within it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial development was funded by an online public crowd sale during July
    and August of 2014\. The foundation initially raised a record $18 million through
    the sale of its cryptocurrency token called ether. People have passionately debated
    whether this sort of crowd sale is illegal because it may constitute an unlicensed
    security.

    edge nature of the project has attracted more attention and talent to the foundation.
    Discontented and disenfranchised developers and entrepreneurs from around the
    world have flocked to the project. Decentralization is seen as the perfect solution
    to corrupt and oppressive central authorities.

    a large development team to build Ethereum. Ethereum Frontier, the first release
    of the Ethereum network, went live to the public in July 2015\. It was a bare-bones
    software release that only the more technically savvy could use to build their
    own applications.

    pseudo-randomly with the possibility of being selected increasing based on their
    stake in the network. Their stake is measured by the amount of cryptocurrency
    in their possession. The main benefit of the change will be the reduction in cost
    of energy associated with proof of work. This may make it more attractive for
    individuals to run nodes in the network, which would increase decentralization
    and increase security.  ## Ethereum: The Open-Source World Wide Computer'

    *Turing-complete programming language* (a full-functioning programing language
    that allows developers to build any type of application). The Ethereum protocol
    can do just about anything that your average programming languages can do, except
    it’s built inside a blockchain and has the added benefits and security that comes
    with that. If you can imagine a software project, it can be built on Ethereum.

    genre of applications. You can take just about any business, government, or organization’s
    processes and build a digital representation of it inside of Ethereum. Currently,
    Ethereum’s platform is being explored to manage *digital assets* (a new class
    of asset that lives online and may represent a whole digital asset such as a Bitcoin
    token or a digital representation of a real-world asset such as corn commodities),
    financial instruments (like mortgage-backed securities), recording ownership of
    assets such as land, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a new
    way of organizing a business, nonprofit, government, or any other body that needs
    to come to agreement and work together for common interest. DAOs are built primarily
    on the Ethereum platform.

    central party to enforce the contract. The Ethereum protocol “enforces” smart
    contracts by attaching economic pressure. They can also enforce implementation
    of a requirement if it lives within Ethereum, because Ethereum can prove certain
    conditions were or were not met. If it doesn’t live within Ethereum, it’s much
    harder to enforce.

    universe possible. In that sense, Ether is the substance that makes Ethereum possible.
    Ether incentivizes the network to secure itself through proof-of-work mining,
    like how the token Bitcoin incentivizes the Bitcoin network. Ether is needed to
    execute any code within the Ethereum network. When utilized to execute a contract
    in Ethereum, Ether is referred to as *gas.*

    your knowledge of Ethereum, but as with all new technologies, Ethereum is quickly
    evolving. Keep reviewing best practices and security measures.

    your first few DAOs, build smart contracts, and debug your new blockchain systems.

    haven’t been fully vetted. Large contracts are more often targeted by hackers.
    The DAO hack described earlier in this chapter (see the sidebar “[With great power
    comes … great power](#c05-fea-0001)”) showed that even well thought-out contracts
    have unexpected weaknesses.

    smart contracts'

- en: Smart contract programming requires a different mind-set than standard contract
    writing. There is no third party to make things right if the contract executes
    in a way that you didn’t expect or intend. The immutable and distributed nature
    of blockchains makes it tough to change an unwanted outcome.

    Build safety valves into your contracts so you can respond to bugs and vulnerabilities
    as they come up. Smart contracts also need an off switch that let you pull the
    plug and pause your contract when things are going wrong.'

    of errors and attack vectors. Keep your contract logic simple. Build out small
    modules that hold each section of the contract. Creating a contract in this manner
    will help you compartmentalize any issues.  ### Finding bugs in the system'

    Instead, leverage the work that the community has already done and that has been
