- en: Social media is a platform where people communicate, interact, share ideas,
    interest in careers, photos, videos, etc. The study says that social media provides
    an opportunity to observe human behavioral traits, spatial and temporal relationships.
    Based on study Crime analysis using social media data such as Facebook, Newsfeed
    articles, Twitter, etc. is becoming one of the emerging areas of research across
    the world. Using spatial and temporal relationships of social media data, it is
    possible to extract useful data to analyse criminal activities. The research focuses
    on implementing textual data analytics by collecting the data from different news
    feeds and provides visualization. This research’s motivation was identified based
    on relevant work from different social media crime and Indian government crime
    statistics. This article focuses on 68 types of different crime keywords for identifying
    the type of crime. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm is used to classify the
    crime into subcategories of classes with geographical factors, and temporal factors
    from RSS feeds. Mallet package is used for extracting the keywords from the newsfeeds.
    K-means algorithm is used to identify the hotspots in the crime locations. KDE
    algorithm is used to identify the density of crime, and also our approach has
    overcome the challenges in the existing KDE algorithm. The outcome of research
    validated the proposed crime prediction model with that of the ARIMA model and
    found equivalent prediction performance.

    agencies are focusing on methods that enable them to predict future attacks. This
    enables them to utilize their limited resources effectively. These agencies’ major
    challenges are the complexities involved in the processing of large volumes of
    data. The variety of geographical diversity and the complexity of crime data have
    made crime analysis difficult. Researchers are focusing their efforts on data
    mining algorithms that can extract meaningful information from crime data.

    feed data about crime in the Bangalore region. Social media data has rich data
    about user emotions on a particular topic. The main advantage of this kind of
    data is that it has precise spatial and temporal coordinates. These spatial-temporal
    data can be used for crime prediction which can be processed with linguistic analysis
    and statistical topical modeling. Social media data can be used as auxiliary sources
    and traditional data sources to increase the accuracy of the prediction. However,
    there are also limitations in using social media data. Tweets have inconsistent
    information, misspellings, fly word invention, syntactic structures and symbol
    use that computational algorithms cannot handle. Even though the content has real-time,
    personalized content, it is difficult to process. Newsfeed has been used as the
    primary source of data in this paper. The data needs to be processed with automated
    text analysis, smart segregation and filtering methods.

    of local events, enables understanding of the severity, consequences and the time-evolving
    nature of the crime. The spatiotemporal analysis has been done based on volume
    based importance. In this case, the messages are extracted from news feed data
    and then filtered and sorted by space and time. One of the significant challenges
    in using news feed data is that the critical information is largely obscured by
    large volumes of incomplete, inconsistent and inaccurate data.

    The understanding of crime behaviors has been limited until the advent of big
    data. Crime generally occurs in clusters. This has direct implications on the
    crime prevention strategies of law enforcement agencies. Criminal activities are
    on the rise in Bangalore’s major cities (Authorized data-Karnataka State Police
    [[19](#CR19)]). This has been attributed to the population density, urban immigration
    and the existence of slums in the city area. By understanding the factors that
    drive criminal behavior in spatial and temporal terms, law enforcement agencies
    can identify crime clusters and take appropriate action.

    due to conditions called crime generators. The first success of crime encourages
    the criminal to conduct the activity repeatedly within their surroundings. Criminals
    create a safety zone around their surroundings and then gradually expand the area.
    They do serial offending and repeat victimization. It is found that nearly 68%
    of the crime happens in the same area. The consistent occurrence of crime in a
    particular area creates a crime hotspot. This leads to multiple social and economic
    consequences for the crime clusters, e.g. depreciating house prices, increased
    fear, etc. The discovery of crime clusters requires focused and prompt police
    action. By observing the possible stimulants of crime, the risk can be identified.

    mapping and spatial analysis of crime events have evolved. Various software systems,
    such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are developed to visualize crime
    patterns in different geographical regions [[9](#CR9)]. The geographical position
    information is available in the FIR raised by the law enforcement authorities.
    This data is then utilized to create insights for a better understanding of criminal
    activities. The spatial analysis techniques and GIS mapping and modeling enable
    lawmakers and policing agencies to determine the distribution of criminal activity
    and the likelihood of their reoccurrence. GIS is essential in studying criminal
    trends and criminal activities [[10](#CR10)].

    to analyze crime. The environmental analysis can be done on three levels: Micro,
    meso, and macro. Microanalysis focuses on specific crime sites, meso analysis
    identifies crime patterns at the neighborhood level, and macro analysis compares
    crime distribution across countries. Crime pattern theory states that crime does
    not occur uniformly in space and time. There are definite crime hotspots [[17](#CR17)].
    Spatial analysis can help identify the hotspots based on the movement of people,
    their daily activities, places they go and the areas where they live and work.
    Some locations such as sports stadiums or shopping areas are crime generators
    that are more suitable for criminal offenses. Others are crime attractors that
    include clubs and bars which are more prone to victimization [[11](#CR11)].'

    visually. Its applications include an operational briefing of police patrols,
    measurement, and analysis of crime patterns, performance analysis, intelligence
    development and crime reduction partnerships [[8](#CR8)]. In essence, hotspot
    mapping helps determine where the next crime will happen to make use of data from
    the past to predict the future. It uses the principle that the retrospective patterns
    of crime are the best indicators of future crime patterns. Various mapping techniques
    are used to identify and explore patterns of crime [[2](#CR2)]. These techniques
    can be simple as representing crime data as points and visualizing their geographical
    distribution, use of Geographical information systems (GIS) to shade areas or
    represent the crime distribution using volumetric densities of geographic distribution.
    Different hotspot techniques produce different results in terms of size, location,

    is used for summarizing the data gathered over multiple dimensions. It can be
    used in various ways such as identifying underlying trends in data and estimating
    the density function. Kernel density estimation applies to observed data [[15](#CR15)].
    It is a descriptive measure and provides approximate predictions for future data.
    In this method, the function known as the kernel is applied to each data point.
    It averages the point location concerning that of other data points. It can be
    extended to multiple dimensions and is effective in estimating geographical density.
    Kernel density estimation is used to visualize spatial data patterns such as crime
    density in a particular region. Studies from Boppuru et al. [[25](#CR25)] have

    The spatial pattern of each crime point is measurable using Kernel density estimation.
    The strength is estimated by counting the events in a unit area [[20](#CR20)].
    It can also be calculated using many events in the circle, slide circle to statistic
    and then divided by the circle area. ARIMA is used to capture even the complex
    relationships since it can take error terms and observations of the lagged terms.
    These models are based on regressing a variable on past values [[16](#CR16)].
    The ARIMA model’s essence is that past time points of time series data can impact
    current and future time points. ARIMA models use this concept to forecast current
    as well as future values. ARIMA uses several lagged observations of time series
    to predict observations. A specific weight is applied to each of the past terms,
    and the weights can vary based on how recent they are.

    models. This method works in three iterative steps. It includes model identification
    as the first step, parameter estimation as the second step, and diagnostic checking
    as the third step. Model identification ensures that the time series generated
    will have auto correlational properties [[30](#CR30)]. The data is transformed
    into the model identification step to make the stationary time series. Once the
    approximate model is developed, parameter estimation is done to reduce the overall
    amount of errors. The model adequacy is then checked with the help of diagnostic
    checking. This ensures that the model’s future predictions fit with the historical
    data. This three-step iterative process is performed multiple times to identify
    the right model fit. The final selected model can then be used for prediction
    purposes [[31](#CR31)].

    the points. The bandwidth of the kernel is a free parameter that has a strong
    influence on the resulting estimate. KDE can be used to visualize the shape of
    some data. The bandwidth affects how smooth the resulting curve is. KDE is calculated
    by weighing the distance of all the data points. Changing the bandwidth changes

    Hyderabad, etc. have a larger crime concentration. Figure [4](#Fig4) shows the
    crime statistics which shows violent crime are the most committed crime across
    India. The concentration of other crimes such as burglary, fraud, kill, murder
    etc. is more concentrated in the cities than other locations. Assault and gambling
    constitute 42% and 38% of the crimes committed in India. Kernel density estimation
    algorithm is used to identify the density of all crimes in India and Bangalore.![../images/507793_1_En_16_Chapter/507793_1_En_16_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/507793_1_En_16_Chapter/507793_1_En_16_Fig3_HTML.png)

    analysis of the crime data from India. It is found that Karnataka, Delhi, and
    Andhra Pradesh are the top states for violent crimes. There are also other crimes
    such as theft, burglary, etc. that are more prevalent in Kerala. The probable
    reason could be due to dense population in these areas. 68 types of crime are
    used such as drunkenness, burglary, theft, assault, fraud, gambling, harassment,
    killing, molestation, suicide, trespass, robbery, warrant, vandalism, murders
    and hurting others, etc. 68 types of crimes classified into 6 classes for ease
    of visualization and Comparative analysis of the shift in criminal activity over
    one year is calculated. It also shows the clustering of various crime types concerning

    the sequence matching like Theft is highest in both graphs and counterfeiting
    is lowest in both figures. As per finding the result the sequence of crimes follows
    Theft, Assault, Cheating, Burglary, Kidnapping and abduction, Robbery, Molestation,
    Narcotic drugs, Riots, Murder, Suicide, Dowry Deaths, Counterfeiting. Sequence

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this research, 1-year crime data has been used under the context of Indian
    and Bangalore crimes. Total 68 types of crime keywords are identified, and they
    are classified into 6 groups. The quality of the input newsfeed data has been
    compared and validated with that of RTI data. KDE is used for density analysis
    and compared with the ARIMA model. Proposed model predicts the possible crimes
    for the time span of 6 h, 1 day, 3 Days, 1 Week, 1 Month to help the crime authority
    take preventive measures well in advance. Our results have shown that the news
    feed data can be used for extracting spatiotemporal information about the prediction
    performance of 68 types of crime. We have achieved a prediction accuracy of 77.49%
    with our crime prediction models. We have validated our crime prediction model
    with that of ARIMA model and found equivalent prediction performance. In the future,
    this work can be extended to topic modeling in text analysis to reduce the false
    acceptance ratio. Additional features such as socio-economic characteristics of
    the population can be included in the news feed analysis. With the help of our
    system, police authorities in Bangalore can deploy their resources effectively.
    This application will result in a reduction of effort and improvement in crime
    response rates.Table 1
