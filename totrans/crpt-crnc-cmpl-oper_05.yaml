- en: When a criminal or group of criminals commit an illegal act that generates substantial
    monetary proceeds it is often difficult for a number of reasons for them to turn
    around and freely spend the ill-gotten funds. A key reason for this would be that
    spending large amounts of capital on expensive purchases such as luxury goods
    either all at once or in smaller amounts for a consistent period of time can attract
    unwanted attention from groups such as law enforcement agencies. As a result,
    criminals attempt to spend this money via methods that will not lead to unnecessary
    attention. ***Money laundering*** refers to the process employed by criminals
    to disguise through a financial transaction the identity, source and destination
    of money that has been illegally obtained.[¹](#FPar1) When are able to freely
    and successfully launder money it allows them to both reap the gains of their
    illegal activities and continue to grow their criminal organizations. These activities
    are not beneficial to society or the global financial system and, therefore, governments
    and legislators around the world have in large part condemned the practice of
    money laundering and have taken efforts to stop it. ***Anti-money laundering***
    (AML), therefore, refers to those laws, regulations and overall efforts to combat
    criminal money laundering.

    On the contrary, the concept dates back as far as ancient China where, in an early
    form of tax evasion, merchants utilized complex financial transactions to hide
    money in fear of confiscation from government entities.[²](#FPar1) The etymology
    of the term “money laundering” itself is thought to have come from the practice
    of US mafia gangsters in the early 1900 such as Al Capone of investing the profits
    from illicit activities, such as selling alcohol during the time of prohibition,
    into legitimate cash-intensive businesses such as laundromats.[³](#FPar1) As the
    crypto space has continued to develop, criminals have unfortunately utilized cryptocurrency
    as a new method by which to conduct illegal financial transactions and then launder
    money from those and other non-crypto-related transactions.

    involved in many aspects of the crypto space. As we noted above, just like in
    the fiat money space, unfortunately there are bad actors who utilize crypto to
    facilitate criminal activity and launder assets. To curb the efforts of these
    criminals, it therefore makes sense to apply similar money laundering regulations
    to the crypto space. Depending on the nature of their specific business activities
    different types of crypto firms may have different obligations under AML regulatory
    frameworks.
  prefs: []

    space (i.e., crypto hedge funds) typically would have AML obligations with regard
    to the underlying investors in their funds as opposed to related to the actual
    nature of their crypto investments. In practice many crypto-asset managers outsource
    these AML and accompany Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance operations to third-party
    service providers such as fund administrators. For reference the role of crypto-asset
    manager administrators is discussed in more detail in Chapter [3](513667_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).

    rigorous AML compliance requirements imposed on other types of crypto-related
    businesses such as crypto exchanges who are potentially responsible for a wide
    variety of evolving AML compliance ranging from ***Customer Due Diligence (CDD)***
    and ***Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)***. In many cases, the laws relating
    to the AML obligations of those individuals and companies that participate in
    the crypto space are still playing catch up to transition from regulating physical
    assets and fiat currencies to a new digital landscape. Even though in many aspects
    crypto AML regulation is under development, there is a long history of traditional
    AML regulation that is being used as a foundation on which to base crypto AML
    compliance and regulatory requirements. It is, therefore, important for those
    involved in the crypto space to develop a strong understanding of money laundering
    fundamentals as well as the historical landscape upon which crypto AML regulations
    are being built upon.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of laundering money can be broken down into three stages. It should
    be noted that these three stages are the general process criminals use to launder
    money and are not specific to either fiat or cryptocurrency specific. Money laundering
    that involves both fiat and cryptocurrencies typically follows these three stages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first stage is called ***placement***. At this stage cash or other assets
    generated from illegal activities, also sometimes referred to as ***dirty money***,
    are circulated from the criminals into the broader financial system. This would
    be in contrast to legally obtained cash, which is referred to as ***clean money***.
    There are a wide variety of schemes that have been employed to facilitate money
    laundering at the placement stage including through the smuggling of physical
    cash or assets across borders, using dirty money to purchase foreign currency,
    taking out loans and repaying them with dirty money and purchasing betting chips
    in casinos with dirty money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second state of the money laundering process is known as ***layering***.
    In this stage, dirty money is attempted to be separated from its original criminal
    source in an attempt to conceal its original criminal source. This stage is called
    layering because the method of concealment is to utilize financial transactions
    to insert additional barriers or layers between the original source and the dirty
    money. These layers make it more difficult for institutions such as law enforcement
    to determine if the money in question is indeed dirty, and if so, what its specific
    criminal origin was. A common way in which layering is carried out is when criminals
    work with third parties such as attorneys to create a company for the sole purpose
    of holding assets to obfuscate the real owner. These companies typically have
    no real employees or undertake any real business. They simply act as empty shells
    to hide the true ***beneficial owner*** of the assets and are therefore referred
    to as ***shell companies***. To be clear the attorney creating the shell company
    on the criminals’ behalf may not be privy to the source of the funds being placed
    into the shell company and, therefore, may not be involved in the criminal scheme
    per se. Furthermore, shell companies themselves are not illegal and are often
    utilized in a variety of legitimate transactions for reasons including tax planning
    and insulating liability in real estate transactions. Other common money laundering
    techniques employed at the layering stage include using dirty money to purchase
    legitimate financial products including insurance policies and stocks, purchasing
    prepaid services with dirty money and then reselling them to unsuspecting purchasers,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third stage of the money laundering process is ***integration***. At this
    stage, the dirty money attempts to further put the dirty money into the financial
    systems. A common way that dirty money is placed into the financial system after
    it has been layered is to invest it into legitimate cash-intensive businesses
    such as Al Capone’s laundromats. When dirty money is combined with legally obtained
    funds in an attempt to disguise the dirty money among the clean money this is
    referred to as a ***commingling of funds*** or ***blending of funds***. One traditional
    example of ways in which criminals launder money at the integration stage is by
    using dirty money that has been previously layered to purchase expensive real
    estate or luxury items such as antique automobiles or valuable artwork with dirty
    money. The use of trade-based financial transactions to launder money by investing
    in items such as real estate or artwork is known as ***trade-based money laundering***.

    different techniques in an attempt to make the money laundering process more difficult
    to detect by law enforcement while simultaneously attempting to launder the most
    amount of money in the quickest period of time without detection. One common example
    of this is a financial transaction known as a ***wash trade***. This is a type
    of fictitious trade where a trader would enter into a transaction or series of
    transactions for the purchase and subsequent sale of the exact same financial
    instrument, such as a stock or Bitcoin, at the exact same price or a very similar
    price when multiple accounts are utilized.[⁴](#FPar1) The goal of wash trading
    is to inflate the price of the financial instrument in question so that the trader
    can later execute a transaction in the financial instrument at a profit based
    on the false appearance of inflated trading volume demand. Money laundering techniques
    employing transactions in the financial markets are referred to as ***market-based
    money laundering***.

    wash trades to launder money was the so-called ***Russian Laundromat scheme***,
    also referred to as the ***Global Laundromat scheme***, that occurred from 2010
    to 2015\. This scheme involved dirty money being placed into the financial system
    through a series of shell companies in Russia. Banks in Latvia and Moldova were
    then utilized to funnel over $20 billion dollars out of Russia.[⁵](#FPar1) As
    part of the scheme Russian individuals with links to the KGB also made purchases
    of financial securities through Deutsche Bank’s Moscow office and then sold them
    through the London office in a wash trade arrangement.[⁶](#FPar1) The laundered

    an epidemic in the Bitcoin markets with goals ranging from manipulating the price
    of Bitcoin to commingling clean and dirty funds to launder money among multiple
    accounts at crypto exchanges.[⁸](#FPar1) Academic research into wash trading in
    cryptocurrency has also supported theories of large-scale wash trading in crypto
    including Bitcoin largely utilized indirect evidence inferred from exchange and
    market activity. It should be clear that this research has suggested that these
    types of wash trading and market manipulation activities are not exclusive to
    Bitcoin and have included the issuance of other cryptocurrencies such as Tether

    that even though virtual currencies and digital assets are different from fiat,
    what FinCEN refers to as so-called, “real currency,” are subject to FinCEN regulations.
    FinCEN’s guidance employs the broad term ***convertible virtual currency (CVC)***
    to include cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. To be clear the FinCEN guidance
    outlines that CVCs are subject to FinCEN regulations in a wide range of contexts

    there is no exemption made for different types of technology utilized to transmit
    value related to CVCs. This effectively means that all blockchains would be covered
    under FinCEN. In casting such as broad regulatory net, FinCEN relies on the above
    referenced definition of money transmission services which outlines that the transmission

    This was later followed up by FATF acknowledging in their June 2021 plenary meeting
    that the majority of jurisdictions have not yet implemented the FATF's requirements,
    including the travel rule and as such it was expected that FATF would continue
    to extend the compliance deadline and work with the crypto sector to promote compliance.[^(61)](#FPar1)

- en: This chapter introduced anti-money laundering (AML) in the cryptocurrency and
    digital asset space. It began by discussing the three stages of money laundering.
    Next, we discussed the role of different market-based money laundering techniques
    criminals employ in crypto including the use of wash trades. The chapter then
    proceeded to discuss the role of the agencies such MONEYVAL and the Financial
    Action Task Force (FATF) including the 5th and 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directives
    (5AMLD and 6AMLD). We then discussed key crypto-related regulatory classifications
    including Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) and Money Service Business (MSB).
    This chapter next proceeded to discuss the role of the Financial Crimes Enforcement
    Network (FinCEN) and the impact on cryptocurrencies and digital asset on proposals
    including the unhosted wallet rule and the Travel Rule. Other topics covered in
    this chapter included the impact of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) on the crypto space
    and its role in combating money laundering. Now that we have developed a foundational
    understanding of the regulatory compliance environment surrounding cryptocurrency
    and digital asset anti-money laundering, in the next chapter we will discuss the
    established an understanding of the fundamentals of the cryptocurrency space in
    the next chapter we will focus on understanding the global regulatory framework
    for cryptocurrencies outside of the AML arena.
