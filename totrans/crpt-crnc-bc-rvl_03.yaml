    In February 2011, the Silk Road Dark Web opened. It offered various illegal goods
    and services, including drugs, stolen identities and passwords, weapons, and sex
    trafficking. It accepted payment in Bitcoin only. At that time, one Bitcoin was
    worth about thirty cents. Critics dismissed Bitcoin as the currency of choice
    for criminals and terrorists, but some investors noticed that Bitcoin’s premise
    was holding true. It allowed strangers—even criminals—to establish trust and conduct
    transactions. In short, Bitcoin was working the way its creators intended.'

    being properly registered with federal agencies. China also cracked down, declaring
    that no financial institution could use cryptocurrencies (although citizens still
    could). The price of Bitcoin rose and fell with these announcements, but the general

    coin, or token, is actually a security, or a tradable financial asset. If a digital
    coin is a security, then it comes under a legal classification that is regulated
    by the US government. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was set
    up after the Wall Street crash of 1929, a historic event that wiped out stockholders
    and ushered in the Great Depression (1929–1942). In practical terms, the SEC is
    charged with ensuring that investors have some transparency into securities markets
    and can better avoid abuse and fraud. If cyrptocurrencies are considered securities,

    the preferential system was starting to resemble the system of intermediaries—banks,

    occurs when two miners solve the proof of work in a blockchain almost simultaneously,

    a fork in the ledger, offering two potential outcomes for the ledger to follow.
    At this point, a consensus mechanism in the community selects the most accurate
    transaction, leaving the other transaction to be ignored. The fork is then resolved.

    rules going forward, while a hard fork expands them. A soft fork is much like
    an upgrade to a piece of software. Just as an upgraded computer can still run
    older versions of software, the blockchain can still work with miners and nodes
    who haven’t upgraded. A soft fork only requires a majority of a blockchain’s users
    to approve. A hard fork, however, is more difficult because it splits the blockchain
    into two incompatible chains, one that follows the old rules and one that follows
    a new set of rules. As a result, a hard fork requires unanimous agreement from
    a blockchain’s users. Otherwise, two different timelines for a blockchain will
    come into existence. In effect, one group will observe one set of rules, while
    the other will obey the other set.
