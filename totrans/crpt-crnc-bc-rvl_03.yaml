- en: 'At first, many people were attracted to Bitcoin for one reason: anonymity.
    In February 2011, the Silk Road Dark Web opened. It offered various illegal goods
    and services, including drugs, stolen identities and passwords, weapons, and sex
    trafficking. It accepted payment in Bitcoin only. At that time, one Bitcoin was
    worth about thirty cents. Critics dismissed Bitcoin as the currency of choice
    for criminals and terrorists, but some investors noticed that Bitcoin’s premise
    was holding true. It allowed strangers—even criminals—to establish trust and conduct
    transactions. In short, Bitcoin was working the way its creators intended.'

  zh: 最初，许多人被比特币吸引，原因很简单：匿名性。2011年2月，丝绸之路暗网市场开业。它提供各种非法商品和服务，包括毒品、被盗身份和密码、武器和性交易。它只接受比特币支付。当时，1个比特币的价值大约是30美分。批评者将比特币视为罪犯和恐怖分子的首选货币，但一些投资者注意到比特币的理念正在得到验证。它允许陌生人——甚至是罪犯——建立信任并进行交易。简而言之，比特币正按照其创造者的意图运行。
- en: This attracted attention, especially as Bitcoin’s price began a series of dramatic
    rises and falls. For speculators, Bitcoin appeared to be an opportunity to make
    a lot of money fast. Law enforcement also began investigations. In the spring
    of 2013, the US government took down the Silk Road Dark Web bazaar and confiscated
    more than 150,000 Bitcoins.

- en: Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, preoccupied government regulators.
    Regulators are charged with enforcing government rules, especially in finance.
    At the time, other tech-based services such as Airbnb and Uber were causing a
    huge disruption in the taxi and hotel industries. Taxi services and hotel companies
    were forced to compete with drivers and apartment owners who, through the internet,
    could connect directly with customers.

  zh: 比特币，以及加密货币 generally，让政府监管机构感到困扰。监管者的任务是执行政府规定，尤其是在金融领域。当时，基于技术的其他服务，如Airbnb和Uber，正在对出租车和酒店行业造成巨大
    disrupt。出租车服务和酒店公司被迫与通过互联网直接与客户连接的司机和公寓所有者竞争。
- en: Regulators wondered if this could also happen to finance. At conferences, they
    asked nervous questions. Are cryptocurrencies a fraud? What impact could they
    have on financial institutions? Could cryptocurrencies break the government monopoly
    on money? US authorities seized cryptocurrency accounts that had traded without
    being properly registered with federal agencies. China also cracked down, declaring
    that no financial institution could use cryptocurrencies (although citizens still
    could). The price of Bitcoin rose and fell with these announcements, but the general
    trend was higher. At the start of 2014, the value of Bitcoin shot up from about
    $13 to $770 per coin.

    for “Bitcoin” exceeded searches for “gold.” This was true for countries where
    confidence in the central government was low, such as Algeria, Colombia, and Venezuela.
    In 2019 interest in Bitcoin was especially high in Nigeria and South Africa, both
    of which had experienced currency devaluations. Citizens of these countries were
    also very uncertain about their governments, especially the prospects for economic
    reforms.

  zh: 谷歌报告称，“如何购买比特币”在2017年是第三大“如何做”的搜索（最高搜索是“如何制作泥巴”）。在一些国家，对“比特币”的谷歌搜索超过了“黄金”的搜索。这些国家包括阿尔及利亚、哥伦比亚和委内瑞拉，这些国家对中央政府的信心较低。2019年，尼日利亚和南非对比特币的兴趣尤其高，这两个国家都经历了货币贬值。这些国家的公民对他们政府，尤其是经济改革的前景也非常不确定。

- en: As Bitcoin transactions became more frequent, they also became more expensive.
    Bitcoin transactions were hardwired to be limited to one megabyte. Because of
    this small size, the blockchain network only processed seven transactions per
    second. By comparison, credit card companies can handle more than fifty thousand
    transactions per second. As more and more Bitcoin transactions were processed,
    the network became clogged.

  zh: 随着比特币交易的日益频繁，交易成本也在上升。比特币交易被设定为最多限制在一个兆字节内。由于这个较小的尺寸，区块链网络只能每秒处理七笔交易。相比之下，信用卡公司每秒可以处理超过五万笔交易。随着越来越多的比特币交易被处理，网络变得拥堵。
- en: Some users offered miners higher fees to include their transaction in a block.
    By 2017 users were paying miners an average of five dollars per transaction. This
    made small transactions prohibitively expensive—buyers of movie tickets or a cup
    of coffee would have to pay five dollars extra. Worse, to blockchain supporters,
    the preferential system was starting to resemble the system of intermediaries—banks,
    agencies, and so on—that blockchain was trying to replace. Users who wanted to
    pay cheaper fees found they had to wait hours, or even days, to have their transactions
    processed.

  zh: 一些用户向矿工提供更高的费用，以将他们的交易包含在一个区块中。到2017年，用户每笔交易向矿工支付的平均费用为五美元。这使得小额交易变得非常昂贵——电影票或一杯咖啡的买家将不得不额外支付五美元。更糟糕的是，对于区块链的支持者来说，这种优先制度开始类似于区块链试图取代的系统——银行、机构等中介。希望支付较低费用的用户发现他们必须等待数小时，甚至数天，才能处理他们的交易。
- en: An obvious solution was to make the transaction sizes larger, but miners protested
    that these would cost more to process. If costs rose, fewer miners would participate,
    potentially making the system more vulnerable to manipulation. One side wanted

- en: The debate grew acrimonious. One group proposed a “fork” to Bitcoin. A fork
    occurs when two miners solve the proof of work in a blockchain almost simultaneously,
    resulting in a discrepancy in the ledger. In effect, the two transactions present
    a fork in the ledger, offering two potential outcomes for the ledger to follow.
    At this point, a consensus mechanism in the community selects the most accurate
    transaction, leaving the other transaction to be ignored. The fork is then resolved.

  zh: 辩论变得激烈。一组人提议对比特币进行“分叉”。当两个矿工在区块链中几乎同时解决工作量证明时，就会发生分叉，导致账本出现差异。实际上，这两个交易在账本中呈现分叉，为账本提供了两种可能的结局。在此时，社区中的共识机制选择最准确的交易，使其他交易被忽略。分叉随后得到解决。
- en: Forks, however, can allow the community of miners and nodes to effectively change
    the rules of the blockchain. The challenge is to get the blockchain community
    to agree to the change. After all, there is no centralized decision-making body
    that can simply order everyone to obey its decrees. Rather, the community has
    to come to a consensus.

  zh: 然而，分叉可以让矿工和节点社区有效地改变区块链的规则。挑战在于让区块链社区同意这种改变。毕竟，没有集中的决策机构可以简单地命令每个人都遵守其法令。相反，社区必须达成共识。
- en: Forks can be either soft or hard. In simple terms, a soft fork limits a blockchain’s
    rules going forward, while a hard fork expands them. A soft fork is much like
    an upgrade to a piece of software. Just as an upgraded computer can still run
    older versions of software, the blockchain can still work with miners and nodes
    who haven’t upgraded. A soft fork only requires a majority of a blockchain’s users
    to approve. A hard fork, however, is more difficult because it splits the blockchain
    into two incompatible chains, one that follows the old rules and one that follows
    a new set of rules. As a result, a hard fork requires unanimous agreement from
    a blockchain’s users. Otherwise, two different timelines for a blockchain will
    come into existence. In effect, one group will observe one set of rules, while
    the other will obey the other set.

  zh: 分叉可以是软分叉或硬分叉。简单来说，软分叉限制了区块链未来的规则，而硬分叉扩展了它们。软分叉很像是对软件的一次升级。就像升级后的电脑仍然可以运行旧版本的软件一样，区块链仍然可以与尚未升级的矿工和节点协同工作。软分叉只需要区块链用户中的大多数批准。然而，硬分叉更为复杂，因为它将区块链分成两条不兼容的链，一条遵循旧规则，另一条遵循新规则。因此，硬分叉需要区块链用户的全体一致同意。否则，区块链将存在两条不同的时间线。实际上，一组将遵守一套规则，而另一组将遵守另一套规则。

- en: One software developer proposed a soft fork to the Bitcoin blockchain that would
    make it more efficient to process more content, effectively doubling its capacity.
    The fork would also allow Bitcoin to be used on a new network called Lightning.
    The Lightning Network allowed users to sign contracts that enabled them to use
    two-payment channels according to a preestablished balance. More important, the
    system allowed users to transfer funds to third parties without the need for miners.
    Thus, Lightning could allow any number of transactions without miners’ fees.

  zh: 一位软件开发者向比特币区块链提出了一次软分叉，使其能更有效地处理更多内容，实际上将它的容量翻了一番。这次分叉还将使比特币能够在一个名为闪电网络的新网络上使用。闪电网络允许用户签署合同，根据预先设定的余额使用双支付通道。更重要的是，该系统允许用户无需矿工即可向第三方转账。因此，闪电网络可以进行大量无需矿工费的交易。
- en: The Bitcoin community considered this solution. Some miners strongly opposed
    it, with one group in China leading the resistance. They didn’t want to lose their
    fees. Others thought that Lightning transactions, which are harder to trace than
    those on the blockchain, would draw a crackdown from the Chinese government. The
    Chinese government opposed any transaction it couldn’t monitor.
