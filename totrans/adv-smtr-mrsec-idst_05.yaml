- en: Considering the conditions that we are living in since 2020 and the cases of
    death caused by covid, all the researchers of the world have participated in defending
    humanity from this epidemic. Like all these people, the author has thought about
    what she cannot reduce but to specify the number of cases in an environment thanks
    to this project called “SARS-COV-2 watch,” and this measures the temperature of
    the owner and also informs him in the case of someone close to him at a distance
    less than one meter who is infected. The proposed SARS-COV-2 watch design consists
    of a case to place all components, a metal cap to conduct heat into the main temperature
    sensor, an LCD screen to display the temperature data, and a button to activate
    the temperature conversion and display it on the LCD screen. In order to inform
    the watch wearer that there is someone around him with high temperature, the author
    integrated a vibrating module. This small vibrating motor is ideal for projects
    with haptic feedback.

- en: The Covid-19 crisis has upended our healthcare systems and forced most states
    to rethink how they operate. Faced with saturated hospitals and emergency departments
    in the midst of the health crisis, telemedicine has seen a sudden interest and
    small success (Chakkarwar, & Tamane, 2020; Mnaoui, Najoua, & Ouajji, 2020). Indeed,
    several months before the health crisis and the containment measures, consultations
    via telemedicine, i.e. an appointment with a doctor by videoconference, represented
    a very marginal percentage of medical consultations. Patients preferred to travel
    to their doctor's office even though remote medical consultations are reimbursed
    by the Health Insurance (Chen, 2021; Harris, 2020). However, the health crisis
    has completely changed the situation. Indeed, the containment measures, the recommendations
    of social distancing and the overloaded hospitals encouraged the French to resort
    more and more to remote consultations to prevent the risks of contamination, to
    allow to target more quickly the patients “at risk” and to avoid the faster circulation
    of the virus. (Crisostomo, Balida, & Gustilo, 2020) Connected health devices such
    as watches, thermometers or glucose meters are not the only levers of action for
    connected medicine (Garg, & Dave, 2019; Hindrayani, Fakhruddin, Prismahardi Aji,
    & Safitri, 2020). In fact, some more infected countries have implemented additional
    technologies to help health services and patients fight the Coronavirus pandemic.
    For example, the city of Wuhan, the first Covid-19 cluster, has implemented connected
    robots to distribute medicines to infected patients, helping to limit the circulation
    of the virus in the territory (Gawade, & Joshi, 2020; Hameed, 2021; Muladi, et
    al., 2020).

    improve patient management, monitoring and treatment of diseases (Gupta & Johari,
    2019; Khant, & Patel 2021; Qjidaa, et al. 2020). The Internet of Things (IOT)
    is one of the most used technologies to solve the problem of distance between
    people existing in the same place (Miladinovic, & Schefer-Wenzl, 2018; Rahim,
    & Iqbal, 2020).

- en: The IoT network is used to provide an object with connectivity to the Internet
    to allow the feedback of information. Different communication protocols are available
    on the market to do this. Not all of them have the same characteristics. For companies
    that are getting into IoT, choosing the most suitable communication network for
    their uses can thus become a Chinese puzzle. They have to take into account the
    network coverage, the battery life of the objects, the communication distance
    or the service cost. Connected objects allow for real-time and on-demand tracking
    and identification of tools, equipment and medications. Being able to have instant
    information about a patient can often be decisive. IOT applications allow the
    user to interact with others to maintain and build relationships. For example,
    connected objects could automatically trigger messages to our friends to let them
    know what we are doing and where we are. There are also some IOT systems allowing
    an operator or a user to report a malfunction. If it is interesting at the end
    of an airport service to ask a user his level of satisfaction, it is even more
    useful for the improvement of the service, to allow to signal a lack of soap,
    paper, or a problem of smell (Saini, 2019; Saini, Agarwal, Varshney, & Gupta,
    2018; Soumya, Shanmugam, Saini, & Kumar, 2020; Kumari, & Saini, 2021).

    information and measurements or to execute orders (Thepade, & Jadhav, 2020; Yadav,
    & Vishwakarma, 2019). Based on existing connected systems, the researchers in
    the technology field noticed that sensors in connected watches could potentially
    reveal coronavirus contamination even before the first symptoms of Covid-19 are
    reported (Thepade, Chaudhari, Dindorkar, & Bang, 2020). It is largely the temperature
    sensor that indicates whether a rise in temperature is significant enough to indicate
    the presence of the virus (Varun, & Nagaraj, 2021; Vishwakarma, Upadhyaya, Kumari,
    & Mishra, 2019). For the proposed watch, I used a temperature sensor to measure
    the temperature of its wearer, a GPS module to detect high temperature people
    around the target, and a vibrator module to alert the target of a high temperature
    person near him.

    the arduino Mega 2560 card measures about 10.2 x 5.3 cm, which is about 6 x the
    size of the Micro. Somewhere in between these two extremes, you will find the
    Uno and its dimensions of 6.9 x 5.3 cm. The price of the Micro is usually around

    sensor that gives 1 degree Celsius at each 10 mVolt change. This sensor can detect
    a temperature up to 150 degrees Celsius. The first digital pin of the lm35 sensor
    is Vcc, the second is the output and the third is the ground. The LM35 is the
    simplest temperature sensor and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller
    (Nasution, & Harahap, 2020; Liu, Ren, Zhang, & Lv, 2011). The LM35 sensor datasheet
    summary is displayed in Figure 6.

    gives a temperature of 1 degree for every 10 mV change at its output pin. You
    can easily check this with a voltmeter by connecting Vcc to pin 1 and ground to
    pin 3 and the output voltage to pin 2 of the LM35 sensor. For example, if the
    output voltage of the LM35 sensor is 250 m volts, it means that the temperature
    is about 25 degrees Celsius. The Connection of the LM35 temperature sensor with
    the Arduino uno card is shown in Figure 7.

    disc, it will be easy to use and to embark. Two wedges allow to feed it and to
    manage the power of the vibration (blue for the negative and red for the positive).
    It works between 2V and 5V, the higher the voltage, the stronger the vibration
    will be. If you want to decrease the current to drive it directly with an Arduino
    pin, you can put in series a resistor from 100 ohm to 1 kOhm, but it is rather
    advisable to use a transistor. The Vibrating module is presented in Figure 14.
