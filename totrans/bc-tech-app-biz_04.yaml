- en: This chapter identifies the existing challenges in the winery industry and proposes
    to analyze their resolution by the adoption of blockchain technology. Blockchain
    allows the traceability of the whole process linked to wine production, from the
    cultivation of the grapes to the distribution of the bottles. Blockchain allows
    winery firms to unlock the potential value existing in some processes, especially
    when they create a competitive advantage. The chapter investigates these concepts
    within the case of Cantina Volpone, which has been the first case in Italy to
    adopt blockchain technology in the winery industry. This chapter studies the implementation
    path for blockchain technology in the winery industry and highlights the operational
    and financial challenges emerging from its adoption.

    traceability. In Italy, in the wine sector, companies are able to transmit the
    main values of their product (territory, method, and professionalism) to the end
    customers with great difficulty. These values are the main guarantors of the quality
    and authenticity of the products. There are companies abroad that cannot guarantee
    the quality of Italian products and tend to deceive consumers with the “Italian
    sounding”. The annual losses due to the phenomenon of counterfeiting in the wine
    sector are estimated at about 2 billion euros per year, a loss that can adversely
    affect the economy of this country.

    used, and the quality of the methods used to cultivate the food destined to reach
    their tables. Based on a survey, 71% of consumers are willing to pay a higher
    price if the information related to quality, transparency, and provenance is provided,
    60% of consumers check the label for sustainability, 74% of consumers are influenced
    by transparency and traceability and 89% would like to know the criteria for a
    certification of origin (E&Y Report, 2019).

    suffers from data fragmentation and centralized controls which proves vulnerable
    to both data modification and management. In the event of contamination, identifying
    the source and isolating the product swiftly from the supply chain requires close
    coordination among multiple stakeholders in the agricultural supply chain (Storoy
    et al., 2013). These technologies cannot guarantee with certainty to consumers
    that the information presented is true and has not been altered. Specifically,
    in the food sector, it is harder to know where the products came from and where
    they are as they make their way into a vast network of physical or digital distribution
    channels involving multiple actors. The solution to address the food safety and
    quality concerns is to improve traceability, transparency, security, durability,
    and integrity (Feng et al., 2019; Tsang et al., 2018; Helo and Hao, 2019; Banerjee
    et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017). Blockchain has been widely accepted as a solution
    to the underlying trust and security issues in information transparency and prevention
    of tampering with (Ølnes et al., 2017). The contribution that Blockchain could
    make is very large in traceability; in fact, Blockchain is an innovative application
    of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption
    algorithm, and other information technologies.

    that enables the tracking and tracing of finished goods and materials, providing
    users with a high level of trust that the data they view is correct and has not
    been altered by an unauthorized party. Blockchain-based traceability allows the
    creation of a form of identification and enhancement of products offered in the
    form of virtual KM-zero. The solution gives the possibility to increase a digital
    certified information relationship between the producer (wherever he is) and the
    final consumer (wherever he is).

    that allows identifying the producer through the digital signature. Moreover,
    information about the entire cultivation process, the methodologies used for the
    production and transformation of the wine are provided by the producer and other
    operators in the supply chain. Consumers can obtain this information by scanning
    the QR Code on the label of the bottle. The Blockchain allows fixing an indelible
    and secure photograph of all those steps, creating and strengthening the relationship
    of trust between the producer and the final consumer.

- en: Blockchain is defined as a digital, decentralized, and distributed register,
    in which each transaction is recorded and added in chronological order, with the
    aim of creating permanent and non-alterable evidence and traces. In different
    words, blockchain can be defined as a new type of data system that records and
    stores data allowing multiple stakeholders to share in a confidential manner,
    and to access the same data and information in the future (Horst Treiblmaier,
    2018). The first block in the chain is called “genesis block” because it has no
    “relatives” (previous blocks), while each block that is added to the chain refers
    and connects to the previous one, called “parent block”, through a hash value.
    Given the continuous addition of blocks, the size of this chain is bound to grow
    over time because each new set of information corresponds to a block. This chain,
    however, has an immutable nature and when its content is once written, it is no
    longer modifiable or eliminable, unless the entire structure which is guaranteed
    by the use of cryptographic primitives, can be invalidated. In summary, the Blockchain
    can be defined as an ordered, incremental, solid, digital chain of cryptographically
    linked blocks (De Giovanni, 2020a).

    the actors can operate independently, but only one or more pre-selected actors
    perform the function of validators in the network, in the public ones, each member
    of the network can contribute to the updating of data on the ledger and have all
    the unchangeable copies of all operations approved by consent.

    and public health issues, companies have invested significantly in order to seek
    new alternative tools to increase transparency, consumer confidence in the products
    they buy, and accountability in all supply chains. In the agri-food sector, companies
    are looking for a solution that can be easily integrated into their supply chains
    and solve their problems related to transparency and reliability (De Giovanni,
    2020b). In order to fully understand blockchain-based traceability, it is important
    to give a brief explanation of what traceability and blockchain really are.

    its customers, and “tracking” as the integration of the focal firm and its suppliers.
    Jansen-Vullers et al. (2003) use both an up and downstream approach to integration
    to define the two concepts in relation to traceability. The difference between
    “track-and-trace” and traceability is that traceability includes the ability to
    point out the position of an item in real-time (Duhaylongsod and De Giovanni,
    2019; Preeker and De Giovanni, 2019).

    (Zhang and Batt, 2014). Internal traceability refers to the processes that individual
    firms use which link the identities of the products that enter the firm’s operations
    and the products that leave its operations. Individual firms will also generate
    and store additional data reflecting changes that occur during the processing
    and transformational processes, which is added to product identification. External
    traceability refers to the ability of firms in a value chain to communicate information
    about products from some or all stages of transformation to some or all parties
    in the value chain. Firms generally assign a unique product identifier and adopt
    some method for its communication (Zhang and Batt, 2014).

    supply chain have examined the applicability of blockchain technology in the traceability
    sector (Roberto Casado-Vara, 2018). The blockchain, thanks to its intrinsic characteristics
    and structure, offers the possibility to face one of the most difficult challenges
    of agri-food companies, the total and reliable registration of information and
    data related to the food. Indeed, instead of storing data in an opaque network
    system, with the blockchain, all the information of the food products can be stored
    in a shared and transparent system for all the members along the supply chain
    (Tian,2017).

    imperfect. Traceability systems have repeatedly betrayed consumers, companies,
    and European and international institutions in various ways in recent years, and
    there has been a need to implement more transparent and sustainable solutions
    in this sector. Databases are highly vulnerable to inaccuracies and hacking systems,
    as well as intentional defects caused by corruption and fraudulent behavior.

    to solve frequent food safety incidents (Aung, M.M.; Chang, 2014). For example,
    RFID technology can be used for data acquisition of raw material procurement,
    production processing, warehousing management, logistics, and transportation (Zhang,
    2019). However, traditional models using RFID technology have problems such as
    low efficiency. As an instance, the centralized storage of data increases the
    possibility of information loss and tampering. The tools and techniques used for
    the product’s traceability, before the implementation of blockchain, was characterized
    by a centralized organization that can be a vulnerable target for bribery. Another
    potential risk of the centralized system is that it becomes a single point of
    failure (Tian, 2017).

- en: Blockchain-based traceability could solve several problems that the original
    traceability was not able to overcome. The most important issue of traceability
    is related to the coordination of transaction activities. Blockchain technology
    uses distributed digital databases where the blocks are linked together in a linear
    way and cannot be tampered with. The second issue is the difficulty of connecting
    physical flows to information flows. Blockchain technology can be easily linked
    to sensors, IoT platforms, and readable electronic tags such as RFID and barcode.

- en: Blockchain-based traceability provides targeted and accurate information regarding
    a specific product to the customers and it enables the customers to reach crucial
    information related to food safety and quality (De Giovanni, 2020c). Thus, customers
    with food’s traceability feel more confident and they will be willing to pay a
    higher price for those products, which guarantee information on high quality and
    desired origin (De Giovanni and Zaccour, 2019). Consequently, companies that can
    provide such effective traceability systems for their products not only increase
    safety precautions in operations but also enhance customers' confidence and trust
    through the assurance of quality and safety (Shanahan et al., 2009, Mai et al.,
    2010).

    a supplier or an operator with responsibility for a product safety problem by
    providing well-documented traceable data to prove that they comply with regulatory
    requirements and do not present risks (Meuwissen et al., 2003; Sahin et al., 2007;
    Fritz and Schiefer, 2009). In that condition, liability claims and lawsuits will
    be avoided and the company's image will not be affected (Mai et al., 2010; De
    Giovanni and Ramani, 2017). Blockchain-based Traceability can support product
    claims and in general, it provides product information that everyone can rely
    on and it is a perfect strategy for the brand’s protection, complementing both
    quality and goodwill (Buratto et al., 2019).

    of adopting this technology is the speed of tracing every single product’s information.
    Based on a survey, Walmart wanted to trace the origin of mangoes in one of its
    shops. Using traditional linear methods to trace a package from the orchards in
    Ecuador to the Los Angeles supermarket took six days, 18 hours, and 26 minutes.
    The time taken to complete and submit all the information using the blockchain
    was only 2.2 seconds. In case of food contamination, six days is an eternity!
    The blockchain also allows specific batches to be identified at any time without
    food waste. Contaminated or counterfeit products can be traced quickly, while
    safe goods would remain on shelves instead of ending up in landfills (Kamath,2018).

    and tracing of finished goods and materials, providing users with a high level

- en: Several studies have been carried out on the blockchain as a solution to the
    problems of traceability and, although in some projects excellent results have
    been recorded (IBM Food Trust, Walmart, E&Y blockchain Hub), the blockchain remains
    a “new” technology with a high level of risk (De Giovanni, 2019a). Even if Blockchain
    technology looks like an important innovation for food traceability, there are
    some limits that have to be analyzed. The Global Food Traceability Centre has
    identified six different challenges that it is important to overcome in order
    to use blockchain-based traceability successfully. The first challenge is related
    to consumers' preferences, which change over time, and their confidence, which
    tends to be increasingly fragile. The Centre also identified the disorder created
    by national regulators, who are often at odds with each other on the issue of
    traceability. The third challenge concerns the possible difficulty in data analysis
    because there are not unifying requirements. The fourth challenge, on the other
    hand, is to explain the complex difference between the various food sectors. Later
    the Centre pointed out that neither traceability nor blockchain could not prevent
    human errors in the recording of information. Finally, the last challenge is represented
    by the weak technical systems that do not allow fast and effective response times.
    Overcoming these challenges will not be easy and will depend mainly on companies'
    willingness to be open to change and invest in innovation (GS1, 2012).

    system as a user which can provide credentials and a unique identity to the members.
    After registration, public and private cryptographic key pairs will be generated
    for each user. The public key can be used to identify the user within the system
    and the private key can be used to authenticate the user when interacting with
    the system. This enables each product can be digitally addressed by the users
    when being updated, added, or exchanged to the next user in the downstream position
    of the supply chain. In food supply chains, when a user who is in a particular
    link receives a product, he can add new data into the profile of the product only
    with its private key. In addition, when the user transfers this product to the
    next user, both of them have to sign a digital contract to authenticate the exchange
    (Tian, 2017).

    of the time it depends on the type of the crops. These processes are indicated

    and data during the product’s production phase (De Giovanni, 2021a). A smart contract
    is a program that runs itself when certain predetermined conditions are met. In
    addition to this, specific smart contracts will be able to automate various expensive
    or complicated operations. Through the smart contracts, used on Ethereum or Hyperladger,
    every action performed along the Food supply chain is recorded in the Blockchain,
    which is responsible for storing all data uploaded by the participants in the
    supply chain in an immutable way. The information recorded during each session
    must be validated by business partners, forming a consensus of all participants.
    After each block is validated, it is added to the transition chain becoming permanent
    and unchangeable. With the blockchain and smart contract introduction, the traceability
    process will be divided into blocks.

    (Tiscini, 2020). However, being a very early adopter, the company had to address
    some problems linked to the limited knowledge of this new technology and the resulting
    employee training costs.

    it is important to move on to the analysis of the phases and individual activities
    that made up the project. In total, four different macro phases can be distinguished
    (E&Y,2019) including Assessment, Data Collection, Development, and Communication
    which are indicated in figure 5.

    define the result to be reached and how to achieve it. The assessment phase lasted
    about two months and they defined their final objective as the perfect recording
    of all the information contained in the entire life cycle of Cantina Placido-Volpone''s
    Falanghina wine. In other words, the final objective was the recording of all
    sensitive data in the blockchain, guaranteeing the security and immutability of
    the data. The secondary objective included environmental sustainability, anti-counterfeiting,
    and the internationalization of the company. Analyzing precisely the first phase,
    the actions that have been carried out are as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The actions which are mentioned in figure 5 were carried out through numerous
    interviews between E&Y officials and employees and managers of the Placido-Volpone
    winery, where the two parties treated the project in detail without omitting any
    data. During the interviews it was therefore decided to analyze all the phases
    of the process, from the cultivation of the soil to the marketing of the bottles,
    leaving out only the “after-sale” process. Tracing the entire production process
    of the wine was possible because the Placido-Volpone winery does not rely on third-party
    companies for any process but all phases of cultivation are “in-house”; this allowed
    the two companies to have at their disposal all the data needed to complete the
    project.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second phase of the project is data collection, a phase in which useful
    information for the product traceability process is collected. The entire data
    collection process was manual because the Apulian company had not invested in
    new technologies or digitization before, but all the information was taken manually
    on paper notebooks. Therefore, the crucial point of this phase was the beginning
    of the collaboration between E&Y and Cantina Placido-Volpone with EzLab. Indeed,
    in order to speed up data recording and to give an innovative boost to the company,
    AgriOpenData was introduced, an online platform developed by EzLab for the optimization
    of business management and the recording of information on the Data Management
    System. This software represented an innovation for the company, being able to
    support agronomists in crop treatment processes, through the use of OpenData,
    which are directly integrated with the information processed during field activities.
    This allowed the company's employees to exchange and share data and information
    continuously and quickly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another advantage of the AgriOpenData software was the replacement of the old
    paper campaign notebook with a digital one. The campaign notebook is obligatory
    by law for all farms in Italy, until a few years ago it had to be presented once
    a year, but with the new provisions, it has to be presented once a month. With
    a digital notebook, writing the campaign notebook becomes much faster, safer,
    and more reliable because there is no possibility to lose some data or information.

    and implementation of the Smart Contract that is the basis of Ethereum. During
    the process, the managers of Cantina Placido-Volpone had to choose which information
    to trace in clear text on the blockchain and which to hide through encryption.
    Although transparency is one of the main objectives of the project, some information
    had to be hidden because it was strategically important.'

    the end consumer can reach by scanning the QR Code on the label on the back of
    the bottle. The design of the Landing Page was conducted by NeriWolff, a company
    belonging to E&Y. The Landing Page as is shown in figure 7 contains all the useful
    information for the consumer such as the geographical context, the cultivation,
    the winemaking process, the distribution, and the sale. For each of these areas,
    the customer has the possibility to consult all the information recorded in the
    blockchain. In fact, it is necessary for the customer to click on “verification
    of interventions” to be taken to another web page where all the information relating
    to that specific area of interest is recorded chronologically. Moreover, for each
    piece of information (e.g. pruning or grape harvest) it is possible to click on
    “Certificate register” to be traced back to another Etherscan web page, which
    represents the Ethereum search engine. By reading the information contained on
    the Etherscan page the customer can see that all the information has been recorded
    immutably in the blockchain.

    of products has led to numerous economic benefits. Although Cantina Placido-Volpone
    initially had to spend a large amount of money to implement this new traceability
    system, this innovation had a positive impact on the company's balance sheet and
    the main profitability indicators. This analysis was carried out by analyzing
    Cantina Volpone's balance sheet for 2017 and through interviews with the winery
    owners.
  prefs: []

    €, divided into an up-front fee of 30.000 € at the beginning of the project and
    10.000€ at the middle of the project. In addition to the fixed costs, the winery
    had to incur variable costs equal to € 0.10 for each bottle traced. In this case,
    the variable costs amounted to 13.000 €, having E&Y and Volpone traced 130.000
    bottles. Therefore, in 2017 the total costs amounted to 53.000 €.

    decided to re-brand its bottles, primarily to achieve the canons of beauty that
    the winery wanted to target and also to justify the premium price applied to the
    bottles traced. In fact, from 2017, the Falanghina of Cantina Placido-Volpone
    went from a price of 7 € to 9.20 €, recording a premium price of 2.20 €. According
    to some analyses carried out by Cantina Placido-Volpone staff, 80% of the premium
    price was due to rebranding and 20% to the investment made with E&Y. In fact,
    as one of the Volpone''s manager said: “the 20% of premium price allows to neutralize
    the increase in value due to rebranding with a high level of certainty”. In this
    way, knowing that the 20% of the premium price is 0.44€, multiplying the latter
    by the number of bottles traced, the benefit of the solution is outlined, which
    amounted to 57.200€. As a result, in 2016 there was an increase in the cost of
    bottle production, costs increased by 31.42% and had a significant impact on the
    company''s profits. Production costs thus rose to 100.000 €, but as a result,
    the blockchain has managed, through its own features, to create additional cost
    advantages such as:'

    of the blockchain. Now, it is possible to calculate the ROI of the project, comparing
    the total margin to the cost of the solution (7.700/53.000), which equals 14.53%.

    may seem exorbitant, it had a positive effect on the company's profitability,
    leading to a higher than average market ROI and significant cost advantages. These
    results are due to the transparency that the Placido Volpone Winery has offered

    codes were made by European consumers including Germany (6.30%) and the United
    Kingdom (5.90%). Moreover, it is very useful to point out that the second place
    in this ranking is occupied by the United States (with 11.70%), whose wine consumers
    are very sensitive to information about the origin and originality of the product.
    This shows that through the introduction of Blockchain in its traceability system,
    Cantina Placido-Volpone is achieving one of the goals set at the beginning of
    the project, the internationalization of its products. Analyzing the views in

    received most of the visits to its website from consumers living in Rome, Milan,
    and other cities in northern Italy. This is a very important result because two
    of the main objectives after the rebranding were to attract a clientele more interested
    in the quality of wine and to expand its sales in the major Italian cities. Figure
