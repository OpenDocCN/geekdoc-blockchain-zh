    digital and permanent recording of transactions on a ledger, such that the ledger
    is distributed across a network of computers (nodes). This makes the ledger available
    across all the nodes simultaneously, thus ensuring that the information contained
    within the ledger remains unaltered. Blockchain can further be explained via its
    terms: in a simplified form, a “block” is a bundle of information regarding a
    transaction, while a “chain” is the continuous record of various blocks of information,
    hence, creating a ledger that is sustained through the use of mathematical algorithms
    to verify the information to be added to the existing blocks of information in
    a way that ensures the permanence of the block in the chain.'

- en: Blockchain’s trustworthy status is complemented by the fact that there are existing
    replicas of the blockchain ledger on various nodes. This ensures that the disconnection
    of a node does not affect the access to the record by other users on the blockchain
    network. Every block in the chain references the preceding block, and this eliminates
    manipulation of the records on the blockchain (Lemieux et al., [2019](#CR15)).
    Blockchains also utilize cryptography in attaining an increased degree of trustworthiness
    of the information in the block. Cryptography  is utilized in uniquely marking
    a transaction consummated on a blockchain system (Zheng et al., [2018](#CR29)).
    It facilitates the immutable linking of various blocks on the chain by combining
    different blocks to create a block hash.^([1](#Fn1))

    of these blockchain systems exhibits, in different ways, the properties of the
    original conceptualization of blockchain. These changes are usually to accommodate
    application-specific requirements and security concerns around the use of blockchain
    technology. The different blockchain systems are usually distinguished along the
    lines of the level of ownership, access, and operation of the blockchain (Zheng
    et al., [2018](#CR29)). Blockchains can be private or permissioned, public or
    permission-less or consortium blockchain systems.

    the blockchain are controlled by an organization. Essentially, access to the blockchain
    network is controlled by that organization. This is usually the case for companies
    or organizations that adopt a blockchain for internal processes. Some authors
    believe that permissioned blockchain systems are built for specific purposes.
    However, permissioned blockchain system poses certain concerns when considered
    against the general conceptualization of blockchain, which is against any affiliation
    to centralization or a singular verifying authority. It also undermines, to a
    great degree, the immutability of the record on the blockchain as it requires
    less manpower and technical requirements for the blockchain to be manipulated
    (Lemieux et al., [2019](#CR15)).

    owned by a consortium or group of organizations. Like private or permissioned
    blockchains, the same concerns exist in a slightly less worrying degree. Public

    of information by any user on the blockchain without the need to obtain permission
    from a central authority, as is the case with private blockchain or consortium

    as originally conceptualized, which refers to a distributed store of information
    that secures records without the necessity for intermediaries or oversight authorities.
    They consider that private blockchains  undermine the original point of blockchain,
    which essentially serves the purpose of removing third parties. Since private
    blockchains, though cheaper, require the need for a centralized authority that
    determines the users with access to verification capacity, it adds minimal value
    to the concept of a trusted integrated database (Jabbari & Kamisky, [2018](#CR11)).

    of blockchain remain trust, immutability and transparency, disintermediation,
    and substantial cost savings. The addition of new information to the existing
    database of information on a blockchain network where users are allowed to approve
    or verify the truthfulness of a transaction upon receipt of sufficient cryptographic
    proof that the information contained in the inputted data is accurate enhances
    trust, and this invariably makes blockchain a superior and preferred means of
    data storage and recording. The attractiveness of blockchain is doubled when the
    immutability and transparency of the stored records are considered.

    data in a manner that guarantees permanence without a possibility of alteration
    except through an agreement of the users with adequate technical capacity and
    cost that may not be readily available, assures parties and users of transparency.
    Any user on the blockchain can audit the records as they are available to every
    user without the need to go through an intermediary authority (Zheng et al., [2018](#CR29)).

    an intermediary. The removal of an intermediary would eliminate all cost impositions

    it appears that the decentralized nature of blockchain and the lack of intermediaries
    (which have become standardized and commonplace in our modern financial and business
    transactions), though exciting and innovating, also carry a large amount of risk.
    Indeed, one wonders whether it is even really possible for it to be truly said
    that there are no “intermediaries” with blockchain-based technologies. Take Bitcoin,
    for instance, which is a continuously growing and exciting digital currency centered
    on blockchain technology. Bitcoin owners tend to use Bitcoin wallets, which are
    often hosted on private company platforms. Are these private company hosts of
    Bitcoin not considered intermediaries? And are they not subject to manipulation?

    Ledger, a private company Bitcoin wallet host based in France, was subjected to
    a major hacking incident, which led to the personal information of over 270,000
    users being leaked online. Bambrough refers to these intermediary companies as
    Bitcoin’s “biggest weakness”, and the same may hold for other forms of assets
    or technologies based on blockchain (Bambrough, 2020).

    relating specifically to its application in the legal sector. There is the concern
    that smart contracts (which will be discussed later in this chapter in detail)
    are incapable of capturing the finer legal concepts of reasonability and best
    endeavors requirement in execution, and this is without mentioning the obvious
    fact that traditional contracts can easily accommodate amendments to contracts,
    which would readily not be the case with smart contracts that run on codes, which
    make no provision for such amendments (Brown, [2016](#CR4)). While the application
    of blockchain in legal endeavors will occasion some benefits, it cannot wholly
    replace existing legal systems. Werbach suggests that blockchain can be synchronized
    with the law through contractual integration, the application of computational
    court and on-chain governance. In essence, he believes this approach would serve
    the legal environment better than either a left-wing liberal approach to blockchain
    or a right-wing approach to preserving existing legal regimes.

    engendering greater efficiency for both state and individual actors whose reliance
    on the conventional legal process to enforce their transaction will cease when
    blockchain technology is applied. Notwithstanding, Yeung recognizes the limitations
    of technological enforcement of contracts, which precludes individuals from challenging
    an alleged rule violation, thereby eroding the attendant opportunity for the society
    to reaffirm certain legal positions, which would have been possible if traditional
    enforcement procedures were followed, and thus effectively eliminating an opportunity
    for lawmakers to gauge the effectiveness of the laws enacted (Yeung, [2017](#CR28)).

    occur – if parties are using smart contracts, the entire transactional arrangement
    could be digitalized and programmed, such that offer, acceptance, payment, etc.
    occur virtually and seamlessly. This has effects on the role of lawyers in such
    transactions, which may shift from physical drafting and review of documents to
    digital analysis of the smart contract to ensure that the virtual process occurs
    without any issues or glitches, as well as understanding the future legal framework
    in place for smart contracts if a dispute is required.

    on the side of any party to a contract in terms of performance affect the main
    purpose of contracting as a whole, and this is made worse in the event that a
    party or parties need to employ legal mechanisms (such as the court, arbitration,
    etc.) to settle the issues in performance. Blockchain aims to do this through
    its algorithms, which can be coded in such a manner as to automatically detect
    when certain conditions are made. For example, if a condition precedent to the
    consummation of a contract for petroleum products is that the price per barrel
    of oil has to be $40, the smart contract can be coded in such a manner that it
    scans and checks the price per barrel automatically, and once such a price level
    is reached, it executes the contract without need for further input from the parties.

    blockchain technology to create a decentralized network of digital currency. Essentially,
    individuals can transact using the digital currency such that records of each

    signing a hash of a preceding transaction and the public key of the individual
    to whom the bitcoin will be transferred. The transaction is then published to
    every node connected on the blockchain network for verification. The process of
    verification by the various nodes on the network is regarded as ‘reaching consensus’
    (Nakamoto). The information contained in every bitcoin transaction may differ
    for various blockchain implementations, notwithstanding the method applied in
    transacting  in substantially the same. A user on the blockchain network inputs
    information, which is then transmitted to various nodes. Depending on the use

- en: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – Nigeria’s capital market regulator
    – has, however, taken a different approach to digital assets. In consideration
    of the report issued by the Fintech Roadmap Committee for the Nigerian Capital
    Market in 2019, the SEC on September 14, 2020, stated treatment and classification
    of digital assets. From the statement, the SEC will now regulate crypto-token
    or crypto-coin investments provided the character of the crypto-token or crypto-coin
    investment qualifies as a securities transaction.

- en: Unlike some other jurisdictions where cryptocurrency has been recognized as
    a form of currency, the SEC  has been adopted to treat cryptocurrencies as securities
    unless otherwise proven. This, therefore, places the burden of proof on the issuer
    or sponsor to establish that the crypto assets proposed to be offered are not
    in fact securities and therefore should not be treated as such. By the SEC’s statement,
    all Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Digital Assets Token Offering (DATOs), Security
    Token ICOs, and other forms of blockchain-based digital assets offerings within
    Nigeria or offered from outside Nigeria but targeted at Nigerians now come under
    the regulatory purview of the SEC. By so doing, digital asset offerings that existed
    before the statement from the SEC are required to either make an assessment filing
    or, where the relevant assets already qualify as securities, make a registration
    filing with the SEC.

    not change the landscape for distributed ledger transactions in a substantial
    manner as it caters for just one application of distributed ledger transactions
    which is crypto assets. Even then, the CBN still does not recognize digital assets
    like cryptocurrencies as legal tender and has gone so far as to recently ban it.
    It remains to be seen how the CBN and SEC’s seemingly conflicting positions will
    be resolved as there has been large public pushback against the CBN ban, as it
    is deemed by many to be veering in a direction away from the progression made
    through blockchain  .

- en: The application  of blockchain technology, particularly in the development of
    cryptocurrencies and other forms of digital assets, has given revenue authorities
    much work to do in extending their regulatory oversight to tax financial transactions
    involving the use of cryptocurrencies. Revenue authorities are faced with the
    challenges of applying the existing legal framework to the taxation of a digitalized
    economy. In contrast, most of the regulations were made on a fixed based model
    and, in certain instances, significant economic presence, which in itself is difficult
    to determine in economies without adequate records of digital transactions. Blockchain-related
    financial transactions are exclusively within the purview of the digital economy,
    and the fact that the transaction can take place across different nodes poses
    an even greater challenge of identifying the jurisdiction of value creation to
    determine the rights of the revenue authority to lay taxable rights claim to such
    transactions. Once that hurdle of identification had been crossed, the bigger
    hurdle of determining the applicability of existing profit allocation rules that
    were preconceived on permanent establishment  and fixed based concepts arises
    (Salmon & Meyers, [2019](#CR24)).

- en: Additionally, the nonrecognition  by certain jurisdictions (including Nigeria)
    of the status of digital assets like cryptocurrency as legal tender furthers the
    taxation difficulty. Are the digital assets regarded as money or commodities such
    that an exchange of a digital currency either cash, services, or goods should
    amount to either an income or capital gain? This is essential as different tax
    treatments will be afforded to a digital asset transaction depending on whether
    it constitutes income for personal income tax purposes or capital gain or loss
    for capital tax purposes (Salmon & Meyers, [2019](#CR24)).

    for the taxation of blockchain transactions and the digital economy in general.
    The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), the apex revenue authority in Nigeria,
    is yet to openly make any statement regarding the taxation of the digital economy.
    Different authors have speculated that the Finance Act 2019, which introduced
    the concept of ‘Significant Economic Presence’ to taxation in Nigeria, is an attempt
    to capture the digital economy, but whether this would be successful or not is
    a different matter not covered by the scope of this chapter (Komolafe & Chukwuani,
    [2020](#CR13)). In February 2020, the Minister of Finance issued a Companies Income
    Tax (Significant Economic Presence) Order 2020, which sought to clarify the Significant
    Economic Presence concept. Some commentaries on order indicate that the order
    has raised more questions than it provided solutions. It is hoped that there would
    be clarifications made by the FIRS regarding the questions raised by the order,
    particularly  as it relates to blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrency
    (Abayomi, [2020](#CR1)).

- en: Blockchain technology has an undeniable presence in the world economy. Its ability
    to cross jurisdictions and affect transactions worldwide should galvanize countries
    across the globe to provide necessary laws and regulations that will govern the
    rights and obligations of the users of blockchain technology. In the years to
    come, there will be a development of exiting blockchain structures to accommodate
    some of the issues that will arise from its current application and changes in
    the regulatory regime. While one must recognize that blockchain will continue
    to progress substantially, it is difficult to say whether it would eliminate the
    need for some traditional processes currently adopted in various sectors. One
    of the reasons for this is the challenge with the scalability of blockchain.

- en: Blockchain technology displays potential for revolutionizing various sectors
    and activities, but the technical challenge of scalability poses a threat to its
    many potentials. Currently, the block size limit of bitcoin is one megabyte, and
    it is estimated that the transaction processing capacity of 7 transactions in
    a second (Zheng et al., [2018](#CR29)). The scalability concern is reduced in
    a permissioned blockchain as the data are stored on every computer in the network,
    and all nodes verify all transactions. However, when the nodes and users with
    access to the blockchain system increase, the users with access to verification
    will substantially reduce and will lead to an increased form on centralization.
    Given that permissioned blockchain systems require only a few predetermined users
    for verification, there would be a greater chance of scalability to match the
    processing demands caused by the increase in transactions (Peters & Panayi, [2015](#CR22)).

    technology should be encouraged, especially by developing economies. This is because
    of the potentially substantial economic shift with the attendant changes it may
    bring to financial services and transactions.

    optimize internal processes or to optimize their services to clients, it is important
    that great consideration is given regarding the nature of the blockchain system
    to adopt, as each is likely to result in different outcomes and requirements.
    Bringing this to the case study, in particular, Nigeria would require a regulatory
    overhaul and a deliberate shift toward digitalization of various aspects of her
    economy to minimize or avoid the potential risks and challenges that may occur
    in the wake of the changes that may result from the application of blockchain
    technology.

    country to undertake the legalization of cryptocurrencies. Amendments to Nigeria’s
    existing body of laws may be necessary as well in the event Nigeria chooses to
    explore this option. In this regard, a leaf could be borrowed from Malta, given
    that it was the first country to take regulatory steps with respect to blockchain
    technology, and some lessons may be learned from their experience thus far. In
    doing any of the foregoing, caution must, however, be applied, and extensive consultation
    of all stakeholders in governments and the financial sector would be necessary.
    Unless the issues discussed (and many others not discussed in this chapter) are
    addressed, any hasty regulation made in Nigeria will join the annals of forward-looking
    legislation without considering its practicability and enforcement.
