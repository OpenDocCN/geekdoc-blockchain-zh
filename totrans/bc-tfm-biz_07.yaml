- en: 'Climate change, and the resulting green energy revolution, is, in its essence,
    a production technology, so the economic shift will revolve around a drop in the
    cost of clean energy production. The impact of a reduction in price of clean energy
    production is that goods and services that rely on (clean) energy will become
    cheaper, whereas the value of products and services that complement clean energy
    will rise, such as the EnergyTech space. As long as the price of clean energy
    production drops and the value of related activities increases, the value of substitutes,
    such as fossil fuels, will eventually fall. So, economically it makes sense to
    start investing in clean energy or EnergyTech and reduce dependency on fossil
    fuels in your business models. Already, we see that, in some countries, the price
    of producing renewable energy is on a par with the price of producing fossil fuel
    energy. In 2016, solar and wind energy became even cheaper to produce than new
    fossil fuel energy in 30 countries [240], and it is expected that this ‘grid parity’
    will be achieved by dozens more countries in the years to come. In fact, the average
    global cost of solar energy could fall below coal within the next decade. According
    to Michael Drexler, Head of Investors Industries and Member of the Executive Committee

    now constitutes the best chance to reverse global warming. It is not only a commercially

- en: Wide-area power outages such as the incident in New York are a problem for any
    country or city, and restoring power after an outage can often be very difficult
    and time-consuming. As a result, governments and organisations are looking for
    new solutions that can prevent wide-area outages and restore power more quickly
    in the case of an outage. One way to achieve this is through the use of a smart
    grid, ideally consisting of multiple micro-grids. A smart grid is a power network
    that is equipped with all kinds of sensors at different points in the supply chain
    of electricity. Sensors monitor the production of electricity, the transportation
    of electricity, and the demand for electricity. Using big data analytics, energy
    companies can predict supply and demand for different areas as well as any upcoming
    maintenance, reducing the likelihood of a power outage due to failed equipment.
    A smart grid will automatically match supply and demand and in the (not-too-distant)
    future it is probable that the smart grid will determine when you can charge your
    electric car (if everyone who drives an electric car and comes home from work
    would plug in their car and start charging it, this would result in a peak demand,
    which could cause the network to default). Smart grids offer a lot of advantages
    for governments, organisations, and consumers in terms of reliability and costs
    of electricity, but they are also very difficult to develop, due to the existing
    complexity within our existing energy networks. Therefore, a great way to start
    is by developing a micro-grid. A micro-grid is a small, independent, energy grid,
    which most of the time uses renewable energy. A micro-grid can be disconnected
    from the main energy grid, so that, in the event of a wide-area power outage,
    a micro-grid remains operational. Developing a smart micro-grid is a lot easier
    than developing a regional or national smart grid, because often only a few houses
    or buildings are involved within the smart micro-grid. Within a micro-grid, individuals
    will harness solar or wind energy and so become energy neutral, or even energy
    positive, meaning that they generate more energy than they use. In such events,
    energy can be sold back to the main grid, or to different participants in the
    micro-grid. As selling or buying energy is basically a transaction, it is perfectly
    suited to the Blockchain making these peer-to-peer transactions in a trustless
    environment that is immutable, verifiable, and traceable.

- en: 'In the previous weeks, Orsini had built a micro-grid on President Street in
    Brooklyn, New York. Ten homes on President Street had been connected to each other,
    five on each side. One side of the street produced renewable energy, independently
    from the state grid, whereas the other side did not have solar panels but wanted
    to buy local solar energy. The objective of the pilot was to produce renewable
    energy using solar panels on rooftops of the homes and sell any excess to the
    houses on the other side of the street using Blockchain, without the involvement
    of national energy companies. As Lawrence explained, ‘Blockchain technology is
    rapidly advancing across many sectors, but in the energy market, things are comparatively
    different. With our micro-grid solution in Brooklyn, we’ll demonstrate just the
    beginning of what blockchain can do in the transactive energy world’ [247]. As
    it happened, on 11 April 2016 the first paid energy transaction took place between
    two individuals: long-term local and social justice activist Eric Fruman traded
    his excess solar energy from his rooftop installation to ex-Energy Star National
    Director Bob Sauchelli [248]. The use of Blockchain technology enabled the participants
    in the micro-grid to see exactly who consumed or produced what amount of energy
    and exactly what transactions took place when. The micro-grid in Brooklyn was
    based on the Ethereum Blockchain to record the buying and selling of any electrons
    that were generated by the solar panels using trading energy certificates. As
    such, the blockchain enabled the residents of President Street to buy and sell
    renewable energy directly to and from their neighbours, without having to go through
    a centralised party such as a large energy company. However, rather than exchanging
    the actual electrons, the solution was developed to exchange energy certificates,
    that is the right to use a certain amount of energy. As Orsini explained during
    the launch of the project, there is no ‘billing component around it, you don’t
    have the infrastructure losses or the accounting losses in the system, while the
    energy and the money goes to benefit the community. When you buy energy from the
    community, the money goes back to the community’ [249].'

    solar energy system and they use Blockchain to authenticate energy transactions
    [250]. Samsung and IBM are also working on Blockchain solutions for smart grids.
    They developed a platform called ADEPT, which uses smart contracts on Ethereum
    to manage micro-transactions between smart appliances on a smart grid, because
    they autonomously react to changing grid conditions. The platform is a Blockchain–Internet
    of Things initiative and so very suitable for smart grids. These interactions
    will make a smart grid more stable, because peaks and lows in energy production
    and demand can be flattened out.

    technology. Once something can be represented in ones and zeros, it becomes a
    data product, or service, which means that it opens up to the same exponential
    growth as we have seen with information-based technology [251]. Traditionally,
    energy production and distribution have been very centralised and analogue. Fossil
    fuel production requires large corporations to invest billions of dollars in equipment
    to retrieve oil from the depth of an ocean or to frack gas from deep underground.
    Apart from the analogue process, the distribution of that energy is done by centralised,
    often government-owned, grid companies. These companies move energy around the
    globe and determine the pricing, which has an impact on the world economy; if
    OPEC decides to reduce or increase oil production, it has an impact on everyone.
    However, energy production is moving away from a centralised approach to a decentralised
    one and is rapidly becoming digitised as well, thanks to new start-ups and new

- en: Carbon emissions are a significant contributing cause of climate change; the
    carbon footprint is defined as the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused
    by an event, organisation, or country. In the past years, governments around the
    globe have worked hard to try to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. As such,
    carbon pricing was invented, which is a certain amount of money that must be paid
    for the right to emit one tonne of CO[2] into the atmosphere. These rights can
    be traded if an organisation has any left or if an organisation or country is
    emitting more carbon dioxide than allowed. However, there are significant challenges
    with the system because they take place in international markets. As a consequence,
    taxation arrangements, fraud, crime or currency fluctuations, and transaction
    settlement costs affect the success of carbon credit transactions [256]. The global
    carbon market continues to grow and, in 2015, the total value rose by 9% to US$52.6
    billion [257]. Next to that, voluntary buyers traded a total of 84.1 million tonnes
    of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO[2]e) in 2015, representing a 10% increase over
    2014 [258]. This continued growth, as well as the associated challenges of a global
    carbon marketplace, require a new approach to carbon credits trading. Blockchain
    is the perfect technology for improving the system. It enables reduced transaction
    settlement times (because anyone with access to the Blockchain instantly has an
    updated record), increases efficiency and transparency (currently carbon trading
    is notoriously not transparent) because all transactions are verifiable and traceable
    on the blockchain, and significantly reduces the costs of carbon trading, virtually
    eliminating fraud in carbon credits trading, because transactions are immutable
    and governed by smart contracts. The use of smart contracts could automate a large
    part of the trading process, while at the same time removing any taxation or juridical
    uncertainties, because the code of the smart contracts is universally readable
    and understandable.

    Western Australian CleanTech evangelist, believes that ‘consumers want to become
    “prosumers” and become citizen utilities and that this is a technology that will
    enable them to do that’ [261]. The blockchain-enabled, energy-trading platform
    removes the need for trust between individual energy traders, and energy transactions
    can be carried out frictionless among people unknown to each other. For consumers
    to participate in the energy-trading platform, they would need to install a piece
    of hardware, which must be connected to a standard digital energy meter. This
    sensor will track the amount of energy created, bought, or sold, and convert this
    into tokens that can be monetised into any fiat or digital currency. However,
    peer-to-peer energy trading still has some legal challenges. Many incumbent energy
    companies do not favour empowering their customers and decentralising energy creation
    and distribution. Despite these challenges, Power Ledger is steadily expanding
    its pilot projects for peer-to-peer energy trading, with a new pilot project starting
    in Auckland, New Zealand as well as Fremantle, Australia to take part in peer-to-peer
    energy trading. Fortunately, there is a tendency towards opening up government
    regulations around peer-to-peer energy trading. The New South Wales government,
    for example, is pushing for a renewable energy, rooftop, trading scheme, which
    will enable individuals to trade energy that they generated on their rooftops
    with other individuals or businesses within their local community [262]. When
    households can be turned into mini-generators and electricity retailers, it could
    result in reduced costs for everyone and an increase in available renewable energy—a
    win–win situation for the people and for the Earth.

    It will become possible to link a smart grid to a blockchain platform and when
    tokens or crypto-coins are used, it becomes possible to have connected devices
    perform transactions among each other automatically through smart contracts. Imagine
    a connected device that automatically pays for a little bit of energy consumption
    when it performs a certain activity using a cryptocurrency. In the future, the
    analysis performed by the connected device can be sold automatically using micro-transactions
    to anyone interested and, with the revenue made, it can pay for the energy consumed.
    Everything will work automatically and instantly using smart contracts and all
    transactions will be recorded on a blockchain. Price differentiation can be used
    to incentivise connected devices to use renewable energy instead of traditional
    energy. The Internet of Things in combination with Clean EnergyTech and the Blockchain
    will drastically change how we, and connected devices, consume and pay for electricity.

    insights into their energy consumption and, by connecting to weather forecasts
    and real-time electricity pricing, it automatically optimises the heating of their
    homes, increasing the heating when prices are low, or limiting heating when prices
    are high. Blockchain and smart contracts are used as a push for renewable energy

- en: The South African company Bankymoon has developed a typical African solution
    for an African problem. In South Africa, many individuals pay for the electricity
    after they have consumed it, as happens in many countries in the world. However,
    in South Africa, many middlemen are involved in the billing of energy, thereby
    significantly raising the price. As a result, many South Africans have difficulties
    paying their utility bills, resulting in large losses for the energy companies.
    Therefore, Bankymoon has developed a pre-paid solution that enables citizens to
    pre-pay for their energy. However, as most of the Africans don’t have a bank account,
    and paying in cash is too expensive, Bankymoon reverted to pre-paid blockchain
    smart meters. Individuals send bitcoin to the bitcoin wallet attached to their
    smart meter, and in exchange the user receives credits for energy consumption.
    In the end, such a solution will empower Africans, making them more aware of their
    energy consumption, which, in the long run, could reduce their energy consumption
    [272]. Although this solution is only carried out on very small scale (after all,
    more people still have bank accounts and use cash money than use bitcoin), it
    shows the potential of blockchain and energy for the developed world.

  zh: 南非公司Bankymoon为南非问题提供了一个典型的非洲解决方案。在南非，许多人在消耗完电之后才支付电费，这种情况在世界许多国家都存在。然而，在南非，许多中间商参与能源计费，从而大幅提高了价格。因此，许多南非人在支付公共事业费用时遇到困难，导致能源公司遭受巨大损失。因此，Bankymoon开发了一种预付费解决方案，使公民能够预付他们的能源费用。然而，由于大多数非洲人没有银行账户，现金支付又太昂贵，Bankymoon退而使用预付费的区块链智能电表。个人将比特币发送到与他们智能电表关联的比特币钱包，作为交换，用户获得能源消费的积分。最终，这种解决方案将赋予非洲人权力，使他们更加了解自己的能源消耗，从长远来看，这可能会减少他们的能源消耗[272]。尽管这种解决方案只在非常小的规模上进行（毕竟，拥有银行账户和使用现金的人数还是比使用比特币的人数多），但它展示了区块链和能源在发达国家的前景。

    the Internet of Things and renewable energy is the company ElectriCCHain. ElectriCChain
    is an open solar energy generation data project with an initial focus on verifying
    and publishing data from seven million solar energy generators globally and on
    an open Blockchain. ElectriCChain uses a crypto-coin, SolarCoin, to incentivise
    solar electricity generation. In February 2017, SolarCoin had a market cap of
    US$9 billion and was the world’s largest community solar electricity reward programme.
    SolarCoins are rewarded to anyone generating solar electricity and 1 MWh of solar
    energy represents 1 SolarCoin. Any verified solar energy producer can get SolarCoins
    for free and 99% of the SolarCoins will be distributed to 97,500 TWh over the
    next 40 years. The data provided by the connected solar installations enables
    ElectriCChain to empower its users to deliver cheap and clean energy. The objective
    of ElectriCChain is to gather non-confidential energy data related to solar energy
    and build a network of millions of solar installations worldwide. In 2017, they
    had 7 million solar installations connected to the blockchain, which they aim
    to increase to 200 million in 15–25 years.

- en: The energy sector has tremendous opportunities for change and improvement using
    Blockchain technology. Clean energy tech start-ups are developing new solutions
    and applications that focus on renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions, and
    developing smart grids. Blockchain can assist these start-ups in offering a decentralised
    solution that is reliable and effective thanks to the usage of cryptography to
    ensure trust and crypto-tokens to trade value. As such, Blockchain has a significant
    chance to help combat climate change because it enables the creation, usage, and
    exchange of renewable energy in a trustworthy and reliable manner. However, it
    should be noted that blockchain also costs a lot of energy, especially the bitcoin
    blockchain that uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism. The computational power
    required to calculate the mathematics of Proof of Work needs a tremendous amount
    of energy. Different consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake, require significantly
    less computational power and energy, and many start-ups are working on more environmentally
    friendly consensus mechanisms. Eventually, the application of Blockchain in the
    energy sector could result in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). VPPs are independent
    energy-generating resources that are connected using the Internet of Things across
    a smart grid. These renewable energy installations are geographically distributed
    and not concentrated at one central location as is the case with traditional power
    plants [273]. VPPs bring together different technologies such as the Internet

  zh: 能源部门可以通过使用区块链技术迎来巨大的变革和提升空间。清洁能源技术初创公司正在开发新的解决方案和应用，这些方案和应用专注于可再生能源、减少碳排放以及发展智能电网。区块链可以协助这些初创公司提供一种去中心化的解决方案，这种方案由于采用了密码学来确保信任和加密代币来进行价值交易而变得可靠和有效。因此，区块链技术在帮助抗击气候变化方面拥有巨大的潜力，因为它使创建、使用和交换可再生能源变得既值得信赖又可靠。然而，需要注意的是，区块链技术本身也消耗大量能源，尤其是采用工作量证明（Proof
    of Work）共识机制的比特币区块链。计算工作量证明所需的数学运算需要大量的能源。不同的共识机制，如权益证明（Proof of Stake），需要 significantly
    less 计算能力和能源，许多初创公司正在研究更加环保的共识机制。最终，区块链在能源领域的应用可能会导致虚拟电厂（VPPs）的出现。虚拟电厂是独立发电资源，通过物联网连接到一个智能电网。这些可再生能源装置地理位置分布广泛，并不集中在像传统电厂那样的一个中央位置[273]。虚拟电厂汇集了物联网、大数据分析以及区块链等不同的技术，共同开发未来的电厂。
- en: A decentralised and distributed power plant offers significant advantages over
    a traditional power plant, for example it will be a lot more resilient in the
    case of a natural disaster. If one node is taken out of the distributed network
    due to a hurricane, the other micro-grids can remain operational and even take
    over energy distribution to the affected area. In addition to this, smart contracts
    will enable fair and immediate payment for any creation, distribution, or usage
    of energy across the grid using crypto-tokens, and enable individuals or organisations
    to trade any surplus energy that they generate, thereby creating an additional
    revenue stream. Furthermore, Blockchain will prevent fraudulent actions, while
    at the same time offering transparency in energy usage across different stakeholders
    because any energy transaction data will be recorded on a (private) Blockchain
    and become immutable, verifiable, and traceable. Insights into how renewable energy
    is created, distributed, and used will enable the VPP to flatten out energy demand
    and prevent peak demands, when at the end of day everyone connects his or her
    electric car to the grid. In addition, smart homes, offices, or cities can optimise
    their energy consumption based on real-time energy pricing, thereby reducing energy
    consumption as well as the energy bill.
