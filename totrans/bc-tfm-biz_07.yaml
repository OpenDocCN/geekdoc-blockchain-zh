    In most parts of the city, the temperatures topped 47°C. Less than a year before,
    on 11 February 2017, temperatures in Sydney also soared and reached a peak of
    47.6°C. Half-way through February 2017, the maximum temperature for that month
    was 4° above average and the warm month followed Sydney’s second-hottest December
    and hottest January since the start of the records, dating back to 1858 [227].
    Meanwhile, the North Pole was experiencing its own version of a heat wave. With
    temperatures rising to melting point, 0°Celsius, for the third time in the winter
    of 2017 [228, 229]. Finally, the USA also experienced an unusual heat wave in
    the winter of 2017\. In Oklahoma and Texas, temperatures went up to 37°Celsius,
    which was a new all-time record for February high temperatures [230].

    the world’s marine ecosystems [234], our biodiversity [235], and our economic

    thousands of scientists from around the globe that climate change is real and
    that we need to act now. The Paris agreement, which was signed in 2015 within
    United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), underlines and
    confirms the problem. The agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries
    and has the objective of ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature
    to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the
    temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ [237, p. 2]. Instead,

    and most of the time quite big as well. As technological progress is made, the
    technology becomes cheaper, easier to use, and gets more applications (whether
    for good or bad). The printing press significantly improved access to knowledge
    and made education cheaper. The steam engine created energy and made a wide variety
    of activities easier, cheaper, and more accessible. The mainframe computer significantly
    reduced the cost of communication and finding information. In this way, technological
    revolutions tend to involve certain important activities becoming cheaper and

    a production technology, so the economic shift will revolve around a drop in the
    cost of clean energy production. The impact of a reduction in price of clean energy
    production is that goods and services that rely on (clean) energy will become
    cheaper, whereas the value of products and services that complement clean energy
    will rise, such as the EnergyTech space. As long as the price of clean energy
    production drops and the value of related activities increases, the value of substitutes,
    such as fossil fuels, will eventually fall. So, economically it makes sense to
    start investing in clean energy or EnergyTech and reduce dependency on fossil
    fuels in your business models. Already, we see that, in some countries, the price
    of producing renewable energy is on a par with the price of producing fossil fuel
    energy. In 2016, solar and wind energy became even cheaper to produce than new
    fossil fuel energy in 30 countries [240], and it is expected that this ‘grid parity’
    will be achieved by dozens more countries in the years to come. In fact, the average
    global cost of solar energy could fall below coal within the next decade. According
    to Michael Drexler, Head of Investors Industries and Member of the Executive Committee
    at the World Economic Forum: ‘renewable energy has reached a tipping point—it
    now constitutes the best chance to reverse global warming. It is not only a commercially

    thousands of people homeless. During the following days, the hurricane increased
    in strength and, when it arrived in New York, it had become the largest Atlantic
    hurricane ever recorded [245]. In the days that followed, New York was severely
    damaged, reaching almost US$42 billion in damages [246] and leaving vast parts
    of the city without electricity. In total, 2.2 million people lost power due to
    the hurricane, which took up to several weeks to restore for everyone, leaving
    Lower Manhattan and other parts of New York in the dark—a surreal experience for
    those being hit by the sudden power outages. In the weeks following, the power
    grid was fully restored, but it came at a cost.

- en: Wide-area power outages such as the incident in New York are a problem for any
    country or city, and restoring power after an outage can often be very difficult
    and time-consuming. As a result, governments and organisations are looking for
    new solutions that can prevent wide-area outages and restore power more quickly
    in the case of an outage. One way to achieve this is through the use of a smart
    grid, ideally consisting of multiple micro-grids. A smart grid is a power network
    that is equipped with all kinds of sensors at different points in the supply chain
    of electricity. Sensors monitor the production of electricity, the transportation
    of electricity, and the demand for electricity. Using big data analytics, energy
    companies can predict supply and demand for different areas as well as any upcoming
    maintenance, reducing the likelihood of a power outage due to failed equipment.
    A smart grid will automatically match supply and demand and in the (not-too-distant)
    future it is probable that the smart grid will determine when you can charge your
    electric car (if everyone who drives an electric car and comes home from work
    would plug in their car and start charging it, this would result in a peak demand,
    which could cause the network to default). Smart grids offer a lot of advantages
    for governments, organisations, and consumers in terms of reliability and costs
    of electricity, but they are also very difficult to develop, due to the existing
    complexity within our existing energy networks. Therefore, a great way to start
    is by developing a micro-grid. A micro-grid is a small, independent, energy grid,
    which most of the time uses renewable energy. A micro-grid can be disconnected
    from the main energy grid, so that, in the event of a wide-area power outage,
    a micro-grid remains operational. Developing a smart micro-grid is a lot easier
    than developing a regional or national smart grid, because often only a few houses
    or buildings are involved within the smart micro-grid. Within a micro-grid, individuals
    will harness solar or wind energy and so become energy neutral, or even energy
    positive, meaning that they generate more energy than they use. In such events,
    energy can be sold back to the main grid, or to different participants in the
    micro-grid. As selling or buying energy is basically a transaction, it is perfectly
    suited to the Blockchain making these peer-to-peer transactions in a trustless
    environment that is immutable, verifiable, and traceable.

    and often conservative industry. Lawrence Orsini is the founder of LO3 Energy,
    an energy- and technology-centric company that builds tools and develops projects
    to accelerate the proliferation of the emerging distributed energy and computation
    economy. On that sunny spring day in Brooklyn, Lawrence went to work, with the
    objective of creating a world first.

    Brooklyn, New York. Ten homes on President Street had been connected to each other,
    five on each side. One side of the street produced renewable energy, independently
    from the state grid, whereas the other side did not have solar panels but wanted
    to buy local solar energy. The objective of the pilot was to produce renewable
    energy using solar panels on rooftops of the homes and sell any excess to the
    houses on the other side of the street using Blockchain, without the involvement
    of national energy companies. As Lawrence explained, ‘Blockchain technology is
    rapidly advancing across many sectors, but in the energy market, things are comparatively
    different. With our micro-grid solution in Brooklyn, we’ll demonstrate just the
    beginning of what blockchain can do in the transactive energy world’ [247]. As
    it happened, on 11 April 2016 the first paid energy transaction took place between
    two individuals: long-term local and social justice activist Eric Fruman traded
    his excess solar energy from his rooftop installation to ex-Energy Star National
    Director Bob Sauchelli [248]. The use of Blockchain technology enabled the participants
    in the micro-grid to see exactly who consumed or produced what amount of energy
    and exactly what transactions took place when. The micro-grid in Brooklyn was
    based on the Ethereum Blockchain to record the buying and selling of any electrons
    that were generated by the solar panels using trading energy certificates. As
    such, the blockchain enabled the residents of President Street to buy and sell
    renewable energy directly to and from their neighbours, without having to go through
    a centralised party such as a large energy company. However, rather than exchanging
    the actual electrons, the solution was developed to exchange energy certificates,
    that is the right to use a certain amount of energy. As Orsini explained during
    the launch of the project, there is no ‘billing component around it, you don’t
    have the infrastructure losses or the accounting losses in the system, while the
    energy and the money goes to benefit the community. When you buy energy from the
    community, the money goes back to the community’ [249].'

    and consumption. The benefits of a decentralised and distributed energy system
    is that it enables transparent, efficient, and effective trading between different,
    local stakeholders while taking grid-specific requirements into account [247].
    As a result, these micro-grids may become more resistant than centralised energy
    grids when natural catastrophes happen, such as Superstorm Sandy, allowing people
    to keep their energy, during major infrastructural failure [249], and also making

    install solar panels or windmills because they offer an additional return on the

    energy production and distribution have been very centralised and analogue. Fossil
    fuel production requires large corporations to invest billions of dollars in equipment
    to retrieve oil from the depth of an ocean or to frack gas from deep underground.
    Apart from the analogue process, the distribution of that energy is done by centralised,
    often government-owned, grid companies. These companies move energy around the
    globe and determine the pricing, which has an impact on the world economy; if
    OPEC decides to reduce or increase oil production, it has an impact on everyone.

    one and is rapidly becoming digitised as well, thanks to new start-ups and new

    moving from hand production to machine production, offered citizens energy to
    improve their daily lives and resulted in a new organisation design that ensured
    more efficient and better production of goods. The Industrial Revolution propelled
    humankind into a new, more prosperous era. Unfortunately, it also resulted in
    a massive increase in greenhouse gases because human activities have resulted
    in a 40% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, from 280
    parts per million (ppm) in 1750 to 400 ppm in 2015 [253]. The emission of carbon
    dioxide affects everyone. CO[2] released in India will affect the people in the
    USA and coal factories operating in Beijing will have an impact on the climate

    temperature could exceed historical values by 2047 [254] and the limit of a rise
    of 2°C could be reached as early as 2036 [255]. This highlights the importance

    carbon footprint is defined as the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused
    by an event, organisation, or country. In the past years, governments around the
    globe have worked hard to try to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. As such,
    carbon pricing was invented, which is a certain amount of money that must be paid
    for the right to emit one tonne of CO[2] into the atmosphere. These rights can
    be traded if an organisation has any left or if an organisation or country is
    emitting more carbon dioxide than allowed. However, there are significant challenges
    with the system because they take place in international markets. As a consequence,
    taxation arrangements, fraud, crime or currency fluctuations, and transaction
    settlement costs affect the success of carbon credit transactions [256]. The global
    carbon market continues to grow and, in 2015, the total value rose by 9% to US$52.6
    billion [257]. Next to that, voluntary buyers traded a total of 84.1 million tonnes
    of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO[2]e) in 2015, representing a 10% increase over
    2014 [258]. This continued growth, as well as the associated challenges of a global
    carbon marketplace, require a new approach to carbon credits trading. Blockchain
    is the perfect technology for improving the system. It enables reduced transaction
    settlement times (because anyone with access to the Blockchain instantly has an
    updated record), increases efficiency and transparency (currently carbon trading
    is notoriously not transparent) because all transactions are verifiable and traceable
    on the blockchain, and significantly reduces the costs of carbon trading, virtually
    eliminating fraud in carbon credits trading, because transactions are immutable
    and governed by smart contracts. The use of smart contracts could automate a large
    part of the trading process, while at the same time removing any taxation or juridical
    uncertainties, because the code of the smart contracts is universally readable

    crypto-tokens, which are tradable digital assets representing a certain energy
    production. These can be sold to others via the Blockchain to prevent double spending
    and ensure valid transactions. As a result, Blockchain enables Power Ledger to
    offer a transparent, auditable, and automated marketplace that settles and clears
    transactions between consumers in minutes, without the need for a trusted centralised
    third party such as an energy company which charges a fee for its services. The

    removes the need for trust between individual energy traders, and energy transactions
    can be carried out frictionless among people unknown to each other. For consumers
    to participate in the energy-trading platform, they would need to install a piece
    of hardware, which must be connected to a standard digital energy meter. This
    sensor will track the amount of energy created, bought, or sold, and convert this
    into tokens that can be monetised into any fiat or digital currency. However,
    peer-to-peer energy trading still has some legal challenges. Many incumbent energy
    companies do not favour empowering their customers and decentralising energy creation
    and distribution. Despite these challenges, Power Ledger is steadily expanding
    its pilot projects for peer-to-peer energy trading, with a new pilot project starting
    in Auckland, New Zealand as well as Fremantle, Australia to take part in peer-to-peer
    energy trading. Fortunately, there is a tendency towards opening up government
    regulations around peer-to-peer energy trading. The New South Wales government,
    for example, is pushing for a renewable energy, rooftop, trading scheme, which
    will enable individuals to trade energy that they generated on their rooftops
    with other individuals or businesses within their local community [262]. When
    households can be turned into mini-generators and electricity retailers, it could
    result in reduced costs for everyone and an increase in available renewable energy—a
    win–win situation for the people and for the Earth.

    of Things. The Internet of Things is a distributed network of devices that are
    connected to each other over the internet. As a result, these connected devices
    can communicate with each other, understand their needs, and adopt their behaviour
    accordingly. Before we dive into the advantages of energy data analytics, let’s
    first, briefly, discuss the Internet of Things and the impact it will have on
    energy consumption.

- en: In the coming years, the number of smart devices in our households could grow
    drastically and Gartner predicts that a typical home could contain more than 500
    smart devices by 2022 [263]. The falling costs of sensors and the upcoming domotica
    platforms, such as Apple’s Homekit, will contribute to this growth. However, this
    is just the beginning. IDC expects the market for the Internet of Things to grow
    to US$3 trillion by 2020 [264], whereas Cisco believes that the Internet of Things
    is a US$19 trillion opportunity [265]. The reason why the Internet of Things has
    become such a buzzword with such inflated expectations is because the required
    infrastructure, cloud computing, is easily available, scalable, and relatively
    cheap. The required sensors are becoming smaller, better, and cheaper every year,
    and all Internet of Things manufacturers, of course, claim that it will make everything
    in our lives ‘smart’ and our lives easier. In the coming years, the Internet of
    Things will experience enormous growth, because of (among other reasons) the expanded
    internet connectivity [266]. With the 4G roll out completed in most developed
    countries and experimentation with 5G already begun, the Internet of Things will
    get the network required to transmit trillions of messages in real-time.

    world—a connected world where billions or even trillions of devices are connected
    to the internet and to each other, in real-time. This connected world will change
    how organisations should be managed. It will change how organisations should approach
    innovation. And it will change how organisations should connect with their customers.
    The Internet of Everything will change innovation as we know it which will drastically
    impact energy consumption. Once there are dozens, or hundreds, of smart devices
    in your home, it becomes possible to optimise their energy consumption through
    smart meters. A smart meter is an electrical meter that monitors the energy consumption
    every 15 minutes or every hour. In the (near) future, smart meters will, however,
    be able to monitor the energy consumption of each individual product in a house
    in real-time and suggest, for example, a better timing to do your laundry based
    on real-time demand, forecasts, and pricing.

    smart offices, smart manufacturers, or even smart cities. The new Deloitte Head
    Office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, was certified as the most sustainable office
    building in the world in 2016 [267]. The building, called the Edge, is packed
    with 28,000 sensors that monitor everything in real-time, while generating gigabytes
    of data daily. As a result, the building optimises itself based on the number
    of employees in the building or the weather, significantly reducing the energy
    consumption in the office [268]. The South Korean city Songdo takes smartness
    a step further. The city has been built from the ground up and is completely connected
    to a smart grid. Songdo is located 40 miles from Seoul and will become a completely
    connected city, where almost any device, building, or road will be equipped with
    wireless sensors or microchips that generate massive amounts of data, which help
    reduce the energy consumption of the city [269].

    and cities in the future, and this will enable us to drastically reduce energy
    consumption. Once hundreds of smart devices have been connected to smart meters,
    which in turn are linked to a smart grid, it becomes possible to optimise the
    energy consumption, demand, and distribution in real-time. The analysis of massive
    amounts of energy data will help organisations such as universities, meteorological
    organisations, and financial institutions to gain insights from energy consumption.
    This information can help create new applications and reduce energy consumption.
    It will become possible to link a smart grid to a blockchain platform and when
    tokens or crypto-coins are used, it becomes possible to have connected devices
    perform transactions among each other automatically through smart contracts. Imagine
    a connected device that automatically pays for a little bit of energy consumption
    when it performs a certain activity using a cryptocurrency. In the future, the
    analysis performed by the connected device can be sold automatically using micro-transactions
    to anyone interested and, with the revenue made, it can pay for the energy consumed.
    Everything will work automatically and instantly using smart contracts and all
    transactions will be recorded on a blockchain. Price differentiation can be used
    to incentivise connected devices to use renewable energy instead of traditional
    energy. The Internet of Things in combination with Clean EnergyTech and the Blockchain
    will drastically change how we, and connected devices, consume and pay for electricity.

    consumers to control their connected devices over the internet. Consumers living
    in connected homes can use Fortrum to optimise heating inside their houses and
    get insights into their electricity consumption. A dashboard offers real-time
    insights into their energy consumption and, by connecting to weather forecasts
    and real-time electricity pricing, it automatically optimises the heating of their
    homes, increasing the heating when prices are low, or limiting heating when prices
    are high. Blockchain and smart contracts are used as a push for renewable energy
    and to be better able to respond to small loads required by connected devices
    [270, 271], enabling micro-transactions using a cryptocurrency, which would not
    be viable with fiat money.

- en: The South African company Bankymoon has developed a typical African solution
    for an African problem. In South Africa, many individuals pay for the electricity
    after they have consumed it, as happens in many countries in the world. However,
    in South Africa, many middlemen are involved in the billing of energy, thereby
    significantly raising the price. As a result, many South Africans have difficulties
    paying their utility bills, resulting in large losses for the energy companies.
    Therefore, Bankymoon has developed a pre-paid solution that enables citizens to
    pre-pay for their energy. However, as most of the Africans don’t have a bank account,
    and paying in cash is too expensive, Bankymoon reverted to pre-paid blockchain
    smart meters. Individuals send bitcoin to the bitcoin wallet attached to their
    smart meter, and in exchange the user receives credits for energy consumption.
    In the end, such a solution will empower Africans, making them more aware of their
    energy consumption, which, in the long run, could reduce their energy consumption
    [272]. Although this solution is only carried out on very small scale (after all,
    more people still have bank accounts and use cash money than use bitcoin), it
    shows the potential of blockchain and energy for the developed world.

    the Internet of Things and renewable energy is the company ElectriCCHain. ElectriCChain
    is an open solar energy generation data project with an initial focus on verifying
    and publishing data from seven million solar energy generators globally and on
    an open Blockchain. ElectriCChain uses a crypto-coin, SolarCoin, to incentivise
    solar electricity generation. In February 2017, SolarCoin had a market cap of
    US$9 billion and was the world’s largest community solar electricity reward programme.
    SolarCoins are rewarded to anyone generating solar electricity and 1 MWh of solar
    energy represents 1 SolarCoin. Any verified solar energy producer can get SolarCoins
    for free and 99% of the SolarCoins will be distributed to 97,500 TWh over the
    next 40 years. The data provided by the connected solar installations enables
    ElectriCChain to empower its users to deliver cheap and clean energy. The objective
    of ElectriCChain is to gather non-confidential energy data related to solar energy
    and build a network of millions of solar installations worldwide. In 2017, they
    had 7 million solar installations connected to the blockchain, which they aim
    to increase to 200 million in 15–25 years.

- en: The energy sector has tremendous opportunities for change and improvement using
    Blockchain technology. Clean energy tech start-ups are developing new solutions
    and applications that focus on renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions, and
    developing smart grids. Blockchain can assist these start-ups in offering a decentralised
    solution that is reliable and effective thanks to the usage of cryptography to
    ensure trust and crypto-tokens to trade value. As such, Blockchain has a significant
    chance to help combat climate change because it enables the creation, usage, and
    exchange of renewable energy in a trustworthy and reliable manner. However, it
    should be noted that blockchain also costs a lot of energy, especially the bitcoin
    blockchain that uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism. The computational power
    required to calculate the mathematics of Proof of Work needs a tremendous amount
    of energy. Different consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake, require significantly
    less computational power and energy, and many start-ups are working on more environmentally
    friendly consensus mechanisms. Eventually, the application of Blockchain in the
    energy sector could result in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). VPPs are independent
    energy-generating resources that are connected using the Internet of Things across
    a smart grid. These renewable energy installations are geographically distributed
    and not concentrated at one central location as is the case with traditional power
    plants [273]. VPPs bring together different technologies such as the Internet
    of Things, big data analytics, and Blockchain to develop the power plant of the
    future.

- en: A decentralised and distributed power plant offers significant advantages over
    a traditional power plant, for example it will be a lot more resilient in the
    case of a natural disaster. If one node is taken out of the distributed network
    due to a hurricane, the other micro-grids can remain operational and even take
    over energy distribution to the affected area. In addition to this, smart contracts
    will enable fair and immediate payment for any creation, distribution, or usage
    of energy across the grid using crypto-tokens, and enable individuals or organisations
    to trade any surplus energy that they generate, thereby creating an additional
    revenue stream. Furthermore, Blockchain will prevent fraudulent actions, while
    at the same time offering transparency in energy usage across different stakeholders
    because any energy transaction data will be recorded on a (private) Blockchain
    and become immutable, verifiable, and traceable. Insights into how renewable energy
    is created, distributed, and used will enable the VPP to flatten out energy demand
    and prevent peak demands, when at the end of day everyone connects his or her
    electric car to the grid. In addition, smart homes, offices, or cities can optimise
    their energy consumption based on real-time energy pricing, thereby reducing energy
    consumption as well as the energy bill.

- en: The future of energy is a decentralised and distributed one. Once individuals
    and organisations can generate, use, and distribute their own renewable energy
    it will significantly reduce the need for fossil fuels. Governments should, therefore,
    stimulate the development of VPPs, as long as they generate only renewable energy.
    The pilot projects of the different micro-grids are a great start, but there is
    still a long way to go.
