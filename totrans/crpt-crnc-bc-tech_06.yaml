    of the potential for illicit and ethically-challenging decision-making while the
    boundaries for regulation continue to be designed. The very creation of cryptocurrencies
    has somewhat challenged regulators. Cryptocurrencies have provided an exceptionally
    easy platform that can be used for cross-border trade, but they can easily generate
    illicit activity. Companies and governments alike can utilise these products for
    somewhat ‘questionable’ practices. Three specific key concerns have been identified
    in recent literature: 1) the use of cryptocurrencies by governments to circumvent
    internationally-binding sanctions and controls; 2) the announcement of companies
    of their broad intentions to enter the cryptocurrency market, with little or no
    intention of following through on their commitments; and 3) the simplistic nature
    through which investor theft has continued to escalate within the scope of unregulated
    ICOs. These situations necessitate broad consideration by regulators and policy-makers
    before the markets for cryptocurrencies can be truly identified to have evolved
    to levels similar to that of other types of traditional markets.'

    the establishment of Bitcoin and other growing cryptocurrencies and digital asset
    types. Regulatory bodies and policy-makers alike have observed the growth of cryptocurrencies
    with a certain amount of scepticism based on the growing potential for illegality
    and malpractice through the use of cryptocurrencies. Some regulatory authorities,
    including the International Monetary Fund, have expressed their satisfaction with
    the product’s development and the benefits that are contained within its continued
    growth, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amongst other international
    authorities have explicitly warned of the potential market manipulation techniques
    and ability to utilise fraudulent methods to defraud and steal from unwilling
    and unsuspecting investors.

    broad number of areas such as underlying technology, financing and governance.
    It is notable that a developing strand of research has began to focus on issues
    such as illicit usage of ICOs and the developing role that cybercriminality has
    begun to play at the point at which cryptocurrencies begin their existence. [Adhami
    et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_001) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_001)) analysed
    the determinants of the success 253 ICOs to find that the probability success
    is higher if the code source is made available, when a token presale is organized,
    and when tokens allow contributors to access a specific service (or to share profits).
    While [Hashemi Joo et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_023) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_023))
    identify that ICOs have generated billions of dollars of funding to startups and
    projects worldwide in less than two years, many successful ICOs yielded extremely
    high returns to investors. While the ICO is a revolutionary vehicle for business
    funding, it has raised concerns among users as well as potential investors about
    its risk and lack of regulation. The future of this innovative funding method
    highly depends on further development and placement of appropriate regulatory
    supervision, better understanding of risk and benefits and attaining the confidence
    of users. [Deng et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_017) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_017))
    focused on the September 2017 decision to ban ICOs in Chine, noting that the decision
    could hamper revolutionary technological developments and dampen the growth of
    this potentially beneficial market. The authors provide a non-exhaustive classification
    of the legal status of ICOs, including the pre-sale of products or services, offering
    of shares, issue of debentures, issue of derivatives, collective investment schemes
    and crowdfunding, as well as a possible regulatory reform of the current ICO ban
    in China. It is concluded that ICOs could be best regarded as pre-sale of products
    or services, whereas, the other five types of ICOs are highly likely to be considered
    as financial securities and thus should be subject to securities laws. [O’Dair
    and Owen](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_029) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_029))
    went as far as to investigate as to how new music ventures might obtain alternative
    entrepreneurial finance through token sales or ICOs, presenting evidence as to
    the breadth that this new developing market can reach. [Fisch](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_019)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_019)) assessed the determinants of the amount
    raised in 423 ICOs while drawing on signalling theory to show that technical white
    papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents
    are not associated with increased amounts of funding. The results indicate that
    some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research
    into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. [Felix
    and von Eije](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_018) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_018))
    found that the average level of under-pricing of ICOs of 123% in the US and 97%
    in the other countries. The results for the US ICOs are significantly higher than
    for US IPOs on average and also higher than US IPOs at the beginning of the dot.com
    bubble. The authors also study the determinants of ICO under-pricing. Further,
    companies that use a large issue size or a pre-ICO (a sale of cryptocurrencies
    before the ICO) leave less money on the table.

    public equity markets, and advanced digital technologies. The availability of
    investment-based crowdfunding platforms is also positively associated with the
    emergence of ICOs, while debt and private equity markets do not provide similar
    effects. Further, countries with ICO-friendly regulations have more ICOs, whereas
    tax regimes are not clearly related to ICOs. [Chen](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_006)

    in different ICO stages to investigate the relations between signal processing
    and information asymmetry. The authors find differing results throughout the different
    stages analysed, first indicating that in the crowd sale stage, high credible
    and easy-interpretable signals have significant influences on token sales. In
    the listing stage, low credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant
    effects on token trading. High credible and hard-interpretable signals, which
    deliver project fundamental information, lose their functions in both stages,
    causing information asymmetry in ICOs. Further, investor comments on social media,
    which is a multiple-way communication channel, play the role of information surveillance
    for ventures’ voluntary disclosures.'

- en: A controversial area of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) concerns financial regulators
    and businesses highlighting the importance of full and fair disclosure of corporate
    intention to incorporate blockchain technology. While ICOs can help companies
    to reduce the costs of raising capital, the lack of transparency and very limited
    information available for investors in the white papers might affect the corporate
    performance in the long run. The absence of a unified regulatory framework creates
    multiple speculation opportunities for all market players. At corporate level,
    the decision to adopt cryptocurrency or blockchain technology can change the corporate
    identity of the firm, for example, from a more conventional identity to that of
    a Fintech company, and attract a new group of investors. However, those intentions
    to adopt blockchain often stays at the stage of writing a white paper, making
    corporate announcements, or even simply changing the name of corporation, and
    not going further to actually launching the stated cryptocurrency or building
    the proposed platform. Thus corporations may try to take advantage of the euphoric
    and speculative investment motives and ride a wave on the cryptocurrency bubble.
    The explosive behaviour of the cryptocurrency markets can be compared with Dot.com
    bubble and related corporate name changes ([Cooper et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_008)

    which has occurred on multiple occasions, including the most simplistic of financial
    crime, where the host of the ICO simply disappears. Unfortunately, this type of
    scam has become far too common in recent times. Amongst the most well-known is
    that of Pincoin, representing one of the largest ICO scam in history. Together
    with Ifan, another blockchain company, 32,000 investors were duped out of the
    equivalent of $660 million. The company had promised its investors a 40% monthly
    returns on their investment, luring unsuspecting investors with claims that the
    ICO was to be overseen by PIN Foundation. Further, Modern Tech promised an 8%
    reward to every investor for bringing in another investor, indicative of a classic
    multi-level-marketing scheme with the benefit of hindsight. Titanium was another
    example of a textbook ICO case of fraud. The ICO was based on a social media marketing
    blitz that allegedly deceived investors with purely fictional claims of business
    prospects. Charges were then filed against Michael Alan Stollery, a self-described
    blockchain evangelist, who is reported to have lied about business relationships
    with the Federal Reserve and dozens of well-known firms, including PayPal, Verizon,
    Boeing, and The Walt Disney Company. The complaint alleges that Titanium’s website
    contained fabricated testimonials from corporate customers. As evidence of the
    sharp perceptions and actions of regulatory authorities, the Titanium ICO was
    stopped before it was finished.

    the OneCoin operation in the country. The company claimed to be officially licensed
    in Vietnam, but this was later refuted by the country’s government. More than
    five countries have warned investors of the risks involved for those choosing
    to invest in the company, including Thailand, Croatia, Bulgaria, Finland and Norway.
    In 2017, another example of substantial ICO fraud was that of Confido, who had
    collected 1235 Ethereum, at the time valued at approximately $375,000 before the
    price of tokens became tradable and their value subsequently skyrocketed. At one
    point, the price of one CFD token rose approximately that of twenty times the
    amount of the initial ICO price. This price jump made Confido one of the best-performing
    ICOs ever in terms of short-term token price rise, and the tiny project possessed
    a market cap of $10 million in a very short amount of time. However, a number
    of market monitors had raised suspicions based on the lack of credibility and
    the continued anonymity of those responsible. Thereafter, a message on Confido’s

    filed for creditor protection in compliance with the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement

    CA$260 million to its users. The exchange kept most its assets in offline storage
    systems called cold wallets, which are secured by digital security keys in order
    to protect them from hacking and theft. Cotten was solely responsible for the
    wallets and corresponding keys, which the company has been trying to find after

- en: 'One of the largest ICO-related announcements in recent times surrounded that
    of Project Libra, which is a proposed digital currency by that of Facebook with
    an estimated launch date during 2020\. The project, currency and transactions
    are to be managed and cryptographically entrusted to the Libra Association, which
    was founded by Facebook’s subsidiary Calibra and a number of other companies across
    payment, technology, telecommunication, online marketplace, venture capital and
    nonprofits. It was first rumoured in May 2019 that Facebook had been secretly
    planning to release a cryptocurrency, with names reported such as GlobalCoin and
    Facebook Coin. The new coin is not proposed to be decentralised, thereby firmly
    relying on trust in the Libra Association as a lender of last resort. The company
    also announced a new digital wallet called Calibra, which will be operated by
    Facebook as a separate subsidiary and provide users with a way to store and spend
    Libra. Facebook provided an image of Calibra’s design, including a three-wave
    symbol that serves as the Libra’s equivalent of a dollar sign. The currency’s
    blockchain, which is open source, will be programmed in a new language developed
    by Facebook called Move. Facebook will invite third parties to build smart contracts
    and other blockchain-based services. The proposed idea to leverage upon the already
    global Facebook network, utilising a token which would be backed by financial
    assets including currencies and US Treasury securities in an attempt to mitigate
    issues with volatility, with substantial financial support to be provided by a
    variety of companies that have already offered their support to the idea. The
    Libra Association will thereby create new Libra currency units based on demand
    while previous currency units will be retired as they are redeemed for conventional
    currency. In the related white paper, it was proposed that the reconciliation
    of transactions will be performed at each service partner, and the blockchain’s
    distributed ledger will be used for reconciliation between service partners which
    would theoretically prevent an association member extracting and analysing the
    distributed ledger. In a May 2002 report in the Wall Street Journal, it was widely
    reported that there were a number of additional business models and benefits that
    Facebook was considering to be central to the creation of Libra, including: 1)
    a plan to launch a full payments network while the company had been reportedly
    in discussions with payment networks Visa and Mastercard, payments processors
    such as giant First Data as well as large e-commerce merchants to support the
    launch; 2) that Facebook had been the ability to generate up to $1 billion in
    investments collectively from associated firms to provide collateral to bolster
    and back the stablecoin that will be associated with the new payments network;
    3) the new coin will exist as the currency of the payments system in order to

- en: The announcement of Libra’s coincided with unprecedented scrutiny from regulators
    surrounding Facebook’s actions and behaviours across multiple fronts in recent
    years. The company has spent much time since 2017 battling to regain user trust
    after multiple privacy scandals, thereby experiencing much scepticism when Project
    Libra was initially announced. Since Libra’s unveiling, the project has received
    quite a negative reception from some policymakers. The United States Federal Reserve
    Chairman Jerome Powell signalled much scepticism about Facebook’s plans for Libra,
    stating that he did not ‘think that the project can go forward’ and that it was
    of the utmost importance that there be ‘broad satisfaction with the way the company
    has addressed money laundering’ during testimony before the House Financial Services
    Committee. Regulators had possessed ‘serious concerns’ with the project in its
    entirety when gauging its potential from the previous announcements. It has also
    not been identified as to whether money has actually changed hands from members
    who had expressed interest in the Libra association as some of the companies who
    agreed to lend their names to the project avoided making strong public statements
    in support of it. This very fact reflected significant uncertainty about how Libra
    will actually work and even if it is possible to launch a network like this within
    the bounds of international law, potentially explaining the reluctance for some
    companies to offer support. At the core of this project, Facebook is trying to
    build a payment system that combines the best characteristics of blockchain and
    conventional networks. But the result may wind up just being a contradictory and
    jurisdictional, regulatory and legislative disaster. Amongst one of the key issues
    is whether Libra will actually provide meaningful privacy to its users, particularly
    as Facebook’s plan incorporates delegating responsibility of the company’s network
    to its subsidiary Calibra, where Facebook executives have stated that Calibra
    will not share account holder’s purchase information with Facebook without authorisation.
    After the multiple privacy issues that have occurred in recent times, this is
    highly unlikely to lead to a positive response from users.

    minister Bruno Le Maire stated that the nation will not allow the development
    of the cryptocurrency in Europe as it is a threat to the monetary sovereignty
    of nations. He also spoke about the potential for abuse of marketing dominance
    and systemic financial risks as reasons for not allowing cryptocurrency in Europe.
    He announced that the French government refused to authorise the development ‘on
    the European soil’. He continued to state that ‘the monetary sovereignty of states
    is at stake. Any failure in the functioning of this currency, in the management
    of its reserves could create considerable financial disorders’. One of the major
    fears around the Libra is that it replaces the national currency in states where
    the currency is weak or experiencing a strong devaluation. There are also substantial
    fears that cryptocurrency escapes control over the financing of terrorism. In
    early August 2019, a joint statement by several regulators in charge of personal
    data protection, in the US, Europe, the UK, Canada and Australia, summoned the
    social network to give guarantees in this area. The EU’s competition authority
    subsequently begun investigating Libra, fearing ‘possible impediments to competition’.
    From a political standpoint, the United States House Committee on Financial Services
    Committee asked Facebook to halt the development and launch of Libra, citing a
    list of recent scandals and that ‘the cryptocurrency market currently lacks a
    clear regulatory framework’. Further, the US House Committee on Financial Services
    Democrats later sent a letter to Facebook asking the company to stop development
    of Libra, citing concerns of privacy, national security, trading, and monetary
    policy. In one of the most damning attacks on the planned cryptocurrency, Jerome
    Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on 10 July 2019
    that the Federal Reserve had ‘serious concerns’ as to how Libra would deal with
    ‘money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability’. It would be very
    much considered that the project, even after substantial development will face
    considerable opposition at all stages prior to establishment and throughout the
    process international regulatory alignment.

    exceeded 1,000,000% price inflation, otherwise identified as hyperinflation, combined
    with a premium of approximately 2,500% between its official currency, the bolivar,
    and a black-market exchange rate that has been thriving under the influence of
    those with access to the official rate at source. Throughout 2018, the Venezuelan
    government under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro have established a
    number of routes through which they could reduce the burden of economic collapse.
    Primarily, a new sovereign bolivar (bolivar soberano) was identified to replace
    the old bolivar (bolivar fuerte) at a conversion rate of 100,000:1, indicating
    that 100,000 old bolivars was the equivalent of US$1.5 cent.[²](#fn_35) Other
    countries with high levels of inflation, like Zimbabwe and Ecuador, have escaped
    by adopting the dollar, which would most likely be politically unacceptable for
    Mr Maduro’s regime. Zimbabwe pegged their economy to the US dollar when citizens
    refused to accept payments in the local currency. In Venezuela, which deprives
    people of access to dollars more effectively than did Zimbabwe (noting that the
    Zimbabwean economy underwent four rounds of redenomination and the printing of
    the $100 trillion bill before resorting to building a new currency), people could
    switch from the bolivar to the Petro.

    is no more convincing. The Petro is not yet itself exchangeable for oil. It is
    simply backed by a government’s guarantee that it is backed by oil. The very creation,
    advertisement and distribution of such a currency during a period of exceptional
    economic strife generated substantial concern about the credibility of this ground-breaking
    sovereign asset. The Petro’s pre-sale to investors began on 20 February 2018,
    where 38.4 million tokens were made available until 19 March 2018\. The Venezuelan
    government stated that US$3.3 billion was raised through the sale but this has
    yet to be independently verified. We must also note that one of the very characteristics
    of a cryptocurrency is that it be free of government intervention, explicitly
    decentralised from central bank authority.

- en: The introduction of the Petro is quite similar to the German government’s decision
    to introduce the Rentenmark to stem the growth of hyperinflation during the 1920s.
    The Rentemark was made stable through the backing of property used for agriculture
    and business, tangible products through which the German population could hold
    as security to underpin the value of the Papiermark. This is one of the key differences
    when observing the Petro and it’s underlying fulcrum. Without explicit backing,
    this product is simply driven by unsupported market sentiment, offering little
    for a population desperate for economic stability. Although not the first Venezuelan
    cryptocurrency, products such as Bolivarcoin, Onixcoin, Rilcoin and Perlacoin
    have preceded Petro, however, each have had little purchase internationally. When
    initially announced in December 2017 by President Maduro, one major concern was
    identified in this new cryptocurrency’s ability to circumvent US sanctions that
    had been implemented on the Venezuelan economy and their ability to access international
    financing. Officials of Iran and Russia have said their governments might be interested
    in issuing cryptocurrencies. The Marshall Islands announced that it would issue
    one, called the sovereign, that it will accept as legal tender. The Marshall Islands
    is a dollarised economy; a second currency would give it at least the illusion
    of greater control over its money. Iran and Russia are subject to American sanctions.
    The one common theme throughout these envisaged planned cryptocurrencies is a
    non-standard relationship between these countries and the economy of the United
    States. The US Department of the Treasury have explicitly warned that investor’s
    partaking in the initial coin offering of Petro would be in breach of such sanctions
    that have been imposed on countries such as Venezuela.

    opaque. A number of rating agencies, international economists and news agencies
    have all stated that this product is nothing more than a scam and a product to
    circumvent restrictions while providing false hope to a desperate population.
    The project has been identified as missing critical information, from the description
    of the mechanism to its technology and supposed oil-backing. The underlying technology
    supporting the product has been broadly challenged and has throughout 2018 changed
    substantially from that information provided in the Petro’s original white-paper.
    The principal platform for the coin is NEM, where accounts are anonymous, but
    can disclose their identities in the description of their coins if they wish.
    The Venezuelan government issued 82.4 million tokens from an NEM account in March
    2018 described as preliminary coins. The product has continued to evolve as a
    product who’s underlying structure remains fluid, but this is not a unique selling
    point, in fact, it would raise fears that there is a strong theme of desperation
    from economic collapse at the foundations of the necessity for this outlier sovereign
    product designed specifically to ‘petrolise’ salaries and prices. The Petro has
    also continued to obtain support from a number of international exchanges. Hong
    Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest exchanges by volume, in March
    said it never intended to list the Petro due to its ‘limited utility.’ The only
    exchange that has publicly discussed plans to list the Petro is India’s Coinsecure.
    As of late 2018, the product remains un-traded. The technology behind the coin
    is said to be in development while nobody has been able to make use of the Petro
    despite claims of substantial investment at the time of the ICO. Further, a number
    of international journalist who have contacted the Venezuelan government for comment
    remain unanswered while the Superintendence’s website is unresponsive. In August
    2018, President Maduro announced that salaries, pensions and the exchange rate
    for the bolivar would be pegged to the Petro, thereby underpinning the economy
    to the simplistic assumption that one barrel of oil (priced at approximately $66
    at the time that this peg had taken place, backed with crude oil reserves located
    in a 380-square-kilometre area surrounding Atapirire[⁴](#fn_37)) is equivalent
    to one Petro. This statement and the precarious nature of this sovereign cryptocurrency
    presented a strong signal of the desperation that had now taken over, that a government
    would simply rest their economic future (although already bleak) on an exceptionally
    high-risk, high-volatility, untested, unverified and most likely illegal product.

    the cryptocurrency market through the creation of KODAKOne, described as a revolutionary
    new image rights management and protection platform secured in the blockchain.
    Kodak announced that its development seamlessly registers, manages and monetises
    creative assets for the photographic community ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_012)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_012))). It would be used to underpin the assured
    buying and selling of rights-cleared and protected digital assets while ensuring
    transparency. The announcement had a significant sharp impact on volatility (which
    peaked at over 60% per day) with shares increasing from over $3 per share to over
    $12 in less than one week. This was associated with an increase in market sentiment
    and research using terms such as ‘Kodak’ and ‘KODAKCoin’. Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke
    said in a press statement, ‘For many in the technology industry, ‘blockchain’
    and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled
    to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys
    to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem.’ In theory, photographers will
    be able to upload their images to a platform called KodakOne, create a blockchain-based
    license for each image, and use web-crawling software to scour the Internet looking
    for copyright violations. Instead of using dollars, photographers can have clients
    pay them in KODAKCoins. However, there are many analysts and market-commentators
    alike that continue to identify Kodak’s strategy as a technique to capitalise
    on the current cryptocurrency frenzy or is it indeed a valid evolutionary characteristic
    of blockchain.

    indicate a substantial and sustained increase in return volatility in the period
    after the announcement of Kodak’s intention to create a cryptocurrency. Such announcements
    can potentially take advantage of the euphoric and speculative investment motives
    that have been inflating what some consider to be a significant bubble in cryptocurrency
    markets. Announcements without strong supporting evidence can present an channel
    through which speculative contagion can flow from cryptocurrency markets to equity
    markets. The definition provided by the US Securities and Exchange Commission
    for a ‘pump-and-dump’ specifically comes to mind, that often occur on the Internet
    where it is common to see messages posted that urge readers to buy a stock quickly
    or to sell before the price goes down, or a telemarketer will call using the same
    sort of pitch. Often the promoters will claim to have ‘inside’ information about
    an impending development or to use an ‘infallible’ combination of economic and
    stock market data to pick stocks. In reality, they may be company insiders or
    paid promoters who stand to gain by selling their shares after the stock price
    is ‘pumped’ up by the buying frenzy they create. Once these fraudsters ‘dump’
    their shares and stop hyping the stock, the price typically falls, and investors
    lose their money. These ‘sudden’ cryptocurrency announcements have also attracted
    the attention of regulators. Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC), said that the agency was ‘looking closely at the disclosures
    of public companies that shift their business models to capitalise on the perceived
    promise of distributed ledger technology.’ However, Kodak then decided to delay
    the ICO of KODAKCoin in an attempt to verify accredited status of approximately
    40,000 potential investors. The SEC requires that an individual accredited investor
    has a net worth that exceeds $1 million, or an annual income of at least $200,000,
    along with other conditions. The company claims it needs ‘several weeks’ to verify
    the ‘accredited investors’ status of those who applied to invest in the ICO. Potential
    investors from outside the US would then be considered in accordance with their
    local jurisdictions. But one key point that can be taken from the case of Kodak
    is that it’s price, two months later, remained elevated by almost 100% of that
    from early January 2018\. Even without the implementation of an ICO, the announcement
    of a cryptocurrency related plan has potentially incorporated any cryptocurrency
    speculation into the share price of a publicly traded company. This is a point
    of concern for regulators and policy-makers alike.

    cryptocurrency into their non-cryptocurrency-related business practices, there
    have also been a number of companies that have gone one-step further and attempted
    to change their names to identify as a cryptocurrency-related company. This is
    even more astonishing as some of these companies for the most-part had no prior
    interaction with any form of IT or technological development. In a detailed analysis
    investigating both the financial market effects and the theoretical grounding
    or indeed ethical support surrounding such decisions, [Akyildirim et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_003)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_003)) found that thirty-one companies are identified
    to have partaken in ‘crypto-exuberant’ naming behaviour. In 2015 and 2016, there
    are only two companies, NXChain and First Bitcoin Capital that change their names,
    previous known as AgriVest Americas and Grand Paracaraima Gold respectively. In
    2017, there are twelve companies who then change their names, and eleven in 2018\.
    When comparing the companies who had partaken in crypto-exuberant company announcements,
    those who have utilised cryptocurrency and blockchain when naming are found to
    have on average higher returns, yet more volatile returns with mean returns of
    −0.0081% and a standard deviation of 5.1575%. Further, such companies exhibit
    far more substantial extreme returns (where evidence is provided of one-day price
    decreases of 52.8% and increases of 57.7% when compared to −15.9% and 16.9% in
    non-cryptocurrency companies respectively), further associated with skewness and
    kurtosis in excess of three times that of other non-cryptocurrency-based company
    names. Such a result indicates that companies that partake in the use of cryptocurrency-based
    naming practices are found to be substantially riskier shares to purchase when
    compared to other companies that have changed their corporate name for other types
    of reasons.

    their name twice, in both cases from a non-crypto-exuberant name to a crypto-exuberant
    name and then back again. In August 2018, Focused Capital II Corp announced its
    intention on the TSX Venture Exchange to change its name to Fortress Blockchain
    Corp, clearly positioning its corporate identity to be further associated with
    the growing blockchain and cryptocurrency markets. During this transaction, the
    company issued 71.2 million common shares and signalled its intention to begin
    trading on the TSXV under the ticker ‘FORT’. In a largely unanticipated move,
    in April 2019, Fortress Blockchain then applied to the TSX Venture Exchange to
    change its name to Fortress Technologies Inc while continuing to use the same
    ticker. This situation is the only identified case within the dataset of a company
    retracting on its decision to partake in crypto-exuberant behaviour. However,
    Long Island Iced Tea Corp. remains as one of the most famous companies to employ
    a crypto-exuberant naming strategy when changing their corporate identity to Long
    Blockchain Corp in 2017\. The stock price then sharply increased almost 300% stating
    that it was ‘shifting its primary corporate focus’ from tea to distributed-ledger
    technology. In 2019, it has been announced through warrants in the United States
    that the FBI is looking for evidence of insider trading and securities fraud connected
    to Long Island Iced Tea stock, where two men related to a separate company, were
    arrested for securities fraud. There have also been broad accusations about the
    presence of a ‘pump-and-dump’ scheme, where promoters buy a cheap stock, start
    hyping it to investors with eye-catching claims, then sell their own holdings
    during the resulting mania, hopefully securing a profit before the stock comes
    crashing down. Based on a number of text messages that the FBI have since uncovered,
    they are interested in a person known as ‘Eric W’ in a series of messages, where
    the accused person owned approximately 15% of the shares in Long Island Iced Tea
    at the time that the company’s name was changed. There is further investigation
    into the use of an investor relations program to develop hype around the company
    during this time. Riot Blockchain has also been investigated throughout 2018 and
    2019 by the SEC. It had previously changed its name from Bioptix, where its previous
    business practices was based on the development of veterinary products patent
    and developing new ways to test for disease.

    ICOs have experienced in recent times, including that of moral hazard, adverse
    selection, insider trading and market manipulation amongst others, and the very
    fact that participants have been continuously proven to have acted out outside
    existing regulatory frameworks, have caused much distrust within the broad ICO
    market. In many cases there was an absence of due diligence, standardised financial
    reporting, prospectuses containing the main risk factors of the company and its
    businesses and broad corporate governance. Instead, many fund providers to these
    projects released whitepapers with poor information, in some cases omitting the
    name of the company or its address, however, focusing on marketing techniques,
    even in some cases using celebrities in an almost tactical capacity to distract
    investors. The first responses from national regulators around the world focused
    on warnings and guidance while providing thorough investigations with reports
    and outright bans (such as that seen in China in September 2017). Most regulators
    would agree that although ICOs are currently not governed by specific regulations,
    the broad practices of many ICOs might already fall under existing legal and jurisdictional
    coverage. Recently, it has been discussed that some ICOs might actually be contained

    has somewhat alarmed cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. In the past, the rapidly expanding
    ICO landscape resembled a free for all, where the most talented and knowledgeable
    appear to have been taking funds from the most vulnerable who were seeking quick
    profit. The negative media coverage on cryptocurrency criminality has most certainly
    attracted the attention of regulatory authorities. The effect of increased scrutiny
    by authorities has been to multiply regulatory barriers for entrepreneurs aspiring
    to begin an ICO. However, this has generated some confusion. There has been considerable
    controversy over the status of utility tokens, which require fewer disclosure
    forms and checks from the SEC and which are favoured by most startups opting for
    an ICO. The SEC were seen to have adequately forewarned cryptocurrency startups
    when asserted that most ICO tokens would require greater disclosure, the first
    time that the commission had clarified its stance regarding ICOs. The increased
    level of regulation for a security token sale appears to have made ICOs costlier
    while taking more time as compared to an ICO for utility tokens, where the average
    cost is estimated to be between $1 million and $3 million for a security token
    sale. Private sales to accredited investors also shift costs of conducting a public
    ICO. Entrepreneurs have increasingly begun issuing a bonus (or discount) on their
    tokens to private investors.

- en: In this chapter, we provide a thorough account of the key issues that have engulfed
    the ICO market in recent years, somewhat stifling the growth of illicit cryptocurrency
    auctions, but further failing to eliminate the issue completely. A central theme
    throughout these listed issues and examples surrounds substantial damage to credibility
    within the market. We have observed cases of theft at the level of the exchange,
    within the whitepapers that have been provided, through the usage of celebrities
    to support marketing tactics, through the illegal cross-jurisdictional transfer
    of funds and indeed, the most simplest form of theft, where the ICO counter-party
    quite simply disappears with the accumulated assets of investors. While cryptocurrency-enthusiasts
    continue to promote the positive attributes that support the potential growth
    of this new investment asset, the same proponents cannot ignore that this entire
    sector has been rampant with levels and styles of fraudulent behaviour that is
    quite difficult to find in other international markets of similar scale and scope.
    But there have been significant positive developments in terms of the future scope
    of international regulation and the potential to eliminate fraudulent behaviour.
    It is essential that during the continued growth of the sector for cryptocurrencies
    that regulation, including a broad international set of standards, be developed
    and maintained to grow at pace with the market for cryptocurrencies. It is essential
    that regulations must compare effectively with the sophistication of the market
    that they attempt to monitor. Until the broad gap between regulation and the capacity
    for cryptocurrency market misuse is diminished, there will continue to be substantial
    and frequent loss of investor assets through mechanisms that represent those usually
    observed in an exceptionally juvenile market.
