  zh: 1 引言
- en: 'As with any juvenile and rapidly expanding financial product, we must be aware
    of the potential for illicit and ethically-challenging decision-making while the
    boundaries for regulation continue to be designed. The very creation of cryptocurrencies
    has somewhat challenged regulators. Cryptocurrencies have provided an exceptionally
    easy platform that can be used for cross-border trade, but they can easily generate
    illicit activity. Companies and governments alike can utilise these products for
    somewhat ‘questionable’ practices. Three specific key concerns have been identified
    in recent literature: 1) the use of cryptocurrencies by governments to circumvent
    internationally-binding sanctions and controls; 2) the announcement of companies
    of their broad intentions to enter the cryptocurrency market, with little or no
    intention of following through on their commitments; and 3) the simplistic nature
    through which investor theft has continued to escalate within the scope of unregulated
    ICOs. These situations necessitate broad consideration by regulators and policy-makers
    before the markets for cryptocurrencies can be truly identified to have evolved
    to levels similar to that of other types of traditional markets.'

  zh: 与任何幼稚且快速扩张的金融产品一样，在我们继续设计监管边界的同时，我们必须警惕潜在的非法和道德挑战性决策。加密货币的创建本身在一定程度上挑战了监管机构。加密货币为跨境贸易提供了异常简单的平台，但它们可以轻易地产生非法活动。公司和政府可以利用这些产品进行某种“可疑”的做法。近期文献中确定了三个具体的关键担忧：1)政府使用加密货币规避国际制裁和控制；2)公司宣布他们打算进入加密货币市场，却几乎没有意愿履行他们的承诺；以及3)投资者盗窃在未受监管的ICO范围内继续升级的简单性质。这些情况需要监管机构和政策制定者进行广泛的考虑，然后加密货币市场才能真正被认为是发展到与其他传统市场相似的水平。
- en: There have been a number of ethically-challenged issues that have arisen since
    the establishment of Bitcoin and other growing cryptocurrencies and digital asset
    types. Regulatory bodies and policy-makers alike have observed the growth of cryptocurrencies
    with a certain amount of scepticism based on the growing potential for illegality
    and malpractice through the use of cryptocurrencies. Some regulatory authorities,
    including the International Monetary Fund, have expressed their satisfaction with
    the product’s development and the benefits that are contained within its continued
    growth, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) amongst other international
    authorities have explicitly warned of the potential market manipulation techniques
    and ability to utilise fraudulent methods to defraud and steal from unwilling
    and unsuspecting investors.

- en: Research based on ICOs has developed substantially since 2018, focusing on a
    broad number of areas such as underlying technology, financing and governance.
    It is notable that a developing strand of research has began to focus on issues
    such as illicit usage of ICOs and the developing role that cybercriminality has
    begun to play at the point at which cryptocurrencies begin their existence. [Adhami
    et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_001) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_001)) analysed
    the determinants of the success 253 ICOs to find that the probability success
    is higher if the code source is made available, when a token presale is organized,
    and when tokens allow contributors to access a specific service (or to share profits).
    While [Hashemi Joo et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_023) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_023))
    identify that ICOs have generated billions of dollars of funding to startups and
    projects worldwide in less than two years, many successful ICOs yielded extremely
    high returns to investors. While the ICO is a revolutionary vehicle for business
    funding, it has raised concerns among users as well as potential investors about
    its risk and lack of regulation. The future of this innovative funding method
    highly depends on further development and placement of appropriate regulatory
    supervision, better understanding of risk and benefits and attaining the confidence
    of users. [Deng et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_017) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_017))
    focused on the September 2017 decision to ban ICOs in Chine, noting that the decision
    could hamper revolutionary technological developments and dampen the growth of
    this potentially beneficial market. The authors provide a non-exhaustive classification
    of the legal status of ICOs, including the pre-sale of products or services, offering
    of shares, issue of debentures, issue of derivatives, collective investment schemes
    and crowdfunding, as well as a possible regulatory reform of the current ICO ban
    in China. It is concluded that ICOs could be best regarded as pre-sale of products
    or services, whereas, the other five types of ICOs are highly likely to be considered
    as financial securities and thus should be subject to securities laws. [O’Dair
    and Owen](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_029) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_029))
    went as far as to investigate as to how new music ventures might obtain alternative
    entrepreneurial finance through token sales or ICOs, presenting evidence as to
    the breadth that this new developing market can reach. [Fisch](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_019)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_019)) assessed the determinants of the amount
    raised in 423 ICOs while drawing on signalling theory to show that technical white
    papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents
    are not associated with increased amounts of funding. The results indicate that
    some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research
    into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. [Felix
    and von Eije](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_018) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_018))
    found that the average level of under-pricing of ICOs of 123% in the US and 97%
    in the other countries. The results for the US ICOs are significantly higher than
    for US IPOs on average and also higher than US IPOs at the beginning of the dot.com
    bubble. The authors also study the determinants of ICO under-pricing. Further,
    companies that use a large issue size or a pre-ICO (a sale of cryptocurrencies
    before the ICO) leave less money on the table.

  zh: 自2018年以来，基于ICO的研究有了显著发展，主要关注底层技术、融资和治理等多个领域。值得注意的是，一个新的研究线索开始关注ICO的非法使用等问题，以及网络犯罪在加密货币诞生时开始扮演的不断发展角色。[Adhami等人](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_001)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_001))分析了253个ICO成功的决定因素，发现如果公开源代码、组织代币预售以及代币允许贡献者访问特定服务（或分享利润）时，成功的可能性会更高。而[Hashemi
    Joo等人](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_023) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_023))指出，在不到两年的时间里，ICO为全球初创企业和项目筹集了数十亿美元资金，许多成功的ICO为投资者带来了极高的回报。尽管ICO是革命性的商业融资工具，但其风险和缺乏监管引起了用户和潜在投资者的担忧。这种创新融资方法的未来高度依赖于进一步的发展和适当的监管监督，更好地理解风险和收益，并赢得用户的信心。[Deng等人](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_017)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_017))关注了2017年9月中国禁止ICO的决定，指出这一决定可能会阻碍革命性的技术发展，并抑制这一潜在有益市场的发展。作者提供了非详尽的ICO法律地位分类，包括产品或服务的预售、股份发行、债券发行、衍生品发行、集体投资计划和众筹，以及中国当前ICO禁令的可能的监管改革。结论是，ICO最适合被视为产品或服务的预售，而其他五种ICO类型很可能会被视为金融证券，因此应受到证券法的约束。[O’Dair和Owen](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_029)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_029))甚至调查了新的音乐企业如何通过代币销售或ICO获得替代的企业融资，展示了这个新兴市场可以达到的广度。[Fisch](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_019)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_019))评估了423个ICO中筹集的资金量的决定因素，同时借鉴信号理论表明，技术白皮书和高质量源代码增加了筹集的资金量，而专利与增加的资金量无显著关联。结果显示，ICO的一些潜在机制与先前的企业融资研究发现的机制相似，而其他机制是ICO背景下的独特现象。[Felix和von
    Eije](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_018) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_018))发现，在美国，ICO的平均折价水平为123%，在其他国家为97%。美国ICO的结果显著高于美国平均的IPO，也高于互联网泡沫初期美国的IPO。作者还研究了ICO折价的决定因素。此外，使用大发行量或预售ICO（ICO之前的加密货币销售）的公司留下的钱更少。

    found that many ICOs failed even to promise that they would protect investors
    against insider self-dealing and that a significant fraction of issuers retained
    centralised control through previously undisclosed code permitting modification
    of the entities’ governing structures. [Barone and Masciandaro](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_004)

    among them (model parameters). [Huang et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_024) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_024))

    that ICOs take place more frequently in countries with developed financial systems,
    public equity markets, and advanced digital technologies. The availability of
    investment-based crowdfunding platforms is also positively associated with the
    emergence of ICOs, while debt and private equity markets do not provide similar
    effects. Further, countries with ICO-friendly regulations have more ICOs, whereas
    tax regimes are not clearly related to ICOs. [Chen](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_006)

    in different ICO stages to investigate the relations between signal processing
    and information asymmetry. The authors find differing results throughout the different
    stages analysed, first indicating that in the crowd sale stage, high credible
    and easy-interpretable signals have significant influences on token sales. In
    the listing stage, low credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant
    effects on token trading. High credible and hard-interpretable signals, which
    deliver project fundamental information, lose their functions in both stages,
    causing information asymmetry in ICOs. Further, investor comments on social media,

    and businesses highlighting the importance of full and fair disclosure of corporate
    intention to incorporate blockchain technology. While ICOs can help companies
    to reduce the costs of raising capital, the lack of transparency and very limited
    information available for investors in the white papers might affect the corporate
    performance in the long run. The absence of a unified regulatory framework creates
    multiple speculation opportunities for all market players. At corporate level,
    the decision to adopt cryptocurrency or blockchain technology can change the corporate
    identity of the firm, for example, from a more conventional identity to that of
    a Fintech company, and attract a new group of investors. However, those intentions
    to adopt blockchain often stays at the stage of writing a white paper, making
    corporate announcements, or even simply changing the name of corporation, and
    not going further to actually launching the stated cryptocurrency or building
    the proposed platform. Thus corporations may try to take advantage of the euphoric
    and speculative investment motives and ride a wave on the cryptocurrency bubble.
    The explosive behaviour of the cryptocurrency markets can be compared with Dot.com
    bubble and related corporate name changes ([Cooper et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_008)

  zh: 初始代币发行（ICO）的一个有争议的领域涉及到金融监管机构和企业强调公司意向全面且公正地披露融入区块链技术的重要性。尽管ICO可以帮助公司降低筹集资本的成本，但白皮书中对投资者可获得的信息透明度低和非常有限，可能会对公司的长期表现产生影响。缺乏统一的监管框架为所有市场参与者创造了多种投机机会。在企业层面，采用加密货币或区块链技术的决定可以改变公司的企业身份，例如，从更传统的身份转变为金融科技（Fintech）公司，并吸引一组新的投资者。然而，这些采用区块链的意图通常停留在撰写白皮书、发布企业公告，甚至仅仅是更改公司名称的阶段，并没有进一步实际启动所述加密货币或构建拟议的平台。因此，公司可能试图利用狂热和投机的投资动机，乘上加密货币泡沫的浪潮。加密货币市场的爆炸性行为可以与.com泡沫及相关的企业名称变更相比较([Cooper等人](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_008)

    in cryptocurrency markets is denoted within not only the number of Initial Coin
    Offerings (ICOs) in recent years (see [Figure 1](#b_9783110660807-007_fig_001)),
    but indeed the source of these coin offerings. A substantial number of corporate
    entities have made announcements with regards to their intentions to enter the
    cryptocurrency sphere, for a host of differing reasons. This has raised alarm
    due to the inherent dangers associated with asymmetric information and moral hazard.
    As with any new financial product, we must be aware of the potential for illicit
    and ethically-challenging decision-making as the boundaries of regulation are
    designed. The very creation of cryptocurrencies has somewhat challenged regulators.
    Cryptocurrencies have provided an exceptionally easy platform that can be used
    for cross-border trade and generally illicit activity. Companies and governments
    alike can utilise these products for ‘questionable’ practices. Two key concerns
    have been identified: 1) the use of cryptocurrencies by governments to circumvent
    internationally-binding sanctions and controls; and 2) the announcement of companies
    of their broad intentions to enter the cryptocurrency market, however, with little
    or no intention of following through on their commitments. Both of these situations
    necessitate broad consideration by regulators and policy-makers. Regulatory bodies
    and policy-makers alike have observed the growth of cryptocurrencies with a certain
    amount of scepticism, based on this growing potential for illegality and malpractice.

- en: However, at the core of the main issue with ICOs is simply that of direct theft,
    which has occurred on multiple occasions, including the most simplistic of financial
    crime, where the host of the ICO simply disappears. Unfortunately, this type of
    scam has become far too common in recent times. Amongst the most well-known is
    that of Pincoin, representing one of the largest ICO scam in history. Together
    with Ifan, another blockchain company, 32,000 investors were duped out of the
    equivalent of $660 million. The company had promised its investors a 40% monthly
    returns on their investment, luring unsuspecting investors with claims that the
    ICO was to be overseen by PIN Foundation. Further, Modern Tech promised an 8%
    reward to every investor for bringing in another investor, indicative of a classic
    multi-level-marketing scheme with the benefit of hindsight. Titanium was another
    example of a textbook ICO case of fraud. The ICO was based on a social media marketing
    blitz that allegedly deceived investors with purely fictional claims of business
    prospects. Charges were then filed against Michael Alan Stollery, a self-described
    blockchain evangelist, who is reported to have lied about business relationships
    with the Federal Reserve and dozens of well-known firms, including PayPal, Verizon,
    Boeing, and The Walt Disney Company. The complaint alleges that Titanium’s website
    contained fabricated testimonials from corporate customers. As evidence of the
    sharp perceptions and actions of regulatory authorities, the Titanium ICO was
    stopped before it was finished.

  zh: 然而，ICO的主要问题核心简单来说就是直接盗窃，这种情况已经发生了多次，包括最简单的金融犯罪，即ICO的主持人 simply disappears。不幸的是，这种骗局在最近变得过于普遍。其中最著名的是Pincoin，代表了历史上最大的ICO骗局之一。与Ifan等其他区块链公司一起，32,000名投资者被骗走了相当于6.6亿美元的资金。该公司向投资者承诺，他们的投资将每月获得40%的回报，以PIN
    Foundation将监督ICO的说法吸引了不知情的投资者。此外，Modern Tech还承诺，每位介绍新投资者的投资者将获得8%的奖励，这表明了一种典型的多层次营销方案。Titanium是另一个典型的ICO欺诈案例。该ICO基于一场社会媒体营销活动，据称该活动向投资者提出了完全是虚构的商业前景。随后，针对自我描述为区块链传教士的Michael
    Alan Stollery提起诉讼，他被报道关于与联邦储备银行和数十家知名公司，包括PayPal、Verizon、Boeing和华特迪士尼公司的商业关系撒了谎。投诉称，Titanium的网站上包含了来自企业客户的伪造推荐信。作为监管机构敏锐洞察和行动的证据，Titanium的ICO在结束之前被制止了。

    the OneCoin operation in the country. The company claimed to be officially licensed
    in Vietnam, but this was later refuted by the country’s government. More than
    five countries have warned investors of the risks involved for those choosing
    to invest in the company, including Thailand, Croatia, Bulgaria, Finland and Norway.
    In 2017, another example of substantial ICO fraud was that of Confido, who had
    collected 1235 Ethereum, at the time valued at approximately $375,000 before the
    price of tokens became tradable and their value subsequently skyrocketed. At one
    point, the price of one CFD token rose approximately that of twenty times the
    amount of the initial ICO price. This price jump made Confido one of the best-performing
    ICOs ever in terms of short-term token price rise, and the tiny project possessed
    a market cap of $10 million in a very short amount of time. However, a number
    of market monitors had raised suspicions based on the lack of credibility and
    the continued anonymity of those responsible. Thereafter, a message on Confido’s
    subreddit said that the company is having unspecified legal problems which will
    delay development ‘until a resolution is found.’ Shortly after, the value of CFD
    had collapsed to $0.03 and all associated had become non-responsive.

    filed for creditor protection in compliance with the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement
    Act (CCAA). The exchange only has CA$375,000 in cash, while it owed approximately
    CA$260 million to its users. The exchange kept most its assets in offline storage
    systems called cold wallets, which are secured by digital security keys in order
    to protect them from hacking and theft. Cotten was solely responsible for the
    wallets and corresponding keys, which the company has been trying to find after
    his passing.[¹](#fn_34) The company’s auditors raised substantial, ongoing suspicions

- en: 'One of the largest ICO-related announcements in recent times surrounded that
    of Project Libra, which is a proposed digital currency by that of Facebook with
    an estimated launch date during 2020\. The project, currency and transactions
    are to be managed and cryptographically entrusted to the Libra Association, which
    was founded by Facebook’s subsidiary Calibra and a number of other companies across
    payment, technology, telecommunication, online marketplace, venture capital and
    nonprofits. It was first rumoured in May 2019 that Facebook had been secretly
    planning to release a cryptocurrency, with names reported such as GlobalCoin and
    Facebook Coin. The new coin is not proposed to be decentralised, thereby firmly
    relying on trust in the Libra Association as a lender of last resort. The company
    also announced a new digital wallet called Calibra, which will be operated by
    Facebook as a separate subsidiary and provide users with a way to store and spend
    Libra. Facebook provided an image of Calibra’s design, including a three-wave
    symbol that serves as the Libra’s equivalent of a dollar sign. The currency’s
    blockchain, which is open source, will be programmed in a new language developed
    by Facebook called Move. Facebook will invite third parties to build smart contracts
    and other blockchain-based services. The proposed idea to leverage upon the already
    global Facebook network, utilising a token which would be backed by financial
    assets including currencies and US Treasury securities in an attempt to mitigate
    issues with volatility, with substantial financial support to be provided by a
    variety of companies that have already offered their support to the idea. The
    Libra Association will thereby create new Libra currency units based on demand
    while previous currency units will be retired as they are redeemed for conventional
    currency. In the related white paper, it was proposed that the reconciliation
    of transactions will be performed at each service partner, and the blockchain’s
    distributed ledger will be used for reconciliation between service partners which
    would theoretically prevent an association member extracting and analysing the
    distributed ledger. In a May 2002 report in the Wall Street Journal, it was widely
    reported that there were a number of additional business models and benefits that
    Facebook was considering to be central to the creation of Libra, including: 1)
    a plan to launch a full payments network while the company had been reportedly
    in discussions with payment networks Visa and Mastercard, payments processors
    such as giant First Data as well as large e-commerce merchants to support the
    launch; 2) that Facebook had been the ability to generate up to $1 billion in
    investments collectively from associated firms to provide collateral to bolster
    and back the stablecoin that will be associated with the new payments network;
    3) the new coin will exist as the currency of the payments system in order to
    eliminate credit card fees for merchants as well as to avoid the volatility of
    other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether; and 4) the new coin could potentially
    be tied to Facebook’s core advertisement engine, thereby rewarding users for viewing
    advertisements and then purchasing goods, similar to how loyalty points rewards

  zh: 近期最大的一个与ICO相关的公告是围绕Project Libra项目的，这是由Facebook提出的一种拟议中的数字货币，预计将在2020年推出。这个项目、货币和交易将由Libra
    Association进行管理和加密委托，该协会由Facebook的子公司Calibra和其他一些公司共同创立，这些公司涵盖支付、技术、电信、在线市场、风险投资和非盈利领域。2019年5月首次传言Facebook一直在秘密计划推出一种加密货币，据报道其名称为GlobalCoin和Facebook
    Coin。这种新币不是拟议中的去中心化，因此坚定地依赖于对Libra Association作为最后贷款人的信任。该公司还宣布了一种名为Calibra的新数字钱包，将由Facebook作为独立子公司运营，为用户提供存储和花费Libra的方式。Facebook提供了一张Calibra设计的图片，包括一个三波符号，作为Libra的美元符号的等价物。这种货币的区块链是开源的，将用Facebook开发的一种新语言Move编程。Facebook将邀请第三方建立智能合约和其他基于区块链的服务。拟议的想法是利用已经全球的Facebook网络，使用一种由金融资产支持，包括货币和美国的国债证券的代币，以试图减轻波动性的问题，并提供大量金融支持，这些公司已经表示支持这个想法。Libra
    Association将根据需求创建新的Libra货币单位，而之前的货币单位将在兑换成传统货币时退役。在相关的白皮书文件中，提议交易对账将在每个服务合作伙伴处执行，而区块链的分布式账本将用于服务合作伙伴之间的对账，从理论上防止协会成员提取和分析分布式账本。在2002年5月华尔街日报的一份报告中，广泛报道了Facebook正在考虑的一些与Libra创建相关的商业模型和好处，包括：1)
    计划启动一个完整的支付网络，而公司据报道已经与支付网络Visa和Mastercard进行了讨论，与支付处理商First Data以及大型电子商务商户支持启动；2)
    Facebook已经能够从相关公司共同产生高达10亿美元的总投资，为即将与新支付网络关联的稳定币提供抵押；3) 这种新币将作为支付系统的货币，以消除商家的信用卡费用，以及避免像比特币和以太坊等其他加密货币的波动；以及4)
    这种新币可能会与Facebook的核心广告引擎相关联，从而奖励用户查看广告并购买商品，类似于忠诚度积分奖励的工作方式。
- en: The announcement of Libra’s coincided with unprecedented scrutiny from regulators
    surrounding Facebook’s actions and behaviours across multiple fronts in recent
    years. The company has spent much time since 2017 battling to regain user trust
    after multiple privacy scandals, thereby experiencing much scepticism when Project
    Libra was initially announced. Since Libra’s unveiling, the project has received
    quite a negative reception from some policymakers. The United States Federal Reserve
    Chairman Jerome Powell signalled much scepticism about Facebook’s plans for Libra,
    stating that he did not ‘think that the project can go forward’ and that it was
    of the utmost importance that there be ‘broad satisfaction with the way the company
    has addressed money laundering’ during testimony before the House Financial Services
    Committee. Regulators had possessed ‘serious concerns’ with the project in its
    entirety when gauging its potential from the previous announcements. It has also
    not been identified as to whether money has actually changed hands from members
    who had expressed interest in the Libra association as some of the companies who
    agreed to lend their names to the project avoided making strong public statements
    in support of it. This very fact reflected significant uncertainty about how Libra
    will actually work and even if it is possible to launch a network like this within
    the bounds of international law, potentially explaining the reluctance for some
    companies to offer support. At the core of this project, Facebook is trying to
    build a payment system that combines the best characteristics of blockchain and
    conventional networks. But the result may wind up just being a contradictory and
    jurisdictional, regulatory and legislative disaster. Amongst one of the key issues
    is whether Libra will actually provide meaningful privacy to its users, particularly
    as Facebook’s plan incorporates delegating responsibility of the company’s network
    to its subsidiary Calibra, where Facebook executives have stated that Calibra
    will not share account holder’s purchase information with Facebook without authorisation.
    After the multiple privacy issues that have occurred in recent times, this is
    highly unlikely to lead to a positive response from users.

  zh: Libra的发布与Facebook在过去几年在多个领域所采取的行动和行为受到了前所未有的监管审查同时发生。自2017年以来，这家公司花费了大量时间试图在多次隐私丑闻之后恢复用户的信任，因此在Project
    Libra最初公布时遭遇了很多怀疑。自从Libra公布以来，这个项目在一些政策制定者那里得到了相当负面的反响。美国联邦储备银行主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔对Facebook的Libra计划表达了很大的怀疑，表示他不认为这个项目“可以继续进行”，并指出公司对洗钱问题的处理方式必须得到“广泛满意”至关重要，这是在众议院金融服务委员会作证时说的。在评估其潜力时，监管机构对整个项目持有“严重关切”。同时，也没有迹象表明有兴趣加入Libra协会的成员之间是否真的发生了资金流动，因为一些同意为该项目提供名字的公司避免发表强烈的公开支持声明。这一事实反映出对Libra实际运作方式以及是否可能在国际法的范围内启动此类网络的重大不确定性，这可能解释了一些公司不愿提供支持的原因。在这个项目的核心，Facebook试图建立一个结合了区块链和传统网络最佳特性的支付系统。但结果可能最终只是一个矛盾且具有管辖权、监管和立法灾难。其中的关键问题之一是Libra是否会为其用户提供有意义的隐私保护，特别是Facebook的计划包括将公司网络的责任委托给其子公司Calibra，Facebook高管表示，Calibra未经授权不会与Facebook共享账户持有人的购买信息。在最近发生的多次隐私问题之后，这不太可能引发用户的积极反应。
- en: The European response has been far more damning. In September 2019, French finance
    minister Bruno Le Maire stated that the nation will not allow the development
    of the cryptocurrency in Europe as it is a threat to the monetary sovereignty
    of nations. He also spoke about the potential for abuse of marketing dominance
    and systemic financial risks as reasons for not allowing cryptocurrency in Europe.
    He announced that the French government refused to authorise the development ‘on
    the European soil’. He continued to state that ‘the monetary sovereignty of states
    is at stake. Any failure in the functioning of this currency, in the management
    of its reserves could create considerable financial disorders’. One of the major
    fears around the Libra is that it replaces the national currency in states where
    the currency is weak or experiencing a strong devaluation. There are also substantial
    fears that cryptocurrency escapes control over the financing of terrorism. In
    early August 2019, a joint statement by several regulators in charge of personal
    data protection, in the US, Europe, the UK, Canada and Australia, summoned the
    social network to give guarantees in this area. The EU’s competition authority
    subsequently begun investigating Libra, fearing ‘possible impediments to competition’.
    From a political standpoint, the United States House Committee on Financial Services
    Committee asked Facebook to halt the development and launch of Libra, citing a
    list of recent scandals and that ‘the cryptocurrency market currently lacks a
    clear regulatory framework’. Further, the US House Committee on Financial Services
    Democrats later sent a letter to Facebook asking the company to stop development
    of Libra, citing concerns of privacy, national security, trading, and monetary
    policy. In one of the most damning attacks on the planned cryptocurrency, Jerome
    Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on 10 July 2019
    that the Federal Reserve had ‘serious concerns’ as to how Libra would deal with
    ‘money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability’. It would be very
    much considered that the project, even after substantial development will face
    considerable opposition at all stages prior to establishment and throughout the
    process international regulatory alignment.

  zh: 欧洲的回应要严厉得多。2019年9月，法国财政部长布鲁诺·勒梅雷表示，该国不会允许加密货币在欧洲发展，因为它对国家货币主权构成威胁。他还谈到了市场营销主导地位的潜在滥用和系统性金融风险，这些原因是禁止加密货币在欧洲的原因。他宣布，法国政府拒绝授权在欧洲土地上发展。他继续表示，“国家货币主权”面临威胁。“这种货币的任何功能失败，在其储备管理中可能造成相当大的金融混乱”。围绕Libra的主要担忧之一是，它可能会取代那些货币疲软或经历剧烈贬值的国家中的国家货币。还有充分的理由担心，加密货币逃避了对恐怖主义融资的控制。2019年8月初，美国、欧洲、英国、加拿大和澳大利亚负责个人数据保护的几家监管机构发表了一份联合声明，要求社交媒体在这个领域提供保证。随后，欧盟竞争管理局开始调查Libra，担心“可能存在竞争障碍”。从政治角度看，美国众议院金融服务委员会要求Facebook停止Libra的开发和推出，列举了一系列最近的丑闻，并称“当前加密货币市场缺乏明确的监管框架”。此外，美国众议院金融服务委员会民主党后来致信Facebook，要求该公司停止Libra的开发，原因是隐私、国家安全、交易和货币政策的担忧。在对计划中的加密货币的最严厉攻击中，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔在2019年7月10日向国会作证时表示，美联储对Libra如何处理“洗钱、消费者保护和金融稳定”问题有“严重担忧”。可以认为，即使项目在开发过程中取得了很大进展，它仍将在成立之前和整个过程中面临相当大的反对，并且需要与国际监管保持一致。

- en: In mid-December 2018, the Venezuelan economy is estimated by the IMF to have
    exceeded 1,000,000% price inflation, otherwise identified as hyperinflation, combined
    with a premium of approximately 2,500% between its official currency, the bolivar,
    and a black-market exchange rate that has been thriving under the influence of
    those with access to the official rate at source. Throughout 2018, the Venezuelan
    government under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro have established a
    number of routes through which they could reduce the burden of economic collapse.
    Primarily, a new sovereign bolivar (bolivar soberano) was identified to replace
    the old bolivar (bolivar fuerte) at a conversion rate of 100,000:1, indicating
    that 100,000 old bolivars was the equivalent of US$1.5 cent.[²](#fn_35) Other
    countries with high levels of inflation, like Zimbabwe and Ecuador, have escaped
    by adopting the dollar, which would most likely be politically unacceptable for
    Mr Maduro’s regime. Zimbabwe pegged their economy to the US dollar when citizens
    refused to accept payments in the local currency. In Venezuela, which deprives
    people of access to dollars more effectively than did Zimbabwe (noting that the
    Zimbabwean economy underwent four rounds of redenomination and the printing of
    the $100 trillion bill before resorting to building a new currency), people could
    switch from the bolivar to the Petro.

  zh: 2018年12月中旬，国际货币基金组织（IMF）预计委内瑞拉经济已超过100万%的价格通胀，即恶性通胀，同时其官方货币玻利瓦尔（bolivar）与受那些能获取官方汇率来源影响而日益繁荣的黑市汇率之间大约有2500%的溢价。在2018年全年，在尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统领导下，委内瑞拉政府建立了一系列途径以减轻经济崩溃的负担。主要的是，一种新的主权玻利瓦尔（bolivar
    soberano）被确定以100,000:1的兑换率取代旧玻利瓦尔（bolivar fuerte），这意味着100,000旧玻利瓦尔相当于1.5美分。[²](#fn_35)
    其他像津巴布韦和厄瓜多尔这样通胀率高的国家通过采用美元摆脱了困境，这对于马杜罗先生的政权来说很可能政治上是不可接受的。津巴布韦在经济危机时将货币与美元挂钩，当时公民拒绝接受以当地货币支付。在委内瑞拉，由于比津巴布韦更有效地剥夺了人们获取美元的权利（注意到津巴布韦经济在采用新货币之前经历了四轮重新定价和100万亿美元钞票的印刷），人们可以从玻利瓦尔转向石油币。

    sovereign asset. The Petro’s pre-sale to investors began on 20 February 2018,
    where 38.4 million tokens were made available until 19 March 2018\. The Venezuelan

- en: The introduction of the Petro is quite similar to the German government’s decision
    to introduce the Rentenmark to stem the growth of hyperinflation during the 1920s.
    The Rentemark was made stable through the backing of property used for agriculture
    and business, tangible products through which the German population could hold
    as security to underpin the value of the Papiermark. This is one of the key differences
    when observing the Petro and it’s underlying fulcrum. Without explicit backing,
    this product is simply driven by unsupported market sentiment, offering little
    for a population desperate for economic stability. Although not the first Venezuelan
    cryptocurrency, products such as Bolivarcoin, Onixcoin, Rilcoin and Perlacoin
    have preceded Petro, however, each have had little purchase internationally. When
    initially announced in December 2017 by President Maduro, one major concern was
    identified in this new cryptocurrency’s ability to circumvent US sanctions that
    had been implemented on the Venezuelan economy and their ability to access international
    financing. Officials of Iran and Russia have said their governments might be interested
    in issuing cryptocurrencies. The Marshall Islands announced that it would issue
    one, called the sovereign, that it will accept as legal tender. The Marshall Islands
    is a dollarised economy; a second currency would give it at least the illusion
    of greater control over its money. Iran and Russia are subject to American sanctions.
    The one common theme throughout these envisaged planned cryptocurrencies is a
    non-standard relationship between these countries and the economy of the United
    States. The US Department of the Treasury have explicitly warned that investor’s
    partaking in the initial coin offering of Petro would be in breach of such sanctions
    that have been imposed on countries such as Venezuela.

  zh: 石油币的引入与20世纪20年代德国政府为了遏制恶性通货膨胀而引入 Rentenmark 的做法非常相似。Rentenmark 通过支持农业和商业用途的财产而保持稳定，这些有形的产品使得德国民众可以将其作为担保来支撑
    Papiermark 的价值。这是观察石油币及其基础支点时的一个关键区别。如果没有明确的支撑，这种产品仅仅是由没有支撑的市场情绪驱动，对于迫切需要经济稳定的民众来说，这提供不了多少帮助。尽管Petro不是第一个委内瑞拉加密货币，但Bolivarcoin、Onixcoin、Rilcoin和Perlacoin等产品已经先行，然而，这些产品在国际上购买力都很小。2017年12月由总统马杜罗首次宣布时，人们最主要的担忧是这种新加密货币能否绕过针对委内瑞拉经济实施的美国制裁，以及他们能否获得国际融资。伊朗和俄罗斯官员表示，他们的政府可能对发行加密货币感兴趣。马绍尔群岛宣布将发行一种名为sovereign的货币，并将其作为法定货币接受。马绍尔群岛是一个美元化经济；第二种货币至少会给他们带来更大控制货币的幻觉。伊朗和俄罗斯受到美国的制裁。这些计划中的加密货币与这些国家和美国经济之间存在非标准的联系，这是贯穿这些加密货币的一个共同主题。美国财政部明确警告，参与Petro首次币发行（ICO）的投资者将违反对委内瑞拉等国家的制裁。
- en: The ethical underpinning that supports the generation of the Petro is somewhat
    opaque. A number of rating agencies, international economists and news agencies
    have all stated that this product is nothing more than a scam and a product to
    circumvent restrictions while providing false hope to a desperate population.
    The project has been identified as missing critical information, from the description
    of the mechanism to its technology and supposed oil-backing. The underlying technology
    supporting the product has been broadly challenged and has throughout 2018 changed
    substantially from that information provided in the Petro’s original white-paper.
    The principal platform for the coin is NEM, where accounts are anonymous, but
    can disclose their identities in the description of their coins if they wish.
    The Venezuelan government issued 82.4 million tokens from an NEM account in March
    2018 described as preliminary coins. The product has continued to evolve as a
    product who’s underlying structure remains fluid, but this is not a unique selling
    point, in fact, it would raise fears that there is a strong theme of desperation
    from economic collapse at the foundations of the necessity for this outlier sovereign
    product designed specifically to ‘petrolise’ salaries and prices. The Petro has
    also continued to obtain support from a number of international exchanges. Hong
    Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest exchanges by volume, in March
    said it never intended to list the Petro due to its ‘limited utility.’ The only
    exchange that has publicly discussed plans to list the Petro is India’s Coinsecure.
    As of late 2018, the product remains un-traded. The technology behind the coin
    is said to be in development while nobody has been able to make use of the Petro
    despite claims of substantial investment at the time of the ICO. Further, a number
    of international journalist who have contacted the Venezuelan government for comment
    remain unanswered while the Superintendence’s website is unresponsive. In August
    2018, President Maduro announced that salaries, pensions and the exchange rate
    for the bolivar would be pegged to the Petro, thereby underpinning the economy
    to the simplistic assumption that one barrel of oil (priced at approximately $66
    at the time that this peg had taken place, backed with crude oil reserves located
    in a 380-square-kilometre area surrounding Atapirire[⁴](#fn_37)) is equivalent
    to one Petro. This statement and the precarious nature of this sovereign cryptocurrency
    presented a strong signal of the desperation that had now taken over, that a government
    would simply rest their economic future (although already bleak) on an exceptionally
    high-risk, high-volatility, untested, unverified and most likely illegal product.

- en: On the 9 of January 2018, camera manufacturer Kodak announced that it was entering
    the cryptocurrency market through the creation of KODAKOne, described as a revolutionary
    new image rights management and protection platform secured in the blockchain.
    Kodak announced that its development seamlessly registers, manages and monetises
    creative assets for the photographic community ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_012)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_012))). It would be used to underpin the assured
    buying and selling of rights-cleared and protected digital assets while ensuring
    transparency. The announcement had a significant sharp impact on volatility (which
    peaked at over 60% per day) with shares increasing from over $3 per share to over
    $12 in less than one week. This was associated with an increase in market sentiment
    and research using terms such as ‘Kodak’ and ‘KODAKCoin’. Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke
    said in a press statement, ‘For many in the technology industry, ‘blockchain’
    and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled
    to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys
    to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem.’ In theory, photographers will
    be able to upload their images to a platform called KodakOne, create a blockchain-based
    license for each image, and use web-crawling software to scour the Internet looking
    for copyright violations. Instead of using dollars, photographers can have clients
    pay them in KODAKCoins. However, there are many analysts and market-commentators
    alike that continue to identify Kodak’s strategy as a technique to capitalise
    on the current cryptocurrency frenzy or is it indeed a valid evolutionary characteristic
    of blockchain.

    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-007_ref_012))。它将用于支持权利清理和保护的数字资产的买卖，同时确保透明度。这一宣布对波动性产生了显著的锐化影响（每天的波动性峰值超过了60%），股价从每股超过3美元上涨到不到一周时间内超过12美元。这与市场情绪的增强以及使用“柯达”和“KODAKCoin”等术语的研究增加有关。柯达首席执行官杰夫·克拉克在一份新闻声明中说：“对于许多科技行业的的人来说，‘区块链’和‘加密货币’是热门的流行词，但对于那些长期以来一直在努力控制自己的作品及其使用方式的摄影师来说，这些流行词是解决他们感觉像是一个无解问题钥匙。”从理论上讲，摄影师将能够将他们的图片上传到一个名为KodakOne的平台，为每张图片创建一个基于区块链的许可，并使用网络爬虫软件在互联网上寻找版权侵犯行为。而不是使用美元，摄影师可以让客户用KODAKCoins支付他们。然而，许多分析师和市场评论员继续认为柯达的策略是一种利用当前加密货币狂潮的技巧，或者这确实是区块链的

    indicate a substantial and sustained increase in return volatility in the period
    after the announcement of Kodak’s intention to create a cryptocurrency. Such announcements
    can potentially take advantage of the euphoric and speculative investment motives
    that have been inflating what some consider to be a significant bubble in cryptocurrency
    markets. Announcements without strong supporting evidence can present an channel
    through which speculative contagion can flow from cryptocurrency markets to equity
    markets. The definition provided by the US Securities and Exchange Commission
    for a ‘pump-and-dump’ specifically comes to mind, that often occur on the Internet
    where it is common to see messages posted that urge readers to buy a stock quickly
    or to sell before the price goes down, or a telemarketer will call using the same
    sort of pitch. Often the promoters will claim to have ‘inside’ information about
    an impending development or to use an ‘infallible’ combination of economic and
    stock market data to pick stocks. In reality, they may be company insiders or
    paid promoters who stand to gain by selling their shares after the stock price
    is ‘pumped’ up by the buying frenzy they create. Once these fraudsters ‘dump’
    their shares and stop hyping the stock, the price typically falls, and investors
    lose their money. These ‘sudden’ cryptocurrency announcements have also attracted
    the attention of regulators. Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC), said that the agency was ‘looking closely at the disclosures
    of public companies that shift their business models to capitalise on the perceived
    promise of distributed ledger technology.’ However, Kodak then decided to delay
    the ICO of KODAKCoin in an attempt to verify accredited status of approximately
    40,000 potential investors. The SEC requires that an individual accredited investor
    has a net worth that exceeds $1 million, or an annual income of at least $200,000,
    along with other conditions. The company claims it needs ‘several weeks’ to verify
    the ‘accredited investors’ status of those who applied to invest in the ICO. Potential
    investors from outside the US would then be considered in accordance with their
    local jurisdictions. But one key point that can be taken from the case of Kodak
    is that it’s price, two months later, remained elevated by almost 100% of that
    from early January 2018\. Even without the implementation of an ICO, the announcement
    of a cryptocurrency related plan has potentially incorporated any cryptocurrency
    speculation into the share price of a publicly traded company. This is a point
    of concern for regulators and policy-makers alike.

    previous known as AgriVest Americas and Grand Paracaraima Gold respectively. In
    2017, there are twelve companies who then change their names, and eleven in 2018\.
    When comparing the companies who had partaken in crypto-exuberant company announcements,
    those who have utilised cryptocurrency and blockchain when naming are found to
    have on average higher returns, yet more volatile returns with mean returns of
    −0.0081% and a standard deviation of 5.1575%. Further, such companies exhibit
    far more substantial extreme returns (where evidence is provided of one-day price
    decreases of 52.8% and increases of 57.7% when compared to −15.9% and 16.9% in
    non-cryptocurrency companies respectively), further associated with skewness and
    kurtosis in excess of three times that of other non-cryptocurrency-based company
    names. Such a result indicates that companies that partake in the use of cryptocurrency-based
    naming practices are found to be substantially riskier shares to purchase when
    compared to other companies that have changed their corporate name for other types
    of reasons.

- en: Quite incredibly, there have also been two companies who have actually changed
    their name twice, in both cases from a non-crypto-exuberant name to a crypto-exuberant
    name and then back again. In August 2018, Focused Capital II Corp announced its
    intention on the TSX Venture Exchange to change its name to Fortress Blockchain
    Corp, clearly positioning its corporate identity to be further associated with
    the growing blockchain and cryptocurrency markets. During this transaction, the
    company issued 71.2 million common shares and signalled its intention to begin
    trading on the TSXV under the ticker ‘FORT’. In a largely unanticipated move,
    in April 2019, Fortress Blockchain then applied to the TSX Venture Exchange to
    change its name to Fortress Technologies Inc while continuing to use the same
    ticker. This situation is the only identified case within the dataset of a company
    retracting on its decision to partake in crypto-exuberant behaviour. However,
    Long Island Iced Tea Corp. remains as one of the most famous companies to employ
    a crypto-exuberant naming strategy when changing their corporate identity to Long
    Blockchain Corp in 2017\. The stock price then sharply increased almost 300% stating
    that it was ‘shifting its primary corporate focus’ from tea to distributed-ledger
    technology. In 2019, it has been announced through warrants in the United States
    that the FBI is looking for evidence of insider trading and securities fraud connected
    to Long Island Iced Tea stock, where two men related to a separate company, were
    arrested for securities fraud. There have also been broad accusations about the
    presence of a ‘pump-and-dump’ scheme, where promoters buy a cheap stock, start
    hyping it to investors with eye-catching claims, then sell their own holdings
    during the resulting mania, hopefully securing a profit before the stock comes
    crashing down. Based on a number of text messages that the FBI have since uncovered,
    they are interested in a person known as ‘Eric W’ in a series of messages, where
    the accused person owned approximately 15% of the shares in Long Island Iced Tea
    at the time that the company’s name was changed. There is further investigation

    business practices was based on the development of veterinary products patent
    and developing new ways to test for disease.

  zh: 令人惊讶的是，还有两家公司实际上已经更改了两次名称，两次都是从非加密货币的名称改为加密货币的名称，然后又改回原样。2018年8月，Focused Capital
    II Corp在TSX Venture Exchange上宣布，计划将其名称改为Fortress Blockchain Corp，明确将其企业身份与日益增长的区块链和加密货币市场联系起来。在此交易中，该公司发行了7120万股普通股，并示意其打算在TSXV上以“FORT”代码开始交易。在很大程度上出乎意料的是，2019年4月，Fortress
    Blockchain随后向TSX Venture Exchange申请将其名称更改为Fortress Technologies Inc，同时继续使用相同的代码。这种情况是数据集中唯一一个撤回其参与加密货币行为的决策的公司。然而，Long
    Island Iced Tea Corp. 在2017年将其企业身份改为Long Blockchain Corp时，仍然是采用加密货币命名策略的最著名公司之一。当时股价急剧上涨了近300%，称其正在“将主要企业重点”从茶叶转向分布式账本技术。2019年，通过美国认股权证宣布，FBI正在寻找与Long
    Island Iced Tea股票相关的内部交易和证券欺诈的证据，其中与另一家公司有关的两名男子因证券欺诈被逮捕。还有关于存在“拉高出货”计划的广泛指控，即推广者购买低价股票，开始对投资者提出吸引眼球的主张，然后在产生的狂热中出售自己的持股，希望在此之前获得利润，然后在股票暴跌之前。根据FBI此后发现的短信，他们对一系列短信中被称为“Eric
    W”的人感兴趣，当时被指控的人拥有Long Island Iced Tea大约15%的股份，在公司名称更改时。此外，还在调查投资者关系计划在那时围绕公司开发炒作的情况。Riot
    Blockchain在2018年和2019年也一直受到SEC的调查。它之前的名字是Bioptix，其之前的商业实践是基于兽医产品专利的开发和寻找新的疾病测试方法。

- en: While clearly portraying evidence of the multiple issues that the market for
    ICOs have experienced in recent times, including that of moral hazard, adverse
    selection, insider trading and market manipulation amongst others, and the very
    fact that participants have been continuously proven to have acted out outside
    existing regulatory frameworks, have caused much distrust within the broad ICO
    market. In many cases there was an absence of due diligence, standardised financial
    reporting, prospectuses containing the main risk factors of the company and its
    businesses and broad corporate governance. Instead, many fund providers to these
    projects released whitepapers with poor information, in some cases omitting the
    name of the company or its address, however, focusing on marketing techniques,
    even in some cases using celebrities in an almost tactical capacity to distract
    investors. The first responses from national regulators around the world focused
    on warnings and guidance while providing thorough investigations with reports
    and outright bans (such as that seen in China in September 2017). Most regulators
    would agree that although ICOs are currently not governed by specific regulations,
    the broad practices of many ICOs might already fall under existing legal and jurisdictional
    coverage. Recently, it has been discussed that some ICOs might actually be contained
    within the scope of regulation focused on Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), private
    placement of securities, crowdfunding or even collective investment schemes.

  zh: 虽然明确地揭示出近年来ICO市场所经历的多重问题，包括道德风险、逆向选择、内幕交易和市场操纵等，以及参与者不断被证明是在现有监管框架之外行动，这在很大程度上导致了ICO市场的广泛不信任。在许多案例中，存在尽职调查不足、标准化财务报告缺失、包含公司及其业务主要风险因素的招股说明书和广泛的公司治理空白。相反，许多这些项目的资金提供者发布的白皮书信息不准确，在某些情况下省略了公司的名称或地址，然而却专注于营销技巧，甚至在某些情况下利用名人以几乎策略性的方式分散投资者的注意力。世界各国监管机构最初的反应集中在发出警告和提供指导的同时，提供彻底的调查报告和直接的禁令（如2017年9月中国所采取的措施）。大多数监管机构会认为，尽管当前ICO不受特定法规的约束，但许多ICO的广泛做法可能已经受到现有法律和司法管辖范围的覆盖。最近，有讨论认为一些ICO实际上可能包含在针对首次公开募股（IPOs）、证券私募发行、众筹甚至集体投资计划的监管范围内。
- en: The development and growing sophistication of international regulatory scrutiny
    has somewhat alarmed cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. In the past, the rapidly expanding
    ICO landscape resembled a free for all, where the most talented and knowledgeable
    appear to have been taking funds from the most vulnerable who were seeking quick
    profit. The negative media coverage on cryptocurrency criminality has most certainly
    attracted the attention of regulatory authorities. The effect of increased scrutiny
    by authorities has been to multiply regulatory barriers for entrepreneurs aspiring
    to begin an ICO. However, this has generated some confusion. There has been considerable
    controversy over the status of utility tokens, which require fewer disclosure
    forms and checks from the SEC and which are favoured by most startups opting for
    an ICO. The SEC were seen to have adequately forewarned cryptocurrency startups
    when asserted that most ICO tokens would require greater disclosure, the first
    time that the commission had clarified its stance regarding ICOs. The increased
    level of regulation for a security token sale appears to have made ICOs costlier
    while taking more time as compared to an ICO for utility tokens, where the average
    cost is estimated to be between $1 million and $3 million for a security token
    sale. Private sales to accredited investors also shift costs of conducting a public
    ICO. Entrepreneurs have increasingly begun issuing a bonus (or discount) on their
    tokens to private investors.

  zh: 国际监管监督的发展和日益复杂化使得加密货币企业家感到某种程度的警觉。过去，迅速扩张的首次代币发行（ICO）领域就像一个自由竞争的场所，最有才华和知识的人似乎在从寻求快速利润的最脆弱的人那里筹集资金。加密货币犯罪行为的负面媒体报道无疑吸引了监管机构的注意。监管机构加强审查的效果是增加了希望开始ICO的创业者的监管障碍。然而，这也产生了一些混淆。关于实用代币的地位，已经引起了相当大的争议，这些代币需要向SEC披露的信息较少，是大多数选择ICO的初创企业的首选。当SEC表示大多数ICO代币将需要更多披露时，这似乎已充分警告了加密货币初创企业，这是委员会首次澄清其关于ICO的立场。与实用代币的ICO相比，安全代币销售的监管水平提高似乎使ICO成本更高且耗时更长，实用代币的ICO平均成本估计在100万美元至300万美元之间。向认证投资者进行的私人销售也转移了进行公开ICO的成本。企业家们越来越多地为他们向私人投资者发行的代币提供优惠（或折扣）。
- en: When the SEC released the ‘Framework for Investment Contract Analysis of Digital
    Assets’ in April 2019, many in the cryptocurrency community were unhappy with
    the broad definition which the SEC applied to securities, which left little room
    for true utility tokens. Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) have been another area
    in which regulators and cryptocurrency innovators have recently developed contrasting
    opinions. The largest concerns for the users of cryptocurrencies has been the
    security as a multitude of hacking events have generated many negative reverberations
    throughout the industry. It is against this backdrop that more regulatory oversight
    has become necessary.

    online casinos have started accepting cryptocurrency in a bid to attract younger

  zh: 5 结语
- en: In this chapter, we provide a thorough account of the key issues that have engulfed
    the ICO market in recent years, somewhat stifling the growth of illicit cryptocurrency
    auctions, but further failing to eliminate the issue completely. A central theme
    throughout these listed issues and examples surrounds substantial damage to credibility
    within the market. We have observed cases of theft at the level of the exchange,
    within the whitepapers that have been provided, through the usage of celebrities
    to support marketing tactics, through the illegal cross-jurisdictional transfer
    of funds and indeed, the most simplest form of theft, where the ICO counter-party
    quite simply disappears with the accumulated assets of investors. While cryptocurrency-enthusiasts
    continue to promote the positive attributes that support the potential growth
    of this new investment asset, the same proponents cannot ignore that this entire
    sector has been rampant with levels and styles of fraudulent behaviour that is
    quite difficult to find in other international markets of similar scale and scope.
    But there have been significant positive developments in terms of the future scope
    of international regulation and the potential to eliminate fraudulent behaviour.
    It is essential that during the continued growth of the sector for cryptocurrencies
    that regulation, including a broad international set of standards, be developed
    and maintained to grow at pace with the market for cryptocurrencies. It is essential
    that regulations must compare effectively with the sophistication of the market
    that they attempt to monitor. Until the broad gap between regulation and the capacity
    for cryptocurrency market misuse is diminished, there will continue to be substantial
    and frequent loss of investor assets through mechanisms that represent those usually
    observed in an exceptionally juvenile market.

  zh: 在本章中，我们将详细阐述近年来困扰ICO市场的关键问题，这些问题在一定程度上抑制了非法加密货币拍卖的增长，但并未完全消除这一问题。这些列举的问题和例子中的一个核心主题是市场信誉受到了巨大损害。我们观察到交易所层面的盗窃，提供的白皮书中的盗窃，利用名人支持营销策略的盗窃，非法跨国资金转移，以及最简单的盗窃形式，即ICO对手方简单地带着投资者的累积资产消失。尽管加密货币爱好者继续推广支持这一新型投资资产增长的积极属性，但这些人不能忽视整个行业充斥着各种难以在其他同等规模和范围的国际市场中找到的欺诈行为。但在国际监管的未来范围和消除欺诈行为方面已经取得了显著的积极进展。在加密货币行业的持续增长中，确保监管，包括一套广泛的国际标准，与加密货币市场的发展同步至关重要。监管必须与它们试图监督的市场
    sophistication 相匹配。除非监管与加密货币市场滥用能力的巨大差距得到缩小，否则投资者资产将通过通常在一个极其不成熟的市场上观察到的机制遭受重大和频繁的损失。
