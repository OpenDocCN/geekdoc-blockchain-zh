- en: With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, a huge amount of
    data is being generated which is characterized by all V's, (i.e., velocity, volume,
    and variety) and referred to as big data. End-users demand high security and privacy
    along with real-time response for executing of various queries on the huge volume
    of the stored data. To solve the problem of security, Blockchain (BC) technology
    emerges as a distributed data storage structure that provides transparency to
    all the users on the network. However, to reduce overall communication and computational
    cost, efficient processing along with fast validation and verification of data
    is the need of the hour. The conventional data structures result in inefficiency
    for handling big data in terms of storage and response time. Other existing query
    methods on data, such as MapReduce and SQL are not suitable for delay-sensitive
    and streaming data from IoT applications. In this context, approximation and probabilistic
    algorithms are found to be effective to reduce space and computation time complexity.
    Unlike conventional data structures, Probabilistic data structures (PDS) are based
    on hashing techniques to store data in a compact form. Less memory requirements,
    large scale data processing, real-time processing, unstructured data storage,
    reduced delay are some popular qualities for the adoption of PDS among researchers.

- en: This book will provide an in-depth theoretical and practical knowledge of PDS
    and blockchain concepts. The working of each probabilistic data structure in this
    book will be illustrated using code snippets and illustrative examples. Also,
    this a first attempt to introduce the applicability of PDS in blockchain to technology
    practitioners. Although the literature does not support much work that integrates
    PDS with blockchain but this book will provide new directions to the readers on
    the subject cited above. This book also provides references for the applications
    of PDS to blockchain. It will also have the implementation codes in Python language
    for various PDS so that the readers can gain confidence using hand-on experience.
    Simple syntax, presence of third-party module, user-friendly environment, extensive
    library support, versatility in providing data-science applications are some of
    the reasons for adopting Python as an implementation language over other existing
    languages for implementation of the concepts presented in this book.

- en: The whole book is organized in four sections with 17 chapters, each section
    preceded by an overview related to it. The first section gives a brief overview
    of IoT technology and revolution of big data because of the popularity of IoT.
    Section 2 is dedicated to the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology which
    first covers cryptographic concepts that are widely used in blockchain and also
    in PDS. Section 3 covers PDS and algorithms used to estimate membership query,
    cardinality, similarity, and frequency along with the realization of each PDS
    with Python language. Section 4 tells about the usage of PDS in blockchain based
    IoT applications for better storage and computational complexity.
