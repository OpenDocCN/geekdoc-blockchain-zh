- en: A huge number of physical objects are interconnected using enabled communication
    technologies to the Internet at an unexpected scale, referring to the concept
    of the Internet of Things (IoT). Control systems, thermostats, and HVAC (heating,
    ventilation, and air conditioning) monitoring systems that construct smart homes
    are the fundamental examples of such smart objects in IoT. IoT plays a remarkable
    role in other realms and environments such as healthcare, transportation, factory
    automation, and other emergency responses in which decision-making is difficult.
    By letting them communicate together, exchange details, and coordinate decisions,
    the IoT allows physical objects to perceive, hear, think, and accomplish tasks.
    By exploiting its primary technologies, such as ubiquitous computing, application
    and Internet protocols, sensor networks, embedded devices, and networking technologies.
    IoT transforms the physical objects from conventional to smart.

    globe, and is influencing human existence in incomprehensible ways. However, we
    are currently entering a period where numerous activities are associated with
    the web. Vermesan et al. ([2011](#CR29)) characterize IoT essentially associates
    the physical and computerized world utilizing a plenty of sensors and actuators.
    Another definition by Pena-Lopez ([2005](#CR16)) characterizes the IoT as a paradigm
    in which the computing techniques are embedded in the form of conceivable objects.
    By exploiting these techniques, the current state of the object can be identified
    and tends to be changed whenever required. In general, IoT is referred to a new
    kind of environment where all appliances and devices that we utilize are interacted
    with several varieties of sensors and actuators in order to accomplish complex
    tasks with a high level of accuracy. The data collected by the sensors has to
    be processed intelligently in order to obtain useful inferences from it. The term
    sensor is defined as the sensors such as microwave oven or mobile phone that delivers
    inputs about the internal state and the surrounding environment. An actuator is
    a device used to have an impact on environmental changes (e.g., controller in
    AC).

    edge itself. The pre-processing will occur either at proximate devices or sensor
    itself, and the processed data will be transmitted to a remote server for further
    processing. The storage capability of IoT devices is constrained due to limited
    power, energy, size, and computational capability Poongodi et al. (2020a). The
    significant research challenge is to assure obtaining correct data with a high
    level of accuracy. There is a challenge in data gathering, data handling, and
    communication as well, since the communication in the wireless network happens
    among IoT devices which are geographically dispersed. In general, the wireless
    channels are unreliable and have high distortion rates. Reliable in the sense,
    establishing communication without more occurrences of retransmission process.
    Hence, the communication technologies are considered as a significant issue while
    integrating IoT devices Poongodi et al. ([2020a](#CR18), [b](#CR19)). This chapter
    proposes a new taxonomy for IoT technologies, highlights some of the most significant,
    and describes some applications that have the potential to make a significant
    difference in human life.

    have been proposed for handling different scenarios. Initially, three-layered
    architecture was introduced, which includes perception layer, network layer, and
    application layer. The three-layered architecture describes the core idea of IoT,
    but it is not adequate to meet all the requirements. Hence, further research studies
    are focused on providing the better aspect of IoT, and the different layered architectures
    are suggested. The five-layered architecture is shown in Fig. [1.1](#Fig1), which
    includes process layer and business layer in addition (Poongodi et al., [2020a](#CR18),
    [b](#CR19)). The functionality of the perception layer and application layer is

    it is estimated that approximately 80 billion of IoT devices will be connected
    which means 1.5 million of devices in a minute. The number of IoT devices is going
    to outrange the total population in the world. Now the communication between the
    human-to-device and device-to-device communication  is getting importance nowadays.
    The success of IoT is exposed in the rapid development of technologies used in
    IoT systems. Because of the exponential growth of IoT devices, the IoT found its
    way to be applied in different applications and domains. Figure [1.2](#Fig2) shows
    the statistics on how many devices will be connected to the Internet from 2015
    to 2025 and shows that in 2025 the number of devices connected to the Internet
    will surpass the total population of the world. This shows the importance of IoT
    in the future and its impact on our lifestyle.![../images/504166_1_En_1_Chapter/504166_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_1_Chapter/504166_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png)

    or a device which has been connected with sensors and other network devices which
    in turn connect to the Internet for data communications. Examples of IoT devices
    are wireless inventory trackers, wearable health monitors, and many more. All
    the IoT devices use the feedback loops to control the entire system based on the
    real-time information. So, the IoT system is a controlled system. In a controlled
    system  , the controller will get the feedback from the sensor about the environmental
    values and compare this value with the threshold level of the system. Based on
    the comparison, it activates the corresponding actuators to do certain action.

- en: The IoT devices using sensors will monitor the environment and collect the required
    data from the environment such as rainfall detection, pressure, etc., and these
    gathered data will be forwarded to the controller. The controller in turn will
    analyze the data received from the sensor, and the decision can be made by the
    controller in fog computing. In this scenario, the sensors, actuators, and the
    controller all exist within the fog  , and it is shown in Fig. [1.3](#Fig3). This
    means that the information is not sent beyond the local network of end devices.
    All the decisions will be taken near the end devices. Example of this kind is
    the traffic signal control using the sensor, where the sensor detects the traffic
    in the surrounding environment and based on the result the traffic signals are
    controlled within the traffic signal local network.![../images/504166_1_En_1_Chapter/504166_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_1_Chapter/504166_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.png)

    through the IP network  which is depicted in Fig. [1.4](#Fig4). In this case,
    the controller should be IP enabled. Once the data arrives at the data center,
    it is processed further, and the corresponding action needs to be taken and will
    be intimated to the controller. Now after receiving the actions to be done, the
    controller will activate the actuators, and the corresponding actions will be
    performed. Further, the decisions are taken in the data center either automatically
    or by the user, and then the necessary action to be taken is passed to the controller.
    For making this to happen, the controller should be an IP-enabled device; hence
    the data can be transmitted through the Internet or through the local network.
    Gateway or router will be placed between the controller and the Internet for the
    data communication to occur. Large amount of data will be generated by the sensors,
    and only the required information is to be extracted from the data generated.
    Hence, the data center is having more powerful computing devices to process the
    data.![../images/504166_1_En_1_Chapter/504166_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_1_Chapter/504166_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.png)

    by using an analog or digital circuit. The basic classification of sensor is based
    on the parameter being sensed and sensing technology used in the sensor and also
    in the form of energy received or forwarded by the sensor. Another form of classification
    of sensor is based on the type of input signal, the application in which it is
    used, the cost of the sensor, the output signal, and the accuracy of the sensor
    output generated. When selecting the sensor, it is always important to know the
    chemical and its physical effects, and also it is noted that a sensor may use
    more than one characteristic in its implementation. During the sensor design,
    the material behavior with different physical and chemical effects must be known

    The controller receives the signal from the sensor, and it will process the data.
    Based on the output of processing, it takes a decision which is a single action
    or a series of actions which is to be performed by the actuator. The controller
    can make decisions by itself or forward the data through the Internet for processing
    by powerful systems. The most popular controller available is the Arduino and

    to establish the connectivity between the gateway and the router for the Internet
    connection within a range of 100 meters in the bandwidth of 2.4 GHz. The IEEE
    802.11n has the communication speed of 300 Mb/s. A new version of Wi-Fi named
    Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) extends the normal Wi-Fi into the bandwidth of 900 MHz
    and works with low power of connectivity among IoT devices such as sensors and
    other wearable devices. And, it is considered as the most important characteristic
    needed for IoT communication. HaLow has almost double the range of normal Wi-Fi
    and even can penetrate the walls and other obstacles in its path. HaLow can work
    with existing Wi-Fi protocols and can be applied in several IoT applications like
    smart home, healthcare, smart city, industrial markets, etc. Another version of
    Wi-Fi is 802.11af which uses the bandwidth range from 54 to 698 MHz of the unused

    and ZigBee router. The complete set acts as a device or as a coordinator or as
    a PAN coordinator. A reduced function device acts only as a device. ZigBee operates
    in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band, and the ZigBee specification

    two components, namely, tag and reader. The reader has one or more antennas which
    emit radio waves, and the tag sends the radio waves back to the reader. The tag
    uses the radio waves to communicate its identity and other additional information
    stored in it to the nearby reader. The tag can be of either passive or active
    type. Passive RFID tag doesn’t have a battery in it, and the reader will provide
    the power for the data communication, whereas active RFID tag has its own battery
    power for the data communication. The third type of tag is the battery-assisted
    passive (BAP) ID tag  ; it is a hybrid tag in which a power supply is available
    with the passive RFID tag (Landaluce et al., [2020](#CR12)). RFID tags also are
