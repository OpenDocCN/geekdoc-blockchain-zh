    thousands of miles away. That is a lot of trust between two strangers who have

    that helps elected officials and candidates interact with their voters. It does
    so by offering an online voting system where constituents vote on issues. A candidate
    for office or an elected official has a dedicated website where they can post
    information and questions and seek input from their constituents. The platform
    verifies that users are registered to vote in the appropriate election district.
    A voter can go online, sign up once, and easily express their opinion. Blockchain
    comes in to record that vote and make sure it’s immutable.

    certificate and then the system gives the education certificate a unique hash
    value. It then embeds that hash value as a QR code on that education certificate
    using a QR code reading app. All you need to do is scan the QR code of the education
    certificate with any smartphone and you can verify it right then and there. The
    app will then show you if the document you are looking at is an original or a

    user is looking at a true and correct document created by the issuer. Most documents
    are printed on plain paper to try and prevent document fraud. The most common
    practice being used is watermarks. But it’s never been easier to scan the original
    document and use photoshop to print out documents that look every bit as good
    as the original. And how can anyone tell what it is supposed to look like?

- en: There has never been more communication with more people and more readily available.
    However, at the same time, we trust each of our information less, we trust authority
    less, and we trust each other less. The beauty of blockchain lies in its replacement
    of the need for trust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain allows for preverification, which—by serving as a prevetted authority—lowers
    the barrier for trust. It’s not that blockchain makes us trust one another and
    get along, rather it eliminates the need for trust altogether. Instead of trusting
    each other, we need only trust the highly secure, decentralized technology. And
    with ever-increasing complexity in increasingly sensitive and valuable transactions,
    eliminating risk is essential.

- en: By securing our communications and interactions, blockchain replaces trust as
    a tie that binds. And when trust isn’t an obstacle, there are boundless opportunities
    for making operational improvements, such as remote management and oversight of
    your business
