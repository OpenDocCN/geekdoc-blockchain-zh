- en: A few small nations have realized that if they are going to compete in a global
    economy, they have to offer more and do it in a way that does not burden their
    citizens. In order to compete, they’ve shifted many of the traditional ideas around
    what it means to provide citizenship. In a world that is moving from hard borders
    to very porous ones, where people have the power to choose where they live and
    what country they call home, these small countries are doing well.

    offering different advantages. Countries are moving away from the passive citizenship
    model, where you’re born a citizen of a country, to one where you choose citizenship
    based on the advantages that that country offers.
  prefs: []

    Government can exist without borders or a physical location. Old models see citizenship
    as a location that can be invaded and overruled by another nation or sources within,
    such as a revolution.

    It has limited resources to meet the needs of its citizens, but through technology,
    it has been able to exceed the capabilities of many larger nations. Estonia launched
    digital ID cards for online services and was the first country to offer *e-Residency,*
    a digital identity, available to anyone in the world interested in operating a
    business online.

    It shifted completely away from traditional government to one where it utilizes
    a *single-window principle* (one point of access for citizens). The single-window
    principle enables access to all tax and customs services for citizens with a single
    secure log-in anywhere in the world. Straightforward and paper-free transactions
    are made possible through this system. Everything, except marriage and real estate
    purchases, can be done completely online. Estonian citizens can make bank transfers
    or pay tax in a few minutes.

    €125 million more in value-added tax (VAT) than the previous year due to the development

    calculator that pulls data from incorporated banking systems of citizens. It also
    made it easy to submit invoices to the system.

    citizens have been trying to use tokens as a means to launder money out of the
    country or hide profits from taxation. This has caused the Chinese government
    to tighten regulation around the use of cryptocurrencies. However, as the usefulness
    of the underlying blockchain technology has expanded beyond the movement of value,
    China has begun to embrace blockchain technology.

    fade quietly out of the public’s consciousness and just start making your online

    is ready to be disrupted. A legend in online security has taken on the challenge.
    Dr. John McAfee, the antivirus software pioneer, has created a new platform for
    email based on blockchain technology.
  prefs: []

    is a blockchain-based email. It isn’t that different from the email systems you’re
    used to. It’s easy to navigate, and some developers have built mobile apps and
    web-based apps to make the experience more convenience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SwiftMail’s blockchain confirms that your mail is genuine and that the emails
    you send were received by the intended parties, removing the need to trust a third
    party, like Yahoo!, with your data. There is also a small inherent cost to send
    an email that desensitizes spammers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a blasé attitude. John McAfee says, “If privacy doesn’t matter, would you be willing
    to give your wallet to a total stranger and let them go through it and write down
    everything they find inside? Then why on earth would we believe that if we’re
    not doing anything wrong, we shouldn’t care if someone has our information?”

    application on your computer. They are 32 random characters with no metadata to

    to thieves.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the fundamental tenets that blockchain enthusiast talks about is the
    personal responsibility of owning the data that you create and that identifies
    you uniquely. This concept might seem straightforward, but most people don’t own
    or control the data that represents their identities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the control is held by centralized databases that are vulnerable to
    hacking. These databases hold the information, and certificate authorities validate
    that the information is correct and unaltered. In the information age, your data
    is your identity. The more distributed the data is, the higher the likelihood
    that it will fall into the hands of those who want to misuse it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain-based identity places control of identity in the hands of the individuals
    or corporations that that the identity represents. Central databases and certificate
    authorities are not necessarily replaced. Data still needs a secure home, and
    it still makes sense to have third parties validate the authenticity of documents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The value in changing the order of responsibility around identity is that it
    becomes harder to steal, hold hostage, or manipulate the underlying documents
    that represent your identity. Information is shared as needed without exposing
    unnecessary information.  ## Oracle of the Blockchain'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain technology doesn’t solve for the problem that information must come
    from somewhere. It’s also important that the information can be relied on. It’s
    the human element that can’t yet be removed from the equation when you want to
    act on a contract within a blockchain system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no central authority to police or enforce honesty in a blockchain system.
    Predicting the future honesty of authors of information is impossible. The logical
    conclusion is that each transaction must cost less than the cost to rebuild reputation.
    The reputations of trusted authors are built over time, and the longer an author
    is honest and correct, the more valuable the author’s reputation becomes. This
    concept is similar to the value of a name brand.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart contracts and chain codes have created a new opportunity for knowledgeable
    individuals and corporations to monetize their information. These types of systems
    need trusted sources of information to execute against. These trusted sources
    could be rating agencies, weather outlets, or just about anything else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could also connect IoT devices to a blockchain infrastructure and have them
    create their own voices and identities on a blockchain network. They need to build
    trust over time and can still be corrupted at any given point. Past honesty doesn’t
    prevent future dishonesty or the corruption of a source of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not all smart contracts or chain codes are self-contained or execute against
    infallible sources. The more practical and applicable business use case requires
    information to be derived from sources outside the known universe of any given
    blockchain network. Several startups are attacking this problem from different
    angles.

    pioneered the idea of prediction markets. Augur is a platform that rewards users

    money by buying shares in the correct outcomes. The cost of the shares fluctuates
    based on how the community feels about the likelihood of the event acutely happening.
    Augur is similar to a betting website. Anyone can make a prediction. Anyone can
    create a prediction market for any given event. This would allow you as a business
    owner, for example, to take a poll on what people think is most likely to occur.

    rights is the music industry. Artists at the top are squeezed out economically
    by the many intermediaries that rely on their creative work. Small artists can’t
    make music a primary source of income because they only see a small fraction of
    the revenue. Mega-stars make it on the sheer volume of fans.

- en: The Internet has made it easier for artists of all sizes to share their work.
    At the same time, it has made it even harder for people to make a comfortable
    living doing what they love. The music industry food chain is a long, and each
    intermediary takes a small piece of the pie and adds to the length of time that
    it takes for funds to finally reach the artist. Often, the artist will wait up
    to 18 months or more to see any money and may only get $0.000035 per instance
    of her music being streamed. This situation is a best-case scenario in our current
    market, with no one defrauding the artist.
