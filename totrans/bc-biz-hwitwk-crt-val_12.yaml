    keywords that is in trend which everyone tries to know something about. Its cornerstone
    is the DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) [1] which uses a decentralized public
    Ledger that is used while interacting in a strictly peer-to-peer network adhering
    to a protocol and protected by cryptography. Due to the nature of decentralization,
    that is the absence on a central governing body and transactions and data that
    are not verified and owned by one single entity as they are in typical systems
    but rather, the validity of transactions are confirmed by any node or computer
    that has access to the network. This transparency of the ledger is one of the
    reasons blockchains rise to fame as it is theoretically impervious to tampering.
    However, this technology also has its fair share of privacy issue, from its fundamental
    functioning to external agents such as DDoS attacks and security breach of the
    independent nodes. The shared ledger also means any malicious change or modification
    will become permanent and immutable. We discuss some of the common issues faced
    in the real world with regards to the use of blockchain networks.

    able to perform transactions without leaking identification information. At the
    same time, privacy allows a user to remain compliant by discerningly divulging
    themselves without showcasing their activity to the entire network. In practicality
    the blockchain network is highly vulnerable to privacy leaks [4] due to the visibility
    of the discrete user’s public key and IP trace.

    Making multiple transactions from the same address increases the likelihood of

    X makes a transaction with person Z through person Y, then Y takes in input from
    multiple inputs m1, m2, m3 and has multiple outputs o1, o2, o3, etc. This makes
    it harder to track the transaction between person X and person Z. However, this
    requires us to trust the intermediate to not sell our information or outright
    steal it. There are solutions to it, for example Coinjoin [10] employs a central

    It typically requires the network operator to be compromised first leading to
    the hackers controlling the operator. Thereafter both network and node attacks
    can be performed. The attacker can effectively divide the blockchain network and
    slow its message propagation speed. By redirecting miners to the attacker’s own
    pool, he can steal the victim’s cryptocurrency. It was estimated that $82,000
    was stolen for unsuspecting victims over a period of two months using this exploit.
    The network administrators do not have a reliable way to track down such attacks

    BGP-Mon. The recovery is manual and requires a lot of manual reconfiguration to

    miner has three possible actions: (1) to extend the main chain, ignoring the header,
    (2) To extend the block header (SPV mine), or (3) To stop mining, neither expending
    power nor winning rewards. If the miner follows option 1 and extends the main
    chain, finding and broadcasting a new block, the attacking miner uses his relatively
    high connectivity (as in selfish mining) and propagates the full block corresponding
    to the header BA. This causes a race between two groups of miners, those that
    hear of the attacker’s block data first and those that hear of the rational miner’s
    block first. Therefore, if original profitability in the “no attack” setting isn’t
    too high, in both cases, the attacker can ensure that the honest miner ends up
    losing money. So, the BDoS attacker’s threat means that the honest miner is better
    off giving up and just not mining, i.e., going with option 3\. First, the attack
    will succeed if the hash rate of the attacker is suﬃciently large. Second, it
    will succeed if the hash rate of miner is small enough. Finally, it will succeed
    if miner i wasn’t making much profit in the first place.'

    In general terms, we recognize that a network is decentralized when the control
    of the network is shared among a subset of the network’s nodes. The node is a

    methods at the same time giving legal clarity to the participants. The technology
    mainly benefits the innovators but the benefits are not only limited there. The
    regulators themselves might reap huge benefits in the future from the implications
    of this technology. A number of approaches are described to enforce regulations
    without disrupting the growth. They can for example rely on small scale projects
    and run blockchain. The problems that are discovered would help in gaining insight
    into the potentials aspects we need to keep in mind while dealing with the technology.
    A further option is the use of the 28th regime used in context of the EU. A 28th
    regime is an optional legal framework that does not replace the current existing
    framework, but rather works with it as additional laws should they be needed for
    enforcement. The private firms would get the choice of relying on either framework
    for their businesses and the legal system would not need to go through a major
    up haul. This would be easier in the EU where one can facilitate transactions
    across borders without any change to the existing legal system. An extra benefit

    of the technology itself. Like the internet, cloud storage, personal computers,
    etc., any disruptive technology is not inherently bad. It occupies a morally and
    legally neutral gray area. The outcome depends on the end user using this to pursue
    their own agenda. People have been known to use it to set up shady website that
    offers illegal services and also to pay off other criminals with untraceable cryptocurrency.
    These activities are already illegal and laws exist to deal with such infringements
    and punish the offender accordingly. We can easily modify these laws to suit the
    needs of regulating crime using blockchain and its products. FinTech is a brilliant
    example of a positive use of this technology [34] and companies such as BitPesa
    [35] have made a difference by improving the lives of other people. We tend to
    generalize and classify these as good or bad, but in real world nothing is necessarily
    black or white, it is what we make of it. There is no way to stop the expansion
    of a blockchain except to enforce control at the protocol level or to shut down
    the internet itself. Regulatory authorities should refrain from doing such actions

    providing an alternative approach of finding potential loopholes in the existing

    economy”. It went as far as to collect 150 million in funding to build a finical
    institution resembling modern democracy. However due to human error the hackers
    transferred a third of its funds in their accounts. These funds could not be transferred
    back due to the immutable nature and the highly quinquennial decision of a hard

    hype around it and making everyone rush to get into it. A recent survey found
    blockchain to be the most overrated word in the 2018\. It is little surprising
    considering many companies tested blockchain with very little to show for it.

    blockchains and how governments won’t be able to regulate it. The second group
    consists of individuals who believe that this technology is another gimmick that
    will fade and fade into oblivion. They put is as a local hype like the Google
    glasses which will ultimately fail due to lack of public support. Bill Barhydt
    the CEO of Abra, believes that blockchain will not amount to anything in the near
    future. Some have pointed out that despite bold claims and over $130 billion in
    crowd funding nothing tangible was seen till 2018 and the adoptions after that
    have merely added blockchain to solve problems they themselves created.

    We place our trust in the bank to deduce the amount from our account and add it
    to the respective account of the recipient. Using blockchain technology we eliminate
    the third party and employ the nodes to verify by a process known as mining. Wikipedia
    defines mining as ’the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin’s public
    ledger of past transactions‘. Each block also needs to send proof of work which
    is to attach the history of past messages and spend some time trying to find the
    hash (fixed for the network).If one miner were to change a block, he would have
    to change all blocks that come before it or be removed due to inconsistency. This
    costs computational power which is not possible in the fixed time frame it is
    given for the work. Thus, the traditional methods of tampering with information
    are not possible in blockchain. Blockchain minimises trust and distributes it
    evenly among all nodes in the network [61].

    person does not have a lot of power in a democracy. For example, if one purchased
    a product from an e-retailer they place their trust in a lot of people they do
    not know. They trust the website, the e-retail business itself, the software,
    the database to store the order correctly, even the delivery guy who can misplace
    the package but report that it was delivered. When using blockchain these problems
    are circumvented because the database, the order information, the order status

    Kiviat makes the bold assertion that “trustless means that—for the first time
    in history—exchanges for value over a computer network can be verified, monitored,
    and enforced without the presence of a trusted third party or central institution,”
    [63]. Madisetti explain that “peers do not need a trusted intermediary for interacting
    with each other,” since a “blockchain network is not controlled by a central authority

    by brute force methods which involve a lot of trial and errors which makes. The

    via special tokens. We even see the rise of databases being provided as a cloud
    service for corporate use. But the problems that plagued them from the early days
    of its life still remain. The databases is vulnerable to physical calamities and
    damages that could not have been prevented. A survey also found that around 40
    to 55% to attacks on databases occur from within and by employees with admin access
    and privileges [70]. A paper published in 2019 demonstrated how we can create
    a decentralized database that supports both sql and non-sql based commands. Users
    are identified by unique public keys and their transactions are signed by this
    public key. A master table stores the index of the recent transactions and the
    associated data store entries. This enables a fast synchronisation and validation.
    The unsynchronized parts are quickly synchronized by the other members. The users
    can choose to be a node only concerned with its own transactions or provide resources
    for computing other transactions. The integrity of data is checked by a consensus
    mechanism and the operation is rolled back if consensus is not reached. This process
    can be completed in a few seconds and the user promptly updated about the status
    of his transaction. The consensus mechanism is based upon correctness, convergence
    and agreement [71]. The main aim of the consensus is to reach an agreed data store
    state in as little time as possible. This is done keeping a threshold for byzantine
    consensus errors.

    enterprise application. All the data defined and the user operations are defined
    in an immutable log that uses blockchain technology. User applications would be
    able to send and receive data to and from the network nodes. The user query would
    be stored in a local database in a node close to the user and when consensus is
    reached, the transaction would be updated to the main database. In case a node
    fails the user could be seamlessly transferred to another node making it a zero-time
    recovery system. The faulty node can be repaired and put back in the pool.

    recovery nodes which are special nodes at remote locations which hold a copy of
    the database. In case of a disaster, the main database can be restored to the
    state of these recovery nodes without permanent loss of data. This would also
    be economically more feasible than maintaining an offshore backup in the form
    of a data center. The immutability brings the inherent feature of auditability
    to the system. In case of a traditional database, user A performs a CRUD operation
    for users B and C on table E. With the addition of the blockchain layer the operation
    is recorded as a blockchain transaction and the transaction with the corresponding
    access is signed and sent to concerned peers. Once the consensus is reached the
    network finalizes and included it in the data store. If User C requests a select
    query on table T and sends it to node N, it identifies the user from the signature
    of the query. If the user C has permission to perform the operation, the node
    executed the query and returns the result to user C. Using these approaches, we
    get a little more latency but it provides a better security and also protection
    from insider attacks.

    of Zooko’s Triangle theory we see that this approach will have all the three properties.
    The current DNS is controlled exclusively by the system administrator and they

    the enhancements of DNSSEC, the traditional DNS has vulnerabilities in its protocol
    that make it vulnerable to DoS and DDoS attacks. In the newer approach the domain
    is stored locally on all the nodes. This eliminates the need of the server to
    deal with the protocols for encoding and decoding the DNS address. All the lookups
    are performed locally and the DDoS attacks cannot impact the performance. This
    technique also makes the data of the protocol immutable thereby reducing the damage
    a server or protocol attack can do. Additionally, it offers greater security to

    its presence known in most households. This has been in many forms from smart
    speakers, Smart TVs, automatic doorbells, Smart security sensors and many more
    that share a vast amount of sensitive data amongst each other to achieve home
    automation. The list is endless and with the big tech companies making investments
    it will only grow and reach an estimated $20 million in the next decade. Many
    of these devices are lightweight with low power overhead [74]. So, they make an
    appealing target for various cyber-attacks. These devices do not have the energy
    overhead to implement computationally and energy intensive encryption protocols.
    Moreover, most of the widely used security system is highly centralized and hence
    not suited for a distributed system like IoT. If any device such as a smart door
    lock were to get hacked, the hacker would then get access to all the connected
    devices including our phones via the layers of the IoT. Most of the non-security
    devices in home automation like Alexa-enabled coffee makers do not have proper
    security and provide a lucrative opportunity for hackers to use it as an entry
    point into the home network. While applying blockchain there are two major ways
    for implementing it to secure the entire ecosystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is by using a local private blockchain connected to a smart miner
    in the home of each user. The blockchain headers would enforce policies that would
    define the access to the information. Each transaction would be stored in a block
    and the blocks would have additional parameters to uniquely identify the type
    of transaction along with the devices involved. The miner authorizes, authenticates,
    and audits transactions. In addition, the miner is involved in generating genesis
    transactions, changing the transactions structure, distributing and updating keys
    and cluster management. The miner collects all transactions into a block and appends
    the full block to the Blockchain. Additional capacity is managed in the form of
    local storage connected to the miner. The smart devices can communicate directly
    with each other or with devices on other networks. The miner would use the policies
    as a guideline to generate a shared key that the user can use to access and control
    the devices in his home. The devices would be able to send messages among themselves
    as long as the key is valid. When the key is no longer required the miner can
    simply send a control message to all the devices revoking their access. The devices
    can request a new key from the miner which decides if it should be granted by
    rules set by the user. It also maintains a log of all the devices that requested
    for the shard key and the list of transactions that took place which immutable
    and safe from tampering [75, 76].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second method is to store the access control in a distributed blockchain
    and implement smart contract between the nodes. In this method we do not use the
    IoT devices as part of the blockchain and instead use a management hub that makes
    the request on behalf of the IoT devices. Entities called ‘managers’ interact
    with the smart contract to define the access control policies of the devices and
    individual users. The IoT devices are registered under the managers and a device
    can come under multiple managers. Especial node called the agent used to deploy
    the smart contract which becomes the owner during the lifecycle of the access
    control. Management hub which are high-performance devices would be connected
    between the node and the Iota device acting as a mediator. This could use both
    a private or public blockchain to validate the transactions. The rest of the structure
    is similar to the standard IoT ecosystem. Both these approaches make the system
    resilient to DoS attacks while not compromising on performance. They also provide
    general security, maintain permanent logs and remove the problem of a single point
    of failure.

    integrated into the mainframe of the city namely the physical, application, database
    and service layers. In such cases the main security comes from pseudo anonymization,
    so that the identity of the producer or consumer can only be revealed by the joint
    treatment of data without precluding that merging data from multiple sources leads
    to identification. Personal data would no longer be identifiable without the use
    of additional attributes [78]. This approach splits the data into chunks and distributes
    it among several IoT devices. Thus, only the owner can rebuild the data. If a
    service requests access the owner can choose to share the public key via a pre-defined

    for a long time. There have been multiple attempts but none have been able to
    provide a long-term secure solution to this problem. The main weakness of all
    which makes security diﬃcult is the DNS which is a partially centralized system
    mapping system names (IP) to domains. At the moment blockchain is the only technology
    that offers a solution to this problem [81] which is why big companies like Sound
    Cloud, Facebook, and Twitter are looking into ways to implement blockchain into
    their security network. By making the entire server decentralized, the network
    request is sent to one of the millions of nodes present all over the world. If
    a hacker tries to overload, he server by flooding it with requests, the network
    would simply send the extra requests to other nodes. In this architecture a single
    node will never get overwhelmed and the network will always have additional nodes
    to deal with excessive traﬃc. An additional benefit is that a simple program can
    be used for maintenance of the nodes; this would reduce manpower costs and be
    much simpler than redirecting traﬃc and taking a server oﬄine for maintenance
    [82].

    to know about the DDoS attack in the IoT network. In IoT, a hacker can hack multiple
    devices and inject them with malicious codes indoctrinating them into the botnet
    to act as a node the sends request during the DDoS attack. In the paper (DDoS
    Botnet Prevention using Blockchain in Software Defined Internet of Things) the
    author proposed a security system involving three modules: SecPoliMod (SecurityPolicy
    Module), ConMod (controller) and LogMod (Log Module) to prevent the IoT device
    from becoming a part of the botnet [82]. These modules work together at different
    internet layers to block suspicious traﬃc and use special “colored coins” to ultimately
    prevent innocent IoT devices from becoming a soldier in the DDoS attack.'

- en: Content Delivery Network is a network of multiple systems containing the same
    set of data to increase delivery speed, provide higher bandwidth and reduce dependency.
    Currently the BitTorrent protocol is implemented in certain circles to provide
    similar service. However even with the hash verification, BitTorrent protocol
    surfers from the Byzantine Consensus problem where the systems on the CDN could
    have different data values due to uncontrollable factors or network errors. Also,
    it is possible to fake a hash and send incorrect pieces to corrupt data to cause
    data corruption. This system also provides primitive security against IP tracing
    and hacking. We have an opportunity to improve this system by implementing blockchain
    into it [83]. The immutable nature would prevent anyone from sending corrupt data
    packets and the transactions can be logged to validate transfer of data. As the
    system is already set up the implementation would be relatively easy while benefiting
    from the increased bandwidth of the network. We can improve security and provide
    a more streamlined service to the average user without him bothering about the
    minute intricacies. This new system could also help wash off the stigma of piracy
    associated with torrenting applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Authentication is the act of determining the legitimacy of a user’s identity
    mainly to give him access or service. Authentication also validates this identity
    generally by the use of digital certificates or matching passwords. Two factor
    authentications use a combination of a password and a second unique identification
    method which must be present in conjugation to be considered valid. Two phase
    authentications using one-time password (OTP) has been implemented in India for
    a long time. We are seeing other countries starting to implement similar technique
    to provide better protection against cybercrimes. Generally, in 2 factor authentication
    a onetime password is generated after the user has entered their password and
    requested for a service. This password generally consisting of 6 digits is sent
    to the user’s registered mobile number via SMS. However, attackers have found
    ways to bypass this system and gain access to the users account without their
    permission. A framework based on blockchain could be used to add better security
    and make the authentication process more secure. A study by Jesudoss and Subramaniam
    concluded there were 11 possible ways an attacker could get the password [84].
    Other independent studies have shown that the authentication model of Dropbox,
    Twitter can be compromised by exploiting certain vulnerabilities. On the other
    hand, the attacker can simply intercept the OTP or capture the session cookies
    to regenerate the OTP. In the event that the user loses their phone, the attacker
    can convince the carrier that they are the original owner and get access to all
    calls and SMS received on the phone. This is a fatal weakness and many services
    now request the users to use alternative form of authentication to bypass this
    problem.

- en: There are some approaches that have been implemented by researchers with limited
    success. One approach is to use a pseudo random function to generate the OTP [85]
    and send it to the user in the form of a smart contract. The root value is used
    to generate multiple values which is finally used for authentication. While this
    makes it impossible to tamper with the OTP, a MITM attack can still get access
    to the OTP. The second approach is making the user a member and uses a membership
    function to generate the OTP. This is similar to the previous approach in the
    way that third party attack cannot be performed. However, this method also sends
    the OTP as plain text making it vulnerable to interception and phishing attacks.
    The last approach makes the user a wallet node in the blockchain. The web application
    asks the user to send a contract to the Ethereum blockchain and waits for a set
    period of time. Ethereum checks the integrity of the user’s transaction with the
    web application an validates it. In case of a valid request the Ethereum 2FA contracts
    generates the OTP [86] and encrypts it with the user’s public key before sending
    it to him. Ethereum also computes the hash value of the OTP and conveys it to
    the website. The user decrypts and computes the hash from the OTP he receives
    and sends it to the web application. If both the hashes are found to be equal
    then the service is granted to the user. By using the public key to encrypt the
    OTP we make it impossible for any attacker to use it. Even when the attacker gets
    the encrypted OTP, it would be impossible for them to decrypt the values by brute
    force before the request time out closes the transaction.
