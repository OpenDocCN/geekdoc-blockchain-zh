    by eliminating the chances of fraudulent behavior. This can range from online
    voting and accessing government systems to as simple as logging into websites.

    systems and the challenges associated with their usage. Next is the information
    about decentralized identifiers which set up the base for discussion around blockchain-based
    identification mechanisms and the kind of data security these systems are capable
    of providing—hence giving us the added advantage over stopping potential fraudulent
    behavior. With a global pandemic underway, it has become all the more important
    to explore more systems to verify identities— especially with the supposedly reducing
    role of contact in verification.

- en: Identity management has become one of the critical necessities in the present
    world. An effective identity management system is the one that provides access
    to data only for authorized and authenticated personnel. The greater the eﬃciency
    of the system, the better will be security. The demand for such a robust but easy-to-use
    identity management scheme is growing day-by-day owing to the increase in the
    number of cyberattacks. One of the recent developments in this arena is to make
    use of blockchain technology to deal with personal identification and legality.
    The prime reason behind the choice is the foolproof nature associated with the
    blockchain systems.

    management systems. First, we will review a few of the existing identity management
    protocols and try to figure out their challenges. Next, we will see how the blockchain-enabled
    systems provide potential solutions to these loopholes. Further, we will dive
    a little more into the topic and understand its prime concepts like Digital Identity
    Relationships, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), the process of authorization,
    know-hows of revocation, and others. Lastly, we covnclude by presenting a few
    points to ponder over and with a table summarizing the important differences between
    traditional and blockchain-based identity solutions.

    them after verifying the background of the personnel thoroughly. The percentage
    of trust and the validity of the issued certificate are bound with the confidence
    level associated with the issuing department. The only way to get authenticated
    would be to produce the original copies of the certificates when demanded. The
    process of verification usually demands an in-person visit and is time-consuming.
    Furthermore, paper-based identity certificates are highly vulnerable to undesired
    activities like theft, loss, duplication, and scam. In these cases, the person
    will not be able to recover them easily and would fail to establish his identity.
    This will lead to undesirable repercussions like denial of essential services,
    the inability to obtain government grants, and failure to remain accountable ([Figure
    7.1](#figure1)).

- en: The growing use of online platforms has resulted in another popular means to
    establish one’s identity. This is known as digital identity and is a result of
    actions like registering on a website, commenting on a social network, searching
    for an item, or online shopping. Each such action, performed on the world-wide-web,
    results in a digital footprint that can be used to verify a person’s identity.
    Such a process considerably speeds up the process of authentication and most often
    eliminates the need for personal presence. However, currently, there is no dedicated,
    reliable system to accomplish this. Most of the time, the information submitted
    to a particular website remains confined within it, making it usually non-usable
    on other platforms.

    website he uses. This repetitive task is time-taking and trivial in nature. One
    more issue with the existing systems is their centralized nature. That is, the
    majority of the prevalent systems store the user data on a centralized server.
    Once the data gets stock-piled, none can control it; leave alone the user, not
    even the database owner can know where it is stored and who all has accessed it.
    This puts user privacy at its greatest stake as his data can be accessed by any
    third party at any point of time without leaving even a single scar. Furthermore,
    it is well known that the centralized servers are vulnerable to issues like single-point
    failure and hacking [1], the number of which is increasing at an alarming rate
    during recent times.

    management systems are weak and obsolete. There exist quite a lot of loopholes
    that need to be patched-up to increase their eﬃciency to the desired level. The
    truth associated with the statement is upheld, especially when it comes to factors
    like portability, time spent on verification, and, most importantly, privacy.
    This indicates that there is a critical need to develop a robust system wherein
    the user can store and manage his identity information securely while having complete
    control over its flow. That is, in such a system, an individual should have complete
    control over his data and must be able to decide on factors like ‘what,’ ‘how
    much,’ ‘with whom’ and ‘when’ while dealing with its sharing.

    central database increases the risk of being hacked. This directly implies that
    there is a need to decentralize the process by increasing the number of nodes.
    A potential solution to this would be to store the data at one’s personal device,
    say, mobile phone. Result? There will be as many data-laden nodes as the number
    of phones—greatly distributed network ([Figure 7.2](#figure2))! Undoubtedly, this
    creates a robust barrier for acts like data breaches. The associated idea of handling
    and controlling the identity by one’s self is known as Self-Sovereign Identity
    (SSID) management [2] and is based on blockchain technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The starting point for SSID would be to generate a decentralized identity (DID)
    by signing up on a self-sovereign identity data platform [3]. This would generate
    a set of user-specific private and public keys. Public keys are the ones that
    will be rotated on the chain for maintenance reasons while the private keys play
    the magic of securing the data. The only feasible way to access the stored information
    would be to use the private keys ([Figure 7.3](#figure3)), known only to the user.
    It’s a ‘no-key, no-data’ kind of arrangement where the DIDs act as an incorruptible
    digital watermark defining a person’s identity [4]. There is no way to access
    or corrupt the information except for the use of private keys.

    a set of credentials to that particular person. These documents will bear the
    cryptographic signature of the issuing authority as proof of attestation. Once
    handed over, these credentials will then fall under the possession of the applicant.

    a personal digital wallet obtained from DID issuing platforms [6]. This data will
    not be available at any other database, unlike in the case of traditional systems.
    Besides, as previously explained, this data will be completely under the control
    of the owner and cannot be accessed by any other agency without his permission.
    So, when a third party wishes to verify the identity of the owner, it will have
    to request him to provide access to his credentials stored on the blockchain.
    The owner can then decide whether to share his key with the verifier or to discard
    the request. Moreover, he need not share his full information. Instead, he can
    share only the essential bits of data while preserving other sensitive material.

    in the chain is only the references and attestations supplied by the issuers.
    This is very contradictory to the existing systems that store the exact data of
    the personnel over their databases. For instance, in case of a passport, the data
    that goes on the blockchain would be just its formal description and the cryptographic
    signature of the passport issuing agency, and not the actual passport information
    like full name, passport number, etc. As a result, the third-party verifier supplied
    with the owner’s private key would be able to view only attestation information
    but not the exact passport details.

    management system. Primely, because, in the latter systems, if any information
    is hidden from the verifier, then the owner will be declared as unauthenticated.
    However, as stated, in blockchain-enabled systems, the scenario is very different
    as the verifier does not decide on the authorization by validating the actual
    information of the owner. Instead, he will make a conclusion based on the credibility
    factor of the issuer. Concerning the passport example quoted, this means the third
    party (verifier) will declare the owner’s authenticity by considering the trustworthiness
    of the passport granting agency.

    Blockchain systems deployed by paying attention to these factors are likely to
    transform the way we view an ‘identity’. Mainly because, then, we will have a

    one’s personal data.

- en: At present, around 1.1 billion people are estimated to be living without an
    ID [12] ^(([Figure 7.10](#figure10)). The reason may be attributed to their inaccessibility
    to identity-issuing agencies, mere negligence towards possessing one, deteriorated
    economic condition, lower educational background, lack of information, or geographic
    isolation. Whatsoever the reason might be, the result would be the inability to
    gain access to the benefits offered while being deprived of essential facilities.
    Blockchain management systems may hopefully solve this issue as most of this population
    is already using devices like mobile phones, which can be used to establish their
    digital identity. This would, in turn, lead to a substantial rise in the economic
    sector.)

- en: Blockchain-enabled systems are bringing into reality the actual thought with
    which the internet emerged, peer-to-peer communication. Internet providers envisaged
    the internet as a platform that would facilitate data sharing on a one-to-one
    basis. However, as time passed, third parties, say the service providers, took
    over the control of data transferring between the users. As a result, the basic
    principle of peer-to-peer communication seemed to vanish into eternity. Nevertheless,
    with the emergence of blockchain, the principle is promisingly seen to revive
    [13]. The prime reason is, blockchain identity management systems do not demand
    the presence of a third party. The user will be the sole responsible person for
    his data and can share it with only the party whom he wants to.

- en: In blockchain identity management systems, the verifier authenticates the user
    credentials by relying on the attestation provided by the issuer. On verification,
    the new verifier also attests his cryptographic signature to the document provided.
    Next, when some other third-party desires for checking the user’s credentials,
    it takes the decision based on the previous testimonies. The chain continues,
    and the number of cryptographic signatures verifying the credentials keeps on
    increasing. However, in case, if one of these verifying parties lose their trust,
    then the authenticity of the entire chain may become questionable, posing a potential
    threat to the authenticity of the owner’s credentials. A summation of the benefits
    that SSID can provide in our everyday use cases has been shown in [Figure 7.11](#figure11).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Encroachment of blockchain technology into identity management systems is expected
    to revolutionize the concept of identity handling. These systems operate on more
    agile algorithms and are more sophisticated when compared to currently deploy
    operating mechanisms. Such systems would operate on the basic concept of decentralization,
    leading to increased privacy and decreased possibility of data breaching—Bl—blockchain
    entity systems hand-over the responsibility of maintaining one’s identity to himself.
    User, being the supreme authority can, then have complete control over his data
    and can decide sovereignly about all the factors related to its sharing. All blockchain-enabled
    systems operate on zero-knowledge, wherein a verifier validates a person’s credentials
    by relying on the reputation of the attestor rather than the actual data itself.
  prefs: []

- en: Blockchain identity systems offer many potential benefits by patching-up the
    loopholes of similar systems that exist today. Increased data privacy, minimized
    time of verification, reducing the number of fraudulent activities, providing
    better user control, elimination of central authority and dismissal of the need
    for multiple signing and verification processes are just a few to mention. Speaking
    macroscopically, blockchain-enabled systems facilitate peer-to-peer communication
    resulting in data portability, data monetization, and economic growth. Owing to
    these factors, blockchain identity management systems are much likely to replace
    the existing traditional systems in trustworthy mode. Nevertheless, to reap all
    these benefits, it is essential to deploy the blockchain systems at a large scale
    while consistently keeping-an-eye over their behavior.
