    money Bitcoin [[1](#CR1)]. The centre feature of a blockchain is decentralization.
    This implies it does not store any of its databases in a pivotal area. Rather,
    the data is replicated and distributed over a system of members. At whatever point
    any block is added to the blockchain, each computer on the system refreshes its
    blockchain to mirror the change. This distributed engineering guarantees a robust
    and secure procedure on the blockchain with the upsides of alter obstruction and
    no single-point weaknesses. Specifically, blockchain can be available for everybody
    and is not constrained by any system element. This is enabled by an instrument
    called accord, which is a set of rules to guarantee the understanding between
    all members on the position of the blockchain top. The overall idea on how blockchain
    works is shown in Fig. [1.1](#Fig1). Blockchain, a circulated record innovation
    empowers clients to connect and execute (store and recover information) with guaranteed
    information legitimacy, changelessness and non-disavowal. The appropriated idea
    of blockchain permits the mechanical elements and different 5G/IoT gadgets to
    trade information, to and from their friends, removing the necessity for concentrated
    operation.![../images/501059_1_En_1_Chapter/501059_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_1_Chapter/501059_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png)

    a blockchain is alluded to as the beginning block, which does not contain any
    exchange. Each block from that point contains various approved exchanges and is
    cryptographically connected with past blocks. When all is said and done, blockchains
    can be named either an open (permission-less) or a private (permissioned) blockchain
    [[2](#CR2)]. An open blockchain is available for everybody and anybody can join
    and cause exchanges but only some can decide the agreement procedure. The most
    popular open blockchain applications are used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Private
    blockchains have an access control system overseen by a focal element. A member

    when blockchain is thought of, the information protection is not inbuilt because
    the exchanges are affixed to the record openly upon confirmation. Security conservation
    is a critical challenge with broadly utilized encryption strategies. In any case,
    the lightweight cryptographic components produced for the asset-limited computational

    the weight on contemporary-day medical services structures will also increase.
    5G-empowered IoT contemplated a capacity choice to lighten the burden at the medical
    services devices [[42](#CR42)]. One of the appropriate responses is remote wellness
    monitoring, which incorporates the utilization of IoT sensor contraptions to a
    degree and examines numerous wellness boundaries of a customer remotely. For instance,
    Baker et al. [[43](#CR43)] perceived an IoT-based medical care device for remote
    monitoring of the wellness of significantly ill patients. Electronic wellness
    records (EHR) is the combined virtual model of patients’ wellness realities, while
    non-public wellness record (PHR) is related to the virtual report of a character
    understanding. EHR permits consistent, continuous sharing of logical and cure
    accounts of patients to ensure a legitimate logical work force [[44](#CR44)].
    It handles non-public realities and oversees fundamental issues, including confirmation,
    privacy, responsibility and realities sharing. It empowers logical partners, including
    public wellness specialists, analysts and clinical specialists, to participate
    within the blockchain network as “miners” to offer sure motivating forces. Saravanan
    et al. [[45](#CR45)] proposed a medical services worldview named Secured Mobile
    Enabled Assisting Device (SMEAD) to monitor diabetes. It is an offer up-to-surrender
    blockchain-based medical care contraption, which continuously monitors diabetic
    patients. In addition, it changed into fundamentally based at the guarantee that
    wearable devices have been presently not, at this point, suitable for crisis conditions

    of wellbeing, comfort and extravagance to the proprietors, by letting them adjust
    the settings in accordance with their decisions with the assistance of a smart
    phone program. Through the IoT, smart home devices organize with one another to
    robotize home functions in accordance with the clients’ inclinations. The literature
    mentions a few designs for energy efficient green smart houses. A notable framework
    of a smart home incorporates the ensuing assets: network availability (for the
    most part Wi-Fi), IoT-empowered sensor devices, and cell programming for remote
    access. Some basic contributions outfitted through smart houses comprise smart
    lighting, smart entryway lock, smart indoor regulator, video reconnaissance and
    smart stopping [[47](#CR47)]. To offer reasonable quality for the people living
    inside the home, the particular contributions should continually change depending
    on the desired outcome. A smart entryway lock device is a basic part of any smart
    home. Its main objective is to prevent any unapproved guests from entering the
    house. The data about the populace is kept in an important worker, which allows
    white-listed individuals to gain admission to the house. Nonetheless, the realities
    managed through such a device can be projected through an undesired individual
    who endeavours to avoid the lock contraption to attempt to gain unapproved admission
    to the device. To adapt to this issue, Han et al. [[48](#CR48)] proposed a blockchain-based
    smart entryway lock device, which bears the cost of security capacities such as
    verification, realities integrity and non-renouncement. They utilized fixed Passive
    Infrared (PIR) sensors, ultrasonic sensors and a development sensor to find indoor/outside
    gatecrashers. The blockchain network blocks keep the information about exchanges
    which contain open/lock order. The changeless idea of the blockchain network makes
    it impractical for any interloper to gain unapproved admission to the contraption
    and make any adjustment to effectively finished exchanges. Notwithstanding, the
    inactivity of IoT contraptions (sensors) can presumably be an obstacle to find
    such an interruption. This issue may be addressed by utilizing 5G Wi-Fi innovation,
    which manages the cost of discernibly low inactivity, fast interruption recognition
    and block mining of the exchanges in the blockchain. Dorri et al. [[49](#CR49)]
    proposed a blockchain-based smart home model, which incorporates three transparency

    4.0\. It plans to join the ability of different innovative areas, for example,
    IoT, blockchain and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) [[56](#CR56)]. In Industry 4.0,
    IoT is relied upon to offer promising ground-breaking answers for existing mechanical
    frameworks. Therefore, it is being viewed as a key empowering agent for the up
    and coming age of cutting-edge modern mechanization [[57](#CR57)]. Because of
    the profoundly serious market, organizations plan to pick up business points of
    interest at any expense. This powers business processes management (BPM) frameworks
    in Industry 4.0 to digitize and mechanize business procedures to build their benefits.
    In any case, by adding independent specialists to these business forms, the exchange
    expenses and dangers related to them also increase. A potential answer for handling
    these dangers is that every operator should discuss transparently with one another.
    It tackled the issue of exchange costs for self-ruling operators. However, there
    emerges an issue of trust between those taking an interest specialist. To handle
    all previously mentioned issues, Kapitonov et al. [[58](#CR58)] recommended the
    utilization of decentralized frameworks (blockchain innovation) for productive
    and secure correspondence between the self-sufficient operators in a multi-specialist
    system. Unlike other dispersed records such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, which experience
    high deferrals, being founded on the PoW, the QoS blockchain requires constant
    data updates. In this situation, the opportune execution of a smart agreement
    makes the anchoring of another block to the primary blockchain conceivable in
    real time. Moreover, customers that have additional registering force can get
    UNET tokens as remunerations, in the event that they distribute those unused assets
    into an unordered arrangement. The job of the “QoS chain” is to check the quality,
    throughput and dependability of the system suppliers. It improves administration
    quality, making unchained fit for wide reception. Table [1.5](#Tab5) gives the

    to verify transmission of product-related information. Blockchain gives a changeless,
    conveyed record which enables secure capacity of information. Additionally, it
    may be utilized as a device to forestall malicious IoT gadgets from entering the
    system. In addition to the prudent effect of blockchain innovation on organizations
    as far as operational cost, it can conceivably assist with relieving lawful charges
    emerging from questions. The primary segment of blockchain innovation is smart
    agreements which can empower programmed instalment of products upon their receipt,
    and thus eliminate the requirement for an outsider affirmation. Another significant
    angle is to resolve debates with respect to whether a wholesaler is qualified
    for a volume motivation refund. This can be addressed by utilizing smart agreements
    combined with 5G to follow a shipment. Casado-Vara et al. [[60](#CR60)] proposed
    a model of supply chain, where the purpose of blockchain is to give security to
    the data of organizations associated with the agrarian supply chain alongside
    multi-operator frameworks for viable coordination of inside exercises. It shows
    the theoretical design of a supply chain and the executives with blockchain. This
    model empowers another market model called circular economy. It utilizes the “Make–Use–Recycle”
    model, as opposed to the current “Take–Make–Dispose” model. It permits the economy
    to act naturally sufficient. Unlike physical resources, utilities do not have
    a stock of their basic digital resources. Also, they do not have the capacity
    to follow the various exercises related to programming and equipment, for example,
    their turn of events, shipment and establishment, which sometimes make the frameworks
    vulnerable to outside digital assaults. The utilization of blockchain for this

- en: The utilization of BC in smart farming that focuses on SCM remains a supporting
    area in which a definitive solution for farming is utilized to contribute to different
    distributed agent resource chains. For the food supply chain, customers are typically
    the last stop [[64](#CR64)]. In a case study, ICT[4]Ag was recognized with executing
    the planet’s initial settlement sale made from 21 tons of feed using BC in 2017\.
    This achievement by ICT[4]Ag demonstrated that it remains a great idea to some
    businesses to consider a possible supply chain utilization within the farming
    source chain. Nevertheless, food quality must be monitored to ensure it is not
    jeopardized, which calls for a good food’s traceability process, overseeing the
    product quality and security throughout the whole farming source chain. In response
    to this concern, Lin et al. [[62](#CR62)] recommend a reliable nourishment discoverability
    system, dependent on an IoT inside the surroundings. It depends upon the standard
    Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) history process, which comprises a new innovative
    IoT feature. A customer can use any node (for SCM) to use the smartphone to access
    the decentralized storage information. Additionally, Zhang et al. [[65](#CR65)]
    recommended a 5G-enabled IoT, according to the discoverability process used for
    farming and nourishment resources, particularly for the Asian sector that dealt
    with the food security problems. Table [2.6](#Tab6) explains the existing mechanisms
    and models/frameworks in agriculture.Table 2.6

    of smart farming, other than the farming source chain, is the smart sprinkler
    system that is designed for more efficient utilization of irrigation water. The
    accessible freshwater amounts around the world help the subscribers to develop
    particular ways to make use of irrigation water prudently, considering the developments
    in science and solutions for IoT, cloud computing, and Big Data. Hands-free operation
    of sprinkler system methods accompanied by winter imaging is a possible option
    for an intelligent sprinkler system that measures warm water amounts within the
    ground and regulates the actuators to irrigate. It enhances the regular electric
    sprinkler system, thus designing a much more controlled water consumption utilization.
    Sushanth et al. [[67](#CR67)] recommended a general smart farming process using
    IoT and cloud computing concepts. A farmer is enabled by it to develop a useful,
    achievable sprinkler system routine for their farm based on users’ preferences.
    In line with the agriculturalist’s involvement, an automated smart sprinkler device
    is installed, which supplies the appropriate agenda for farm fields. Next, the
    pertinent receptors and actuators performed a specific process to manage the warm
    water amount while the sprinkler system was complete. A comparable item was suggested
    by Pallavi et al. [[68](#CR68)], where they recommended a management process for
    greenhouse farming using IoT products to remotely realize pertinent details. The
    objective of the producer was to encouraging natural agriculture while enhancing
    the yield. The variables considered incorporated skin tightening and emission,
    soil moisture, temperature, and lighting.

    unchallengeable distribution for BC that allows protected depository space for
    information. Furthermore, it may be employed to stop the incidence of harmful
    products of IoT in the system. Aside from the affordable effect of storage engineering
    on businesses within functional price terminology, it can help mitigate authorized
    charges arising from conflicts. The primary element is an intelligent agreement
    that can allow automated transactions of the products on their receipt, eliminating
    the demand for a third-party confirmation. Another essential part is eliminating

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain technology is becoming popularized as digital currency in the form
    of Bitcoin all over the world. It is termed as a distributed database for carrying
    out transactional operations online and has justified its efficiency and benefits
    in terms of its key attributes, federalization, secrecy, tenaciousness and controllable
    features for translating the conventional industrial system [[1](#CR1)–[3](#CR3)].
    On the same hand, 5G is becoming more popularized in mobile technological industries
    because of its ability to interconnect heterogeneous devices with its broadband,
    remission services, machine-like communication [[4](#CR4)] and enhanced qualitative
    throughput. 5G has revolutionized the communicational network system with a new
    set of attributes that have improved the criteria like network security, reliability
    and ability with smaller latency [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)]. Such a communicational
    network has brought a complete makeover in the industrial organizations in terms
    of high speed, virtualization among the business sectors and establishing the
    connection between Internet-operated devices, applications as well as objects.
    The 5G network [[7](#CR7)] has also created many new opportunities for customers
    as well as business organizers and industries by providing a facility to interconnect
    communicating devices that can control and connect all spheres of human lifestyle
    and services. There are several technical supports like software-defined networking
    (SDN), cloud computing, network functions virtualization (NFV), edge computing,
    network slicing and D2D communication that have strengthened the power of 5G network
    [[8](#CR8), [9](#CR9)]. So 5G network empowered mobile communicating devices are
    required to be assisted with online digital payment platforms which in turn can
    be provided by blockchain technology. Again along with the power of 5G communicating
    technology, many challenges need to be handled like trustworthiness of network,
    permanency of data, isolation and secrecy of data [[10](#CR10)]. On the other
    hand, Blockchain being popularized in the digital era can efficiently handle the
    challenges that have been put forth by 5G networks. So blockchain technology with
    an intent to make the most of cryptocurrency applications [[11](#CR11)] can be
    associated with a 5G network to more securely carry out digital online transactions
    to prove the positive potential of it. In the recent smartphone being manufactured,
    the concept of hardware wallets that makes use of hardware cryptocurrency and
    empowers the blockchain transaction to be conducted safely over 5G communication
    networks taking the real benefit of 5G networks has been developed. So the features
    of blockchain can be thought of as a supporting hand for all sorts of future network
    technologies [[12](#CR12)].

    for 5G communications as well as to review how blockchain technology can tune-up
    with it as a fused component with an objective of considering it as one of the
    driving factors for the development of next-generation 6G network services. Further,
    the chapter flows with the description of the concepts of blockchain and its smart-supportive
    features for the 5G communicational network in Sect. [2](#Sec2) followed by Sect.
    [3](#Sec5) that briefs the potential features of 5G communication networks. Section
    [4](#Sec7) narrates the fusion of blockchain technology with 5G-enabled smart
    automated applications. Then several challenges and issues that are assisted by
    the technological revolution [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)] are addressed in Sect.
    [5](#Sec10) to outline the future research direction followed by conclusions in
    Sect. [6](#Sec11).

- en: Blockchain technology has been adopted in various market segments because of
    its potentiality as well as several benefits. Such distributed technology has
    been adopted in various applications starting from cryptocurrency, IoT and finance-related
    transactions to various social and risk-oriented tasks and thus is expected to
    carry out day-to-day activities [[15](#CR15)]. Initially, this technology has
    been used in terms of digital money named Bitcoin which in turn is described as
    a protocol in the digital communication network. In a better way, blockchain can
    be thought of as a decentralized composition of digital transactions which is
    not under the control of individual or company. Again, the technology is named
    so as because old blocks are not altered or tampered by anyone and new blocks
    get linked with the existing blocks resulting in a formation of a chain. Blockchain
    has a stringent set of rules and structure that makes sure that data can only
    be inserted into the database without doing any alteration to the existing ones
    which in turn is a long and complicated process of back tracing the entire history
    of transactional data. Moreover, we can say that blockchain is a group of shared
    and linked transactional emergent data that are stored digitally in the form of
    a ledger. The security aspects in blockchain are maintained by cryptographic techniques,
    digital authenticating signature and distribution agreement that allow freeness
    of mind among the people to accumulate, swap over and observe the information
    in a digital platform securely. Blockchain, with a growing transactional data
    characterized by date and time stamp, is decentralized and dispersed around the
    communicational networks with the security rules enforced that all the interaction
    done through it would be visible to all the users, but require authentication
    verification before augmenting any information into it. On the same hand, users
    would be able to update the existing data block to which they have been granted
    access, and the same would be reflected in the entire network. Prior application
    of blockchain was named through Bitcoin which is regarded as a digital coin to
    make business. The successful application of Bitcoin has enabled the utilization
    of blockchain technology in different fields like healthcare facility, IoT, finance-related
    services, official document management and tracking, insurance-related services,
    supply chain management, tourism services as well as handling cyberthreats and
    criminals.

    updations if made to it. So blockchain technology has maintained a trust and security

    defends itself to be completely transparent as every user in the network is provided
    with the total history of blockchain and each of them is allowed to check and
    verify the transaction. The user connected to the network with a computer and
    Internet connection is treated as a node which is allowed to take part and obtain
    the consensus. The main advantage of such architecture lies in hiding the user
    credentials. A peer-to-peer transaction is built up to emphasize decentralization.
    Such architecture also makes sure that every transaction is linked with blockchain
    prior to its updation in the system and thus gets synced with each and every node
    in the network of blockchain.![../images/501059_1_En_3_Chapter/501059_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_3_Chapter/501059_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png)

    i.e. only authorized nodes are allowed to participate. The transaction can only
    be validated and verified by authorized nodes being initiated by a company or
    organization. Such a feature in the private blockchain architecture enhances the
    verification and validation process effectiveness. In comparison to the public
    blockchain, private blockchain keeps the users’ information more private by sanctioning
    the access privileges for them. Such architecture is more inclined towards conventional
    modelling and e-governance. The private blockchain is more adopted by the private
    and government sectors because of the security provided by the central authority
    as well as for its enhanced efficiency and faster transactions.![../images/501059_1_En_3_Chapter/501059_1_En_3_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_3_Chapter/501059_1_En_3_Fig3_HTML.png)

    scalable and configurable. Such beneficial features are obtained through a variety
    of software that runs on the hardware platform as per user demand and network
    virtualization as well as network slicing. Network slicing frees the user from
    the control panels and introduces dynamic network applications and services leading
    to ubiquitous platform and infrastructure. The main aim of 5G network is to transform
    all conventional manual services into automated qualitative services with high
    data transmission rates. On the same hand, it also aims to overcome the limitations
    of 4G networks. SDN feature of the 5G network is responsible for the simplification
    of operations and services by separating the control panel from the data panel.
    The centrally placed control has the responsibility of controlling the network
    resources with the help of API that is programmed. Also, network functions virtualization
    is meant for providing flexibility in carrying out network functions by making
    an impression of the virtual detachment of hardware platforms from various software-oriented
    services which results into virtualized gateways, firewalls as well as a network
    that is flexible enough to fulfil the demands of user applications. In addition
    to that, cloud computing platform solves the limitation of data storage to keep
    at par with the growing network traffic created due to the connection of IoT devices
    [[27](#CR27)]. So the main focus of the 5G network is to render novel application-based
    services as well as amplified mobile network services with low latency value,
    the flexibility that could improve the quality in comparison to prior generation’s
    network like 3G/4G. But all the benefits of the 5G network should be supported

    It plays a vital role in maintaining the security of the user applications, the
    identity as well as the underlying network. The authentication technique in the
    5G network is handled by a server which takes lots of time even for preliminary
    authentication. As 5G network gives the assurance of zero latency, maintaining
    authentication for devices in the network and UEs, sustaining data confidentiality
    and data integrity, making the network available and having smaller computational
    complexity value and low cost for communication would be very crucial tasks. Further,
    it would require enhanced security mechanisms to make it more secure and beneficial.
    Though there exist security mechanisms for 5G networks to handle data transfer
    and connections, they are not adequate. So there is a need to have more protocols
    that can enforce security restrictions, awareness, storage, data transmission
    and user-demanded software that can form a threat-free valid network. Blockchain
    technology has the potentiality to handle the challenges put forth in the 5G network.
    So the integration of both technologies can show promising opportunities for the
    user to avail the benefits from both [[28](#CR28)–[30](#CR30)].

    conditions for both network and computing performances. For example, the cloud
    computing or edge computing feature of 5G communications adopts the Amazon cloud
    server which is centralized and can have severe security problems. In addition
    to that, cloud services are mainly popular in fulfilling services as per user
    demand or choice, but the same cannot be achieved if there is a failure at any
    single point. IoT-enabled services with multiple user demands are also not possible
    for a centralized system, if there would be a cyber malware attack. Similarly,
    NFV provides a virtual environment with multiple cloud services that give the
    benefit of function chaining in the 5G network, but it can suffer from leakage
    of data by a few cloud objects. Since the virtual environment is a sharable resource,
    there is a high probability of threats that can hamper the lucidity and liability
    of cloud service providers. On the same note, virtualized servers for NFV run
    through virtual machines that are offering a variety of operating system environment
    with the help of orchestration protocol, leading to a security concern for the
    transmission that is established between a VM manager and an orchestrator. The
    mobile bandwidth data-oriented services like video streaming and a large volume
    of data processing may require an efficient resource management strategy in 5G
    communication so that resource usage can be consistent with the avoidance of scarce
    issues and degradation in performance. Such things can only be achieved by sharing
    through centralization but that would create the possibility of more cyber-attacks
    and decreased quality of service, or an authorized person would be devoid of resources.
    The IoT-enabled services availed through the 5G network making everything smart
    will also face complex security concerns as a large amount of diversified data
    would be generated leading to misidentification of malicious objects causing threats
    [[31](#CR31)]. But there is an absolute requirement by the users to get efficient
    sharing of data along with proper network management assisted with high-throughput
    and elevated security features. So the limitations and security constraints faced
    in the 5G communicational network can be overcome to some extent by the fusion

    being self-sufficient and automated and being visible, secure and verifiable and,
    hence, has the capability of handling the challenges faced by 5G technology concerning
    security and management of the network [[33](#CR33)]. Moreover, the benefits that
    blockchain technology can augment to 5G networks can be grouped under enhanced

    low latency. Keeping this into account, blockchain technology is blessed with
    decentralized nodes with smart contracts that can handle all resource requests
    intelligently without availing centralized authorization. The integration of blockchain
    with 5G communication [[34](#CR34)] can surely enhance the system performance
    with better storage and application service administration along with lower value
    for latency in comparison to conventional SQL-based database platforms [[35](#CR35)].
    The integration of the technology can provide a flexible data transmission model
    with a reduced cost supposed to be incurred against management by making direct
    contact between users and 5G network services. Such a model can still be considered
    as secure since blockchain makes D2D communication among the users and avail the
    computational power from its users to manage the network rather than availing
    from the central authority [[36](#CR36)]. Thus, it can achieve lower latency value
    for communication, for transactional work as well for data accessibility leading
    to amplified system performance. In addition to that, even if there is a failure
    at any point due to malicious attacks, the network can still remain useful by

    being decentralized, maintaining secrecy, trust, being self-sufficient and automated
    and being visible, secure and verifiable. Though cloud computing has a centralized
    cloud server, blockchain-oriented cloud services facilitate decentralization to
    enforce an unbiased agreement with the consensus of blockchain technology. It
    further ignores the failure that can happen at any node and wins the trust of
    the system as well as the user. Since blockchain technology employs peer-to-peer
    communication that in turn transfers each device in the network, as a blockchain
    node, it can have a copy of the ledger to keep an eye on the transactional data
    to make everything transparent and dependable. In comparison to traditional DBMS,
    the smart contract feature of blockchain technology makes use of the computing
    power of authenticated nodes to allow decentralized transaction validation of
    each node’s access [[37](#CR37)]. Such a smart contract feature can empower the
    5G network with all its services not to be tampered or modified. Further, the
    immutability characteristics provide security and protection against various cyber-attacks.
    Protocols for user access along with logic codes in blockchain technology are
    also capable of providing enhanced authentication mechanisms with contracts that
    can automate the authorization process for its users without revealing their private
    identity information as well as discard the intruding ones for 5G networks. The
    data also remain highly protected in the blockchain platform as those are authenticated
    by hash values and then get added to the blocks. Along with data protection, the
    private data when shared in an untrusted communication medium remains in the total
    control of the blockchain technology that even prevents the users of the node
    to trace their own data [[38](#CR38)].

    The prospective features of 5G communication technology can modernize the existing
    healthcare systems to smart medical facilities with reliable trustworthy services
    [[40](#CR40)]. The blockchain technology highlighted with its relevant features
    like decentralized distributed ledger, improved secure and private platform, qualitative
    service and simplified network management with low cost can be fused with the
    most promising 5G networks to provide better assistance to increase performances
    in healthcare sectors [[41](#CR41)]. Various features of blockchain technology
    like on-demand software can do various network functions through virtualization
    and enhanced storage through cloud computing to promote the delivery of services
    at a faster rate so that a survey can be made on patient’s health conditions at
    a very primary stage. Since blockchain promotes peer-to-peer communication, its
    fusion with 5G network will result in a healthcare database that can encourage
    the storage of validated transactional data as well as all patient communications
    in the distributed public ledger. Since the data would be stored in a secured
    publicly distributed ledger, all the healthcare workers can exchange and share
    data during the treatment process. In addition, home-based portable medical services
    with diversified analysis can also be availed through SDN as well as cloud-based
    modelling. Such portable services are highly secure to maintain communication
    between patients and doctors privately. The smart contract feature enables accessing
    privileges to ensure that healthcare data remains secure from malicious threats.
    The D2D communication enables feature extraction from patient’s private data on
    a high scale which in turn is tagged with hash values and securely placed in the
    public decentralized ledger to get rid of data seeping out and tampering issues.
    Blockchain technology is also proudly implemented in a telemedicine service in
    mobile edge computing that allows the users to use their mobile network and access
    the services. The protocols defined through consensus also ensure that the patient
    is taken care of and is the top priority and optimization is achieved for resource
    allocation and security is maintained for their sensitive information. Also other
    applications for disease detection are able to take a capture of all medical test
    data and store it in an offline medium under the supervision of blockchain technology
    that gives the permission to the patients to access their own medical clinical
    test-related data authenticated with cryptographic hash values to maintain integrity
    checks and transparency of the process. Various cloud-based healthcare solutions
    also adopt the blockchain technology for enhancing the security of electronic
    health-related data. IoT-enabled healthcare devices can maintain the communication
    between cloud-based servers with the help of a protocol meant for communication
    defined under blockchain technology. The mobile app-based cloud blockchain medium
    is also used to record electronic health data accessible between patients and
    doctors. In such type of architecture, data is handled by the smart contract technology.
    So when blockchain is integrated to a cloud computing platform to enable data
    sharing, lower latency value is achieved with efficient data management and security
    in contrast to a centralized cloud-based architecture.

    for sharing the information from IoT devices. Such a system employs fog computing
    mechanism to deal with data from mobile and IoT devices and machine learning techniques
    to carry out the data analysis and storage in secure blockchain ledgers. Blockchain
    technology is also adopted to make an interconnection between smart cities and
    IoT devices with utmost security. In smart cities as cameras and sensors would
    be present everywhere to capture an ample amount of data and to analyse those
    in case of a malicious attack, detecting the object of threat would be a cumbersome
    task. Such challenges can be well handled by the concept of edge computing done
    in a distributive manner. Also secure blockchain can interconnect IoT devices,
    nodes and users to communicate with each other by setting up a decentralized secure
    platform. As blockchain technology is a distributed ledger with a central cloud-based
    server, it provides more benefits in comparison to centralized architecture. In
    a smart city, the transport providers and the travellers communicate through mobile
    in a platform known as Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) which is more prone to malicious
    attacks and data leakage. Such services can be enhanced if integrated with the
    blockchain platform to improve the security of the services offered through a
    mobile platform like smart contract that can enable secure and trustworthy payment
    forum [[18](#CR18)]. The large amount of data generated by IoT devices in a smart
    city can be efficiently and securely handled by cloud-based servers assisted by
    blockchain technology to handle auditing issues leading to assemble a data auditing
    blockchain (DAB) that in turn uses Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT)
    protocol by consensus algorithm. In such type of systems, each cloud server is
    treated as a node in blockchain, and the respective happenings can be stored in
    ledgers that ultimately reduce the risk of malicious attacks and failure at any
    single node.

- en: The development of 5G technology has made a significant impact from traditional
    transport facilities into intelligent transportation systems (ITS) called smart
    transportation with smart vehicles, thereby providing better services to people.
    Smart transportation is an end product of IoT-based communication with vehicles
    in transportation. But due to the centralized architectural system used in such
    types of services, there is a high risk of security threat in a vehicle-to-vehicle
    transmission. Blockchain technology with its all essential features of distributed
    ledger, decentralization, transparency and peer-to-peer communication can set
    up the security protocols for secure vehicle transportation [[43](#CR43)]. The
    technology can help in building up peer-to-peer transmission between vehicles
    and roadside units as well as can set up decentralized storage to store all transactional
    data of electrical vehicles. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is a smart and new device used
    as mobile power storage for a more secure energy platform between the power supply
    and electronic vehicles. The power supply in the smart city gets connected to
    the public blockchain where the communicational data between the supplier and
    user are stored, and thus the payment orders as well as charging and discharging
    information are also circulated by the electronic vehicles. Since authentication
    plays an important role in smart vehicle systems, smart contract can be a good
    approach to authorize and confirm all sorts of transactions related to it [[44](#CR44)]
    with the help of programs. The smart contract also enables authorization of vehicles
    that are registered without mentioning their full details, thereby reducing the
    risk of cyber-attacks. Even distributed SDN features of blockchain technology
    can be used to make a secure VANET [[45](#CR45)] that can deal with heterogeneous
    traffic needs. The important requirement of VANET is to maintain security among
    EVs and V2G for power transmission and trading. So the need of the hour is to
    set up a good versatile trading model that can deal with different services related
    to vehicles. Such demand is fulfilled by blockchain technology by setting up a
    decentralized energy platform so that decentralized ledger is used for secure
    storage. Also smart contract is integrated with EV and V2G to form a combined
    trading platform for authorized low cost and efficient communication and authentication.

    for effective management of electricity resources. But such type of smart management
    of energy can suffer from some shortcomings like convincing the customers for
    reliable electricity metre reading, handling energy system complexity, etc. Such
    limitations can be handled by blockchain technology applications. The research
    is also done to make a replacement of the local grid by trans-active microgrids
    which is an application of blockchain for power supply transactions. In such an
    application, grid nodes are capable of maintaining the privacy of electricity
    trading individually [[52](#CR52)]. The transparency of power consumption is also
    demonstrated with the help of smart contract for smart energy. Even the close
    monitoring and recording of consumption of energy is done with the application
    of blockchain technology. The power trading as well as its price has been optimized

    for data and payload application to happen in less than 1 millisecond [[54](#CR54)].
    To achieve such a latency rate, there is requirement of tight protocols and configuration
    setup to carry out the transactions with high throughput. The public blockchain
    applications in terms of Ethereum and Bitcoin are only able to handle transactions
    up to a range of 10–14 per second, and private blockchain applications can handle
    3000–20,000 transactions per second. So there is a need for further research in
    the future for its expansion and optimization starting from the architecture,
    increasing the size of each block as well as the smart contracts to meet the goal
    of achieving higher throughput. Along with such achievement of goals, trustworthiness
    plays a major factor that is achieved through decentralized distributed ledger
    with security. Such reliability is maintained for information like images and
    symbols, so it requires enhancement for different information options. Blockchain
    architecture itself enables trust and transparency factor, so more collaboration
    works are supposed to evolve with competition, ignoring intermediate competitors.

    and these smart contracts are to be used for 5G networks which enable interconnection
    of IoT devices. The smart contract of blockchain technology is vulnerable to cyber-attacks
    and needs to be securely coded for the 5G network [[55](#CR55), [56](#CR56)].
    Moreover, the smart contract once coded is not further upgradable or modifiable
    in place of any malicious attack by the hackers. So the smart contract code has
    to be further researched for upgradation and reporting of vulnerability issues.

    requirement of every individual, organization as well as government. It has to
    be maintained with 5G network communication too as it deals with customer’s sensitive
    data. The integration of blockchain technology with a 5G network enables privacy
    with an issue that the data that gets stored in the blocks are not able to be
    erased because of its immutable property. Also, blockchain only identifies the
    users’ address and never stores their private information. But Bitcoin applications
    are found to record the personal information of the user to make an exchange of
    the identity information among the users with the public and private key. Even
    the smart contract application and Ethereum are also indulged in the exchange
    of identity information which is a major issue and needs to be dealt with. The
    cryptography security maintained through the public key and the private key is
    supposed to be prone to a man in the middle attack [[57](#CR57)] where a third
    person can come in the middle carrying an un-genuine public key and decrypt the
    sensitive information. Similarly, blockchain technology can be threatened with
    DDoS attacks which can smash away any platform or network and its resources [[58](#CR58)].
    On the same note, Bitcoin technology is prone to selfish mining threat that threatens
    the genuineness of the technology which requires urgent attention.

    the number is not optimized [[59](#CR59)]. In applications like Ethereum, costs
    are calculated in terms of gas units for each transaction, and gas units are the
    energy consumption units for smart contracts. So the costs are also calculated
    concerning the code that is being executed for each transaction. These fees would
    be required more in order to execute complex coding, if involved in the transaction,
    so it needs to be taken careof.

    1.0 to industry 5.0 as per the requirements and the challenges of the respective
    age. The industry 5.0 aims at the co-operation between human and machine to improve
    industrial productions and standards with the skilled manpower. This goal can
    effectively be achieved by utilizing the IoT paradigm that is revolutionized from
    the decades to handle the diversity of applications, *viz. smart homes, smart
    cities, smart grids, healthcare, agriculture, smart industries, and many more*
    efficiently. These IoT-based applications can preliminary be distinguished as
    per consumer IoT and industrial IoT [[1](#CR1)]. The consumer IoT focuses on improving
    people’s life that offers quality living, reduces human efforts, and saves time
    and money. The cIoT applications include smart homes, smart cities, and offices.
    On the other side, industrial IoT combines Operational Technology and Information
    Technology together. It concentrates on improving the devices and services related
    to the industries such as smart machines, sensor devices, food processing, data
    integration and analytics for business purposes. Thus, iIoT contributes in the
    tremendous growth of industries that are now driven by distinct manufacturing,

    Blockchain is called as a peer-to-peer decentralized environment that maintains
    a publicly shared distributed ledger between the participating nodes. It is a
    cryptographically linked chain of time-stamped blocks. Each of these blocks has
    their unique identity in the form of hash value. In addition to the transactions,
    each block also stores its own hash value as well as the hash value of the previous
    block. Hash of the block is calculated based on the data stored in it and hence,

    industry segments, viz. telecommunications-oriented 5G network slice brokering
    and the energy industry-related internal electricity allocation in a housing society.
    In telecommunications system, the 5G network with underlying Blockchain use case
    is proposed that utilizes a 5G network slice broker. This broker facilitates the
    manufacturing equipment so that it can obtain the required slice autonomously
    and dynamically. Moreover, the manufacturing device can lease independently the
    required network slice as per demand, it can approve service-level agreement (SLA)
    and pay for the service according to actual usage using network slicing in a Blockchain.
    Thus, the first use case enables autonomous 5G network resource leasing, brokering,
    payout, and billing in the Blockchain. The second case study is a renewable energy-oriented
    smart grids use case, in which entities within a housing society can balance electricity
    production and consumption among themselves without the control of an external

    with the help of working animals. These methods were sufficient only for a short
    period. As time passed by and the global population grew rapidly, the demand for
    goods also increased subsequently. Existing manufacturing methods posed to be
    time-consuming, tedious, and inefficient to facilitate the production of goods
    on a large scale. Therefore, these challenges led to the advancement of an efficient
    technique called automation.

    and the latest technologies to make a process operate without the requirement
    of manpower. Earlier human input was used to ensure the functioning of these machines.
    However, with the employment of automation, the requirement of human intervention
    is negligible. In its initial stage, automation was a simple assembly line of
    workers that consistently performed repetitive tasks daily. The problem with this
    approach was that the majority of these tasks posed to be monotonous, dangerous,
    and unsanitary. Modern automation has become much more advanced. In terms of industrialization,
    it refers to the use of control devices like information technologies, robots,
    computers, etc., that handles and manages various processes and machines of the
    industry. However, to take full advantage of these benefits, the utilization of
    the Internet of Things (IoT) was crucial.

    and humans through which participating entities can operate, communicate, and
    utilize the collected data. This is done to further boost the manufacturing operations
    and productivity. With the rapid increase in the number of IoT devices every day,
    larger network bandwidth is required. This can be fulfilled by the latest 5G technology.
    Along with network bandwidth, 5G technology also provides other benefits like
    low latency, ubiquitous connectivity, and efficient utilization of energy. However,
    there still exists a lack of security between the communication of the industrial
    objects of the network [[22](#CR22)]. Therefore, blockchain technology is employed
    to provide security to the network.

    This ensures the transparency and authenticity of the received data, that is,
    the data is not altered or modified without the consent of anyone present in the
    network. Any change in the transaction of the network is first verified by all
    the nodes present in the network and then only it is recorded. Along with this,
    these nodes present in the network are also granted permission to acquire and
    transmit the respective transaction. Thus, the primary features of the blockchain
    (such as security, privacy, and trust) induce a positive influence on further
    development and innovation of industrialization.

- en: Currently, there are four stages of industrial automation as illustrated in
    Fig. [5.3](#Fig3). The first industrial revolution is known as industry 1.0 started
    during the late eighteenth century. Steam and water-powered machines were developed
    to replace human labor so that efficient production could be achieved. This soon
    got replaced by industry 2.0, in which machines that operated on electrical energy
    were developed to massively further improve the work rate and reduce the expenses.
    This is because unlike the machines powered by water and steam, electrical machines
    have proven to work more efficiently. During this period, the first assembly lines
    were also designed to promote mass production. Later with industry 3.0, the use
    of electronics and computers first started to automate the process of manufacturing.
    This helped immensely to enhance speed, accuracy, and productivity. This was soon
    replaced by the current era we live in—industry 4.0\. Industrial automation is
    the cornerstone of industry 4.0, which majorly compromises of various Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS) such as manufacturing facilities, storage, systems, smart grids,
    and smart machines. This involvement of CPS helped in essentially creating a fully
    automated environment to ensure that no human intervention is necessary to execute
    the required tasks.![../images/501059_1_En_5_Chapter/501059_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_5_Chapter/501059_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png)

    cryptographic identifier called a hash, and the hash of the previous block. The
    data stored in the block can be anything and it depends upon the application.
    For instance, the bitcoin blockchain stores information about the buyer, seller,
    and the amount. The function of the hash is to uniquely identify the block and
    its contents. It is just like our fingerprint, unique in nature and specific to
    each block. However, the hash is created by a hash function that maps the block
    data of arbitrary size into a single fixed value size. The third element of the

    thousands of hashes per second. This means that the data in the block can be easily
    tampered as all of the hashes of other blocks can be recalculated to make the
    blockchain valid. Therefore, blockchain compromises of the proof of work algorithm
    to overcome this challenge. The proof of work is a mechanism that helps to slow
    down the process of the block creation process. Another way in which blockchain
    gains security is by being distributed. That is, rather than employing a central
    entity to manage the network, blockchain utilizes a peer to peer network. This
    means that anyone who enters the network gets a complete copy of the blockchain.
    In addition to this, every node in the network has the right to verify a new block

    is that its architecture is decentralized in nature. Therefore, its integration
    with IoT helped to eradicate centralization and make transactions more secure
    and transparent. Apart from this, the employment of blockchain with IoT provides
    the following additional benefits:'

    become more transparent. Through it, all the nodes are now able to share the same
    information that can be updated via consensus. To change a single transaction
    record, all the transactions present in the network would need to change, which
    is not possible. This allows anyone in the network to view all the information
    present in the network. Furthermore, it also helps to ensure that the data on
    the network is transparent, accurate, and consistent. Therefore, this feature
    can benefit various industries like real estate, automotive, manufacturing, etc.

    cyber-attacks. This is because of the way the transactions are stored in the network.
    That is, first the transaction must be validated by the nodes present in the network,
    only after it is approved that it is encrypted and linked to the previous transaction.
    Furthermore, the information stored is the same across all the nodes present in
    the network. This is the reason why it can be difficult for hackers to alter or
    change the stored data. This feature would therefore immensely help in industries
    such as healthcare, government, finance, etc., to protect sensitive data. Thus,
    blockchain can help to prevent any unauthorized activity that can occur on the
    stored data.

    origin. That is, it helps industries whose products have to go through a complex
    supply chain. This is because blockchain helps to store information related to
    the present status of the transaction such as how the goods are manufactured,
    shipment location, how they are managed, etc. As this data is immutable and can
    be easily shared with the supply chain network, it, therefore helps to provide
    extensive tracing and tracking abilities. Whenever the transfer of goods is recorded
    on the blockchain, the entire journey of the blockchain can be seen. This helps
    to provide validation to the authenticity of the assets in industries like drugs,
    agriculture, etc.

    help to create a sense of trust and transparency for the consumers regarding the
    products they buy. It can also help in enhancing the productivity and efficiency
    of smart farming. For example, the data gathered by the IoT devices can now be
    stored in a blockchain and be executed for particular actions. This would, therefore,
    help to enhance the quality of the crop and the quality of farming.

    This feature is useful for energy resources that are renewable like wind and solar
    energy. This would thus allow prosumers to enter the market and act as suppliers
    too. Moreover, by employing a decentralized architecture, the consumers can now
    purchase energy suppliers directly from the utility providers. This would help

    and experimentation. Since the data stored in a blockchain is immutable, it also
    does not allow any tampering of this sensitive data stored. It can also protect
    the privacy of the patient. That is, sharing of the patient data to a third party
    like pharmacies can be done with protecting the identity of the patient.

- en: Automation of industrial processes, to meet the conservative business goals,
    is ever increasing with the help of modern technologies such as IIoT and 5G. IIoT
    facilitated cooperation among the multiple connected entities for intelligent
    decisions and subsequent actions. The latest 5G technology has provided the required
    support for real-time, reliable, and low-latency communications. With so many
    crucial advanced process control and data analysis applications depending on the
    IIoT network, there is an increased need for proper access control. Blockchain
    offers a decentralized tamper-proof robust mechanism for transaction management,
    which is well-suited for IIoT applications. Blockchain technology in 5G-powered
    IIoT showed a wide variety of applications and industries started adopting them.
    This trend is going to continue and benefit various industrial sectors. In parallel,
    there will be lots of research to improve the scalability, cost efficiency, and
    standardization of blockchain technology.
