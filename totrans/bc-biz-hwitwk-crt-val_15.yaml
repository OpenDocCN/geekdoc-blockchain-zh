    It will become a household name in times to come. The blockchain technology can
    be used for wide range of services such as making secure online transactions,
    creating digital identifications, improving eﬃciency of supply chain, and can
    be used to create data backup which can’t be mutated. It can be utilized by hospitals
    for maintaining patient records. The blockchain technology provides much needed
    privacy for patient data. The crime control agencies can use blockchain technology
    for tracking ownership of weapons. The future applications of blockchain technology
    are numerous and it is very diﬃcult to explain it in a single chapter. However,
    the topics such as community supercomputing, blockchain geonomics, blockchain
    learning, community coin, monetary and non-monetary currencies, some prominent
    alternate coins, demurrage currencies have been discussed in detail.

- en: Community supercomputing is a novel concept and blockchain is the underlying
    technology which helps to make it possible. The world population is 7.8 billion
    plus and the number of connected devices is 22 billion plus worldwide. This number
    is bound to grow exponentially with the rise of new technology like Internet of
    Things (IoT) where all the devices will be converted into smart and communicating
    devices. The community supercomputing wants to take advantage of the hardware
    devices which are used by people for their personal works. An average resident
    uses computing resources for only few hours in an entire day and for major part
    of the day the computing power of a computing device is either underutilized or
    unutilized. In supercomputing, the members of the community pool their hardware
    resources using blockchain technology and create supercomputing. Here the usage
    of community resources will be based on payment basis. If an individual shares
    his computing resources with other members of the community, the computing power
    user has to pay the money to the hardware service provider and vice-versa. This
    concept may become as a source of passive income for community members. As seen
    in [Figure 15.1](#figure1) x-axis and y-axis denotes the length and breadth of
    any typical city. The connected thin lines depict interconnected computer. The
    multi-color filled circles depict blockchain-based supercomputers by using the

    person is infected by the contagious disease, that person acts as a spreader and
    other people are infected by him. Once it is identified that an individual is
    having symptoms of the communicable disease, it becomes vital to trace the contacts
    of that person. A person may infect others during interaction with others at various
    places such as oﬃce, park, neighborhood, etc. The block chain makes use of distributed

    the spread of disease. The inherent feature of blockchain technology helps to
    avoid hacking of disease related data. Duplicity of data can also be avoided using
    blockchain. The disease related records created by blockchain are immutable, decentralized,
    deterministic, data integrity and resilient to attacks. The workgroups involved
    in contagious disease control belong to various independent departments such as
    hospitals, pathology laboratories, police, municipality, disaster management,
    etc. The blockchain infrastructure can play a key role in providing coordinated
    efforts and thus it will eventually help in controlling the epidemic ([Figure

    an early stage and it will be helpful in treatment of many diseases. Several diseases
    which are genetic in nature can be controlled. However, a large amount of data

    and digital signature for asset transfers. This combination can be used for peer-to-peer
    networking and decentralization. In certain scenarios either proof-of-work or
    proof-of-stake scheme is used to create and manage the currency. It permits electronic
    money systems to be decentralized. Bitcoin is most popular form of cryptocurrency,
    a peer-to-peer electronic monetary system based on cryptography. The asset class
    which can be exchanged against cash is known as monetary currency. The monetary
    asset can be converted in cash, if there is a need. The amount of money lying
    in any bank account, fixed deposits in any bank and the cash in hand comes under
    monetary assets. Blockchain-based virtual currency is a type of unregulated digital
    currency that is only available in electronic form. It is stored and transacted
    only through designated software, mobile or computer applications, or through
    dedicated digital wallets, and the transactions occur over the internet through
    secure, dedicated networks. Virtual currency is considered to be a subset of the
    digital currency group, which also includes cryptocurrencies, which exist within
