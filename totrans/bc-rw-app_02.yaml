    and an open distributed ledger can be integrated into a digital business. DLT
    refers to the technical infrastructure and protocols that allow simultaneous access,
    verification, and updating of records in an irreversible manner over a network
    spanning multiple entities or locations. It could be a blockchain, Directed Acyclic
    Graph, Hashgraph, Holochain, or Tempo (Garg, 2017).

    that verifies and approves each transaction by leveraging the resources of a large
    peer-to-peer network. The major advantage of using blockchain for digital currency
