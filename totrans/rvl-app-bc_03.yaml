- en: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been a matter of serious concern
    for network administrators in the last two decades. These attacks target the resources
    such as memory, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth in order to make them unavailable
    for the benign users, thereby violating availability, one of the components of
    cyber security. With the existence of DDoS-as-a-service on internet, DDoS attacks
    have now become more lucrative for the adversaries to target a potential victim.
    In this work, the authors focus on countering DDoS attacks using one of the latest
    technologies called blockchain. In inception phase, utilizing blockchain for countering
    DDoS attacks has proved to be quite promising. The authors also compare existing
    blockchain-based defense mechanisms to counter DDoS attacks and analyze them.
    Towards the end of the work, they also discuss possible future research directions
    in this domain.

- en: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is considered one of the most devastating
    attacks nowadays. DDoS attacks attempt to disrupt the normal working of the network
    by targeting a server, service, or network (Mirkovic et al., 2004). It forwards
    a massive flood of internet traffic towards the target and makes the normal users
    suffering from denying the service of the network’s resources. DDoS attacks target
    the system’s resources, such as bandwidth, CPU, and memory. These attacks can
    be utilized in both wired and wireless network scenarios. DDoS attacks can create
    massive destruction in the network in a short duration. Therefore, providing efficient
    defense solutions against these attacks to secure the network is very important.
    Recently, several defense mechanisms have been proposed (Elsayed et al., 2020;
    Tripathi et al., 2016; Tripathi et al., 2018). DDoS attacks are increasing rapidly
    with time. The average size of DDoS attacks was 26.37 Gbps in 2018 as per a DDoS
    attack statistics report provided by Lawrence Abrams (Abrams, 2018). The largest
    DDoS attack had been reported on “Github” with a very high rate of 1.35 Tbps before
    2020 in the history (Sam Kottler, 2018). However, the year 2020 is proving itself
    a more successful year for DDoS attackers and hackers. In February 2020, Amazon
    Web Services (AWS) was targeted with a rate of 2.3 Tbps DDoS attack that was defended
    by AWS shield – a security service to protect against DDoS attacks (Cimpanu, 2020).
    This attack has been reported as the largest DDoS attack ever in history. In 2020,
    DDoS attackers have become more active that increased the chances of attacks.
    DDoS attackers are also taking advantage of exploiting the global pandemic “COVID-19”
    (Wikipedia, 2020). Most of the people are working on a remote basis that requires
    online or internet access. Every person/organization is dependent on online services
    for their daily life routine. These attacks target the online services and overwhelm
    it with a large volume of network traffic. Government and educational organizations
    have also been targeted during COVID-19 lockdown with higher rates (Palmer, 2020).
    In March 2020, servers of an agency “US department of health and human service
    (HHS)” were exhausted for a duration of time (Bannister, 2020). Preventing DDoS
    attacks completely may not always be possible, but the impact of the attack can
    be reduced. Research work should be done to mitigate these destructive attacks
    and efficient attack defense systems should be developed. In the last few years,
    a new trending technology named “blockchain” (Li et al., 2020) has been introduced
    to prevent and mitigate the DDoS attack. Blockchain is basically a collection
    of records. These records are also called blocks and hence the reason for its
    name that is blockchain. The blocks are interconnected with each other using cryptographic
    techniques. Blockchain and DDoS work in the opposite way. Blockchain is a distributed
    technology, whereas DDoS attack is based on centralized server. As blockchain
    is a distributed/decentralized technology, it allocates the information to the
    different nodes, which makes it difficult for attackers to destroy the functioning
    of the whole network by targeting a specific system. Attackers have to gain access
    to the nodes to make the attack successful. This process makes the attack launching
    difficult and time-consuming. Another advantage of blockchain in reducing the
    success of DDoS attacks is that it stores the information/data on ledgers, which
    uses encrypted blocks. This feature denies the third party to access or make any
    updating, which makes it more secure. Blockchain uses key management (private
    keys) to permit the users for communicating with each other. Therefore, blockchain
    can play an important role in mitigating DDoS attacks.

- en: A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) (Swami et al., 2020) attack is a malicious
    attempt to disrupt regular traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by
    overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet
    traffic. These attacks achieve high throughput by utilizing multiple compromised
    computers or networked resources like IoT devices (Cloudflare, 2020). Most of
    the targeted resources are bandwidth, CPU usage, and memory of the system (server).
    It aims to deny the services for legitimate customers, which degrades the performance
    of the network system. Figure 1 shows a general structure of DDoS attack.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary goal of DDoS attack is to exhaust or overload the resources of the
    target. The impact of DDoS varies from a minor inconvenience to severe financial
    losses for enterprises that rely on their online availability. The attackers'
    motivations are diverse, ranging from simple fun (hacktivist) to financial gain
    (business competition) and ideology (political, terrorist, etc.) (Radwire ltd,
    2019). DDoS attack accounts for around 8% of all cyber-attacks in the previous
    year. From recent studies, the trend shows that DDoS is continuously evolving
    in terms of frequency, volume, and duration. For example, over 80 percent of DDoS
    attacks in 2018 were of short durations and lasted less than 10 minutes, but of
    these attacks around, 20 percent of DDoS victims were targeted again within 24
    hours. The size of DDoS attacks increased 73 percent in Q1 2019 versus Q1 2018
    (Infosec newsflash, 2019). One reason for the increase in the volume of the attacks
    is the availability of weekly secured end devices, IoT devices, and underground
    marketplaces offering for sale access to compromised systems. Table 1 presents
    some of the most famous and recent DDoS attacks.

- en: The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention. It is a system of recording
    information in which the history of any digital asset is unalterable and transparent
    by the use of decentralization and cryptographic hash technology. A blockchain
    alias distributed ledger is a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated
    and distributed among the computer systems in the entire blockchain network (Euromoney,
    2020). Each block in the blockchain contains several transactions, and once a
    new block is added to the blockchain, a copy is added to every participant's ledger.
    The working flow of blockchain is explained in Figure 3\. The birth of blockchain
    is generally considered to be in late 2008 with the publishing of a whitepaper
    introducing a decentralized P2P electronic cash system called bitcoin using the
    pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The introduction of Bitcoin was clearly a significant
    milestone and provided further advancement in the field of P2P and blockchain
    itself. But like many other innovations, bitcoin is also built on previous technologies
    (Beyer, 2020).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of blockchain was first described in 1991 (17 years before the bitcoin
    paper) by scientists Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They introduced a system
    using a cryptographically secured chain of blocks to store time-stamped documents,
    which in 1992 was further enhanced with Merkel trees (Haber et al., 1991). This
    enhancement improved the efficiency of the system by allowing multiple documents
    to be stored in a single block. But this technology went unused, and the patent
    lapsed in 2003.

- en: Bitcoin, the first blockchain, came into existence on 3^(rd) January 2009 with
    the first coin mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2013, another major milestone in
    blockchain technology came into existence. Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder
    of bitcoin Magazine, pushed for a malleable blockchain due to the programming
    limitations in bitcoin. Due to refusal from the bitcoin community, he sets off
    the development of a second blockchain called ethereum. Ethereum introduced the
    concept of “smart contracts” - a turing complete piece of software that can be
    processed on ethereum blockchain, which fulfills the established set of criteria
    (Beyer, 2020). A smart contract can be created with a few lines of code and is
    intended to automatically execute or save legally time-stamped events or activities
    according to the set of rules contained in it. Ethereum can process any type of
    smart contract without the necessity of creating a special-purpose blockchain
    infrastructure. While bitcoin is designed for a single function, i.e., currency
    transactions, with a single smart contract, the ethereum blockchain is has a more
    robust design using a decentralized computer network on which any kind of smart
    contract can be programmed (Beyer, 2020). Fascinated by the potential of smart
    contracts, this technology has attracted the attention of many major IT giants.
    Enterprise Ethernet Alliance is one such formal organizations formed by members
    from leading IT companies for further advancement of the technology (Medium, 2020).

    ledger or blockchain varies from user to user. In the case of digital cryptocurrency
    like bitcoin, the blockchain network should be public because people from all
    over the world can become a node, verify other nodes and trade bitcoins. On the
    other hand, network in baking sector should be restricted towards the users to
    maintain the confidentiality of information. Broadly, blockchain is classified

- en: Rodrigues et al. (2019a) proposed a collaborative mechanism between autonomous
    systems and customers for the mitigation of DDoS attacks. The main components
    of this approach are Autonomous systems and Customers, a part of the SDN concept,
    and Smart contracts from blockchain technology. In this implementation, the Ethereum
    blockchain is chosen as infrastructure for signaling due to its features like
    publicly available, smart contract generation is possible as well and a new block
    is created every 14 seconds. OpenFlow protocol of SDN is used as a monitoring
    framework at gateways to analyze the traffic. The participants of this system
    need to create a smart contract initially. While customers have the right to write
    into the blockchain, the ASes possess both writing and reading rights of the blockchain.
    If any AS or customer comes under DDoS attack, the list of IP addresses of the
    attackers is stored in the smart contract. The updated list of addresses will
    be received to the subscribed ASes to confirm the authenticity of the attack by
    analyzing the traffic and verifying the authenticity of the target. Once the addresses
    are confirmed, different mitigation strategies can be applied to prevent the attack
    according to the policies of the domain. The authors suggest near-source mitigation
    as an ideal strategy in these scenarios for the better health of the internet.
    This prevents the cost of forwarding packets, as a DDoS attack involves massive
    useless packets. An incentive mechanism is also proposed for mitigation in near-source
    to prevent domains from taking advantage of the cooperative defense.

- en: Javaid et al. (Javaid et al., 2018) proposed a DoS/DDoS mitigation framework
    using blockchain for IoT devices. The proposed framework is based on Ethereum
    blockchain for the attack defense. The Ethereum blockchain is integrated with
    smart contract for defense. In this framework, IoT devices are registered to the
    servers for communicating with other IoT devices. A gas limit is assigned to the
    IoT device for working. The IoT device does not work on the expired limit. The
    server may deregister an IoT device anytime if it does not work correctly or its
    gas limit expires. The server also manages the creation and registration of smart
    contract. The address of a registered smart contract is broadcast to all the available
    IoT devices in the network. The contract maintains a trusted list that includes
    the registered IoT devices. The gas limit for each transaction in the contract
    is fixed at the time of smart contract initialization. The smart contract being
    the main component checks the IoT devices timely. The smart contract performs
    the authorization of the IoT devices. When an IoT device sends a message, smart
    contract checks its trusted node list. If the smart contract finds the address
    of IoT device in the trusted list, then only that IoT node’s message is stored
    in the blockchain otherwise, the message is dropped.

    distributed control. It means that a collapsed node cannot affect the working
    of the remaining system. The distributed architecture also decreases the burden
    of servers. The proposed system is capable of securing the server from flooding
    DDoS attacks. It works on the idea that the server does not get exhausted even
    if all the devices send the traffic at one time at the gas limit. If any of the
    IoT devices are compromised and acts as an attacker, it cannot work beyond the
    gas limit. The system provides both detection and mitigation.

    architecture using IoT devices. The mitigation mechanism is based on a trust list
    for traffic management. Trust list integrates the blockchain with SDN technology.
    It consists of three modules: (1) IoT servers, gateways, and validators, (2) IoT
    applications and devices, (3) edge networks. Trust list is preserved in the blockchain.
    It gives a feedback mechanism between all three components. The trust list allows
    only the trusted devices to be communicated. The trust list defines whether the
    device is trusted or not. It maintains two types of profiles, i.e., service profiles
    and device profiles. These profiles are spread in the network. The service profile
    stores the information related to the trusted IoT server, gateways, and validator.
    The information of trusted IoT applications and devices is placed in the device
    profile. SDN switches are connected at the edge network, which filters the malicious
    network traffic. The controller maintains synergy with the blockchain and accesses
    the information related to services and devices’ profiles. IoT server, gateways,
    and validators maintain the data related to trusted services and devices. The
    controller sends flow rules to the switches to update them to block or allow the
    IoT traffic. The purpose of using a validator is to check the authenticity of
    the IoT devices. Therefore, it makes the DDoS attack restricted at the edge network.

    for DDoS mitigation. The authors have primarily focused on the design, implementation,
    and evaluation of the proposed reputation scheme for BloSS. The key idea behind
    the proposed scheme is to use incentive design for dealing with malicious activity
    by proposing a reputation and a basis to reward schemes. A reputation scheme basically
    gives power to the contributors and consumers of the network to rate entities
    that request protection in a cooperative defense. The proposed scheme consists
    of three modules, namely Mitigation task Index, Storage of Reputation Data, and
    implementation of reputation metrics. The scheme is evaluated on ethereum blockchain
    and it is shown that DDoS attacks are mitigated effectively. The main advantage
    of this scheme is that the reputation management scheme overcomes the problem
    of “false-reporting” and “free-riding” in the cooperative defense. In addition,
    it also prevents Sybil and collusion attacks. The main limitation of this scheme
    is that it uses Proof-of-Work (PoW), which leads to variable block creation times.
    This limitation can be handled by using Proof-of-Authority (PoA). The proposed
    scheme can be improved to detect ballot stuffing and bad-mounting attacks.

    and distributed file storage for IoT. For the development of detection models,
    Random Forest and XGBoost are used. The proposed IDS is evaluated on BoT-IoT dataset.
    The main aim of integrating smart contracts with machine learning based IDS is
    to prevent anomalous transactions in blockchain-IoT systems. The proposed solutions
    have the following steps: (1) the incoming traffic is analyzed by IDS, (2) in
    case the packet is normal the transaction is executed according to the logic included
    in smart contracts, after execution the transaction gets permanently added to
    the blockchain, (3) in case the packet is found to be malicious the then an alert

    a false alarm, then it’s the administrator responsibility to decide whether to
    send transaction to smart contract or not. The experimental results indicate that
    the proposed IDS outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. The main advantages of

    mechanism “Cochain-SC” for DDoS mitigation. It involves two levels of mitigation
    that are intra-domain and inter-domain. Authors proposed DDoS mitigation based
    on SDN for intra-domain level. This mitigation method contains three procedures:
    intra entropy-based, intra bayes-based, and intra-domain mitigation. Intra entropy-based
    procedure is used for measuring the random behavior of the data in the domain.
    Intra bayes-based procedure is responsible for classifying attack and non-attack
    (legitimate) flows using the entropy variations. To mitigate the attack flows
    in the same domain, an intra-domain mitigation procedure is used. For DDoS mitigation
    for inter-domain, a blockchain-based DDoS mitigation approach was proposed by
    authors. This mechanism utilizes smart contracts of ethereum blockchain for mitigating
    the attacks among the different SDN domains. For this purpose, an approach is
    developed to allow secure communications among the other SDN domains and attack
    information exchange in a distributed way. Thus, it is observed that an integration

    implementation purpose, an emulator “mininet” is used for creating a real network
    scenario of SDN. sFlow-RT is used for monitoring the network flows and Floodlight

    exchange related to DDoS attacks as an extended work proposed by Yeh et al. (2019).
    The proposed mechanism utilized consortium blockchain. All the nodes are required
    to be authenticated to share the information related to DDoS attacks. The proposed
    mechanism is comprised of four modules that are smart contract, swarm, security
    operation center (SOC), and decentralized oracle service. Smart contracts are
    used to control the complete flow on the platform. Swarm is responsible for storing
    logs of encrypted IP lists of DDoS attacks. SOC is used for monitoring any malicious
    activity in the network. Decentralized oracle service are used for handling the
    events raised from smart contracts to take any action for privacy protection.
    The goal of the proposed mechanism in terms of security is to maintain the confidentiality
    and integrity of IP lists of DDoS attacks. Each SOC can behave like an uploader,
    buyer, and data verifier to share the security information with other SOC. For
    this purpose, some DDoS coins as virtual coins and two kinds of reputation points,
    i.e., positive reputation and negative reputation are used. These coins and points
    are managed by SOCs. Further, the proposed system includes two phases, namely
    upload phase and purchase phase. In the upload phase, whenever a DDoS attack is
    detected, SOC uploader uploads the IP list of detected attack to the swarm. The
    uploading of IP list is done in an encrypted form. In the purchase phase, buyer
    receives an IP list of DDoS after going through security checks and decrypt the
    IP list to access it.

    CPU power, and memory) by flooding a huge amount of network traffic towards a
    system. DDoS attacks can cause a massive destruction to the network. Even when
    the whole world is facing a global pandemic “COVID-19” and trying to deal with
    this, the DDoS attackers have come in an active state. All the works related to
    daily routine, professional, institutional, or health are being handled via online
    services. DDoS attackers have the best chance to crash or slow down all the services.
    These attacks should be handled on time before it makes the service entirely down.
    Many prevention solutions have been proposed by researchers and organizations.
    One of the trending technology, “blockchain” is also used for DDoS defense. In
    this chapter, DDoS attacks have been explained in detail with its different types.
    The chapter also discusses the different types of blockchain, and blockchain-based
    defense works against DDoS. Blockchain provides many advantageous features to
    deal with cyber-attacks, whereas it also makes itself vulnerable to attacks. Blockchain
    has some challenges that should be explored. Therefore, some of the important
    research challenges present in the existing blockchain mechanisms have been explained
    in the chapter. The major issue with the field of blockchain is lack of awareness
    and understandability. Blockchain is such a technology that cannot be utilized
    in the existing networking paradigms with less knowledge of its concepts. This
    is why most of the existed research works are lacking in implementations and simulations.
    Thus, blockchain should be studied widely for taking the benefits that can help
    in preventing the cyber-attacks such as DDoS.
