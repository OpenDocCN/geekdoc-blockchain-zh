  zh: 摘要
- en: 'Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) helps maintain and distribute predefined
    types of information and data in a decentralized manner. It removes the reliance
    on a third-party intermediary, while securing information exchange and creating
    shared truth via transaction records that are hard to tamper with. The successful
    operation of DLT stems largely from two computer science technologies: consensus
    mechanisms and information security protocols. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof
    of Work (PoW) and Raft, ensure that the DLT network collectively agrees on contents
    stored in the ledger. Information security protocols, such as encryption and hashing,
    protect data integrity and safeguard data against unauthorized access.'

    的成功运作主要源自两种计算机科学技术：共识机制和信息安全协议。共识机制，如工作量证明（PoW）和 Raft，确保了账本中存储的内容得到了DLT网络的共同认可。信息安全协议，如加密和哈希，保护数据的完整性，并防范未经授权的访问。
- en: The most popular incarnation of DLT has been used in cryptocurrencies, such
    as Bitcoin and Ethereum, through public blockchains, which requires the application
    of more robust consensus protocols across the entire network. An example is PoW,
    which has been employed by Bitcoin, but which is also highly energy inefficient.
    Other forms of DLT include consortium and private blockchains where networks are
    configured within federated entities or a single organization, in which case less
    energy intensive consensus protocols (such as Raft) would suffice. This chapter
    surveys existing consensus mechanisms and information security technologies used
    in DLT.

- en: Blockchain technologies alleviate the reliance on a centralized authority to
    certify information integrity and ownership, as well as mediate transactions and
    exchange of digital assets, while enabling secure and pseudo-anonymous transactions
    along with agreements directly between interacting parties. Since the introduction
    of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto [[1]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0010), blockchain
    technology has been studied by researchers, engineers, and domain experts to evaluate
    its utility and improve its usability. Bitcoin is the first successful application
    of blockchain technology that is widely recognized for its revolutionary mechanisms
    that allow the secure direct transfer of digital assets between involved parties
    without the need for a trusted intermediary.

- en: The concept and importance of digital assets are integral to the inception of
    blockchain technology. A digital asset is anything that exists in a binary format
    that comes with some right to exercise. One type of digital assets is native assets,
    which are assets that lack physical substance, but can be owned or controlled
    to produce some value. Examples of native assets are digital music, images, movies,
    electronic funds, and software. The other type of digital assets is digital representations
    of traditional assets, which are or historically used to exist in paper certificates
    or titles [[2]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0015). Assets like land property, gold,
    automobile title, and “paper” currency are examples of this type of digital assets.

    assets [[3]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0020) in nearly every domain and aspect
    of our lives. For example, the entertainment industry requires digital rights
    management for movies and music; the finance industry has experienced far more
    electronic fund transfers than cash exchanges; the energy sector is moving toward
    digital trading of energy and the adoption of smart grids; social media requires
    the management and protection of online users' reputation; and online elections
    cannot succeed without proper management of votes [[4]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0025).

- en: There are some common operations that can be performed on digital assets to
    augment their usability. For example, digital assets are transferable across different
    entities and users via atomic online transactions, such that they are either executed
    as one unit or not at all. These transactions can take place during a transfer
    between two bank accounts, a record of fund movement between a sender and a recipient,
    or a purchase of merchandise using a credit card. Likewise, the management of
    a special digital asset—digital identity—is important to match these identities
    in various occurrences to reduce the replication of data. Yet another operation
    that may be exercised on digital assets is provenance tracking, in which a digital
    history can be provided for physical products (such as supplies or hardware components)
    to trace and verify their origins, attributes, and ownership [[5]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0030).

    technologies today typically refer to decentralized ecosystems managed by consensus
    mechanisms where the majority of parties (i.e., more than 50%) eventually agrees
    to the same reality. In such decentralized ecosystems, all the data (i.e., transactions
    of digital assets) are structured as a chain of blocks and replicated across all
    network maintainers (miners) [[7]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0040), just like

- en: DLT is an umbrella term that defines any shared ledger (regardless of its internal
    data structure) maintained in a decentralized network that replicates identical
    copies of the data across multiple nodes residing in various geographic locations.
    Nodes in the network simultaneously reconcile their copies of the data through
    consensus to achieve a shared truth, such that data in the shared ledger is verifiable
    and tamper-aware. Key to the success of DLT is the consensus process that helps
    order all valid transactions in a deterministic manner.

    network establish agreement on the value of some shared data [[8]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0045).
    A distributed ledger network can deliver a consistent and reliable state, even
    in the event that one or more nodes may be unreliable due to corruption or hardware
    failure. Unlike a typical centralized system—where decisions are dictated by the
    single governing authority—decisions regarding data stored in a distributed ledger
    are collaboratively made by majority votes. Due to the increasing interest in
    distributed ledger designs, various consensus mechanisms and information security
    protocols have surfaced as common configurations employed in these designs. This
    chapter provides a survey of popular technologies in use or proposed as part of

  zh: 2.1 拜占庭共识机制
- en: Consensus mechanisms in distributed systems can be divided into two categories
    based on whether they assume maliciousness among the agents. In a classic 1982
    paper [[9]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0050), Lamport, Shostak and Pease introduced
    the problem of achieving consensus under malicious failure scenarios. They used
    the example of the Byzantine army and the problem of reaching agreement (consensus)
    to attack or retreat to explain the problem. Using a basic setup of three generals,
    they showed that if even one of the generals became malicious the other two generals
    will not be able to reach consensus. In a general setting, they showed that if
    at most N generals are traitors, then at least 3 N + 1 generals are needed to
    ensure that all non-malicious generals (2 N + 1) agree on the decision as to whether
    to attack or retreat. This result has several interesting applications in distributed
    systems, specially providing a lower bound on the minimum investment needed to
    ensure fault-tolerance.

  zh: 在分布式系统中，共识机制可以根据其是否假设代理之间存在恶意行为分为两类。在经典的1982年的一篇论文[[9]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0050)中，Lamport、Shostak和Pease介绍了在恶意故障场景下实现共识的问题。他们以拜占庭军队为例，讨论了达成一致（共识）以进攻或撤退的问题。利用三位将军的基本设置，他们表明，即使其中一位将军变得恶意，其他两位将军也无法达成共识。在一般情况下，他们表明，如果最多有N位将军是叛徒，那么至少需要3 N + 1位将军才能确保所有非恶意将军（2 N + 1位）就进攻或撤退的决定达成一致。这个结果在分布式系统中有几个有趣的应用，特别是提供了确保容错所需的最低投资的下限。

  zh: 2.2 非拜占庭共识机制
- en: In non-malicious (i.e., Non-Byzantine) failure scenarios the problem is to ensure
    convergence on agreement of a stated value or a sequence of actions even if certain
    nodes fail. Regardless of whether failures are fail stop or fail stuck, the state
    is consistently observed by all participants and they agree that the node has
    failed with the correct stop or stuck semantics. Conversely, in malicious (i.e.,
    Byzantine) cases, a failed node can deceive the other agents into different observations,
    i.e., some nodes might receive one message from the failed node, whereas other
    nodes might receive a different message from the failed node.

  zh: 在非恶意（即非拜占庭）故障场景中，问题是确保在某个声明的值或一系列动作上达成一致，即使某些节点失败。无论故障是故障停止还是故障卡住，状态始终被所有参与者一致地观察到，并且他们一致认为节点已经以正确的停止或卡住语义失败。相反，在恶意（即拜占庭）情况下，一个失败的节点可以欺骗其他代理以获得不同的观察，即，一些节点可能从失败的节点接收到一个消息，而其他节点可能从失败的节点接收到不同的消息。

    can participate in the exchange of digital assets in these platforms. Users are
    incentivized to contribute to the networks by validating transactions in the hope
    of being rewarded with digital tokens that may be used for commodity trading or
    in a shared market. Users are also attracted to public blockchains due to their
    “trustless” [[1]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0010) nature, i.e., users can remain
    anonymous on-chain to protect personal identities and can feel confident that

    transactions that are continually reconciled and verified via a process called
    blockchain “mining.” After a set of transactions is verified by the majority of
    the network maintainers, the transactions are then grouped into a structured block
    as being successfully mined. Consequently, the newly mined block is chained to
    the previous block in the sequence to persist a consistent and ordered transaction
    history, as shown in [Fig. 1](S0065245819300245.xhtml#f0010).

    typically implement the most robust mechanisms to reach consensus in highly decentralized
    global networks. These mechanisms may be more time consuming than others used
    in permissioned blockchains, but they more resilient to attacks from (minority)
    rogue players (in this context, we do not consider the 51% attack where the majority
    of network nodes collude to reverse blockchain transactions). Transactions in

    instance, the puzzle used by Bitcoin results in an average block formation time

    of Stake (PoS). To reduce the energy consumption problem introduced by PoW's need
    for miners to solve a computationally expensive puzzle, PoS determines the next
    eligible block to append to the chain based on the current “stakes” held by the
    accounts, i.e., the total native cryptocurrency tokens they have. Stakeholders
    who are selected to maintain the PoS network are often required to lock in their
    stakes for a period of time during their service. This nature of PoS provides
    incentives for nodes to correctly create and validate blocks because by committing
    to network maintenance with their own shares of tokens, they could risk losing
    their stake and be deprived of their future privilege as a block producer if they
    are dishonest. All the locked shares are returnable to the good and fair stakeholders.
    Moreover, if a block is successfully appended to the blockchain its validator
    is rewarded with some transaction fees [[12]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0065).

    gains advantages due to high stakes in the system, after an account has generated

    PoI determines a user's eligibility of harvesting blocks according to their overall
    contribution to the network, rather than a single aspect, using a more holistic

    the network by disclosing their identities prior to joining the consortium. They
    establish a much smaller and more controlled environment that has a modicum of
    trust among the member nodes. Consensus is therefore much easier and faster to
    achieve in permissioned networks compared to ones completely open to the public.
    Despite the lower degree of decentralization, consensus is still a crucial process
    to ensure that every member has equal rights to updating the shared ledger in
    the network. Below we describe three popular consensus mechanisms used in permissioned
    ledgers. [Table 2](S0065245819300245.xhtml#t0015) presents a summary that compares

  zh: 4.1 时间已过证明（PoET）
- en: In Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), nodes are selected to produce blocks after
    waiting for a random period of time. This technique was developed by Intel and
    has been adopted by the Hyperledger Sawtooth project [[24]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0125)
    as a much leaner alternative to PoW in a permissioned network [[25]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0130).
    Its core mechanism is based on Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology
    [[26]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0135) that has the ability to digitally attest
    that some code has been correctly set up in a so called “Trusted Execution Environment”
    [[27]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0140). In PoET, this code is a function that
    generates a random time period that must be waited out by each node.
  id: totrans-75
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a participant joins the network, they download the time generator code
    and receive an attestation (in the form of a digital certificate) of the code
    setup from SGX that they announce to the network. Existing members can either
    approve or deny the join request. If the request is approved, the new node becomes
    an eligible candidate to produce blocks and participates in the random selection
    process. Whoever first completes the waiting period broadcasts a signed message
    to the network as the randomly chosen next block forger. The SGX is a critical
    component because (1) it warrants the integrity of the randomly generated wait
    period, preventing malicious nodes from altering the timer code to their advantage
    and (2) the attestations are an efficient method to verify the validity of wait
    time completion [[25]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0130). The PoET consensus mechanism
    is illustrated in [Fig. 6](S0065245819300245.xhtml#f0035).

    It creates a randomized model for selecting block producers without resource-intensive
    computing as in PoW systems or complex calculations for determining miners used
    in consensus mechanisms involving stakes in the system as in PoS and PoI. However,
    PoET heavily relies on Intel's specialized, third-party hardware to operate, which
    creates entry barriers for participants without access to the SGX technology.
    It is also possible for nodes with more hardware available to gain a better chance
    of getting selected, but such nodes may likely be denied access to join the permissioned
    network.

    ideally, in permissioned networks. Instead of choosing block miners on the basis
    of their stakes in cryptocurrency tokens, PoA selects a small group of authorities
    as transaction validators by their identity or reputation staked in the network
    [[28]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0145). To contend for validators, users go through
    a formal notarization process in which they provide documentation to prove their
    real identities and link them with their on-chain identities to establish their
    digital reputation. Existing validators can vote to add additional users into
    the authority group. A PoA-based system also rewards authorities for certifying
    and ordering transactions to incentivize honest behavior in providing service
    and moderating the network. PoA Network [[29]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0150)

    among a group of trusted authorities. As a result, this model can introduce censorship
    into the public network where one or more authorities may blacklist or deny all
    transactions from a particular user. On the other hand, a permissioned network
    established between different enterprise or large institutions can benefit from
    PoA because it offers a faster transaction processing speed and the identity-at-stake
    model aligns well with business operations that value trustworthiness and reputation.

- en: Ordering-based consensus is commonly applied in permissioned networks in which
    nodes are selected to participate in the network that supports a membership or
    identity service. A well-known permissioned ledger system, Hyperledger Fabric
    [[31]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0160), implements a three-step process to reach
    consensus in this manner. First, the client application proposes a transaction
    to a set of nodes called “peer nodes” (who hosts of the shared ledger) for endorsement
    based on some predefined policy (e.g., requiring M out of N signatures from peer
    nodes). Peer nodes next return a response of the transaction proposal to the client,
    who then submits the endorsed transaction to a node called the “orderer.” Orderer
    nodes may receive endorsed transactions in different orders, but they collectively
    determine the final, strict sequence of the transactions and package them into
    immutable blocks. Finally, the orderer nodes distribute transaction blocks to
    connected peer nodes for validation of the new transaction blocks. In this model,
    if a transaction is deemed invalid, it remains in the block, but is marked as
    invalid by the peer node because blocks created by orderer nodes are in their
    final states [[32]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0165). [Fig. 8](S0065245819300245.xhtml#f0045)

    sequence of transactions in the ledger. One of the consensus mechanisms from distributed
    computing that is implemented by the ordering service in Hyperledger Fabric is
    a leader-follower model called Raft [[33]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0170). In
    Raft, a single leader node is elected in each “term” of an arbitrary length to
    make decisions and propagate those decisions to the followers who then replicate
    them. Each Raft node maintains a log and is always in one of three states: follower,
    candidate, or leader. A node starts as a follower who accepts and replicates log
    entries from the leader. If a leader is not present or has not been responsive
    for a time period, the follower waits for a randomized timeout period and then
    moves into the candidate state. The candidate then requests votes from other nodes
    and becomes the leader if it receives majority votes from the network. All new
    transaction entries go through the leader, who appends the changes to its log
    and replicates the effective transaction sequence to the followers. The leader
    waits until a majority of followers have updated their local logs and then commits
    the updates and broadcasts the confirmation to follower nodes. The network is
    now in consensus of the transaction sequence and ledger states [[34]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0175).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ordering-based consensus process designates separate roles for verifying
    and ordering transactions. The leader-follower model orders transactions at a
    fast pace because the order is determined effectively by a single leader node
    at a time instead of being computed by every node. It does require configurations
    to set up the architecture but not specialized hardware or extensive computing
    resources, making it a cost-effective model for permissioned ledger systems. The
    leader election process can quickly detect a faulty leader in the network and
    replaces it so that the ledger can be updated continuously as new transactions
    are received. Raft-based ordering service alone, however, is not resilient to
    attacks from malicious nodes that may exist within the network, which requires
    other components in place to validate transactions added by leader nodes, as are
    present in the Hyperledger Fabric system.

    component of distributed ledger technology. It is composed of a pair of mathematically
    related public and private keys generated from one-way cryptographic function.
    While the public key can be freely distributed, the private key must be protected
    by the owner of the key pair. It is computationally infeasible to acquire the
    private key given its paired public key in the cryptographic keys commonly used
    in information security today.

    of messages using the intended recipient's public key to encrypt data packets,
    ensuring that only owners of the corresponding private key can decrypt them. Another
    standard use case is for the sender of data to create digital signatures with
    their private key, with the signatures being easily verifiable using their public
    key, to prevent data from being tampered with in transit. Through public key cryptography,
    public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum provide so-called “pseudo-anonymity”
    [[1]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0010), meaning that as long as users' real-life,
    personal identity is not linked with their public keys on-chain, their activities

    an arbitrary length (e.g., different types/sizes of digital assets exchanged)
    to data of a fixed size (e.g., transaction hashes stored in the shared ledger)
    using cryptographic functions [[36]](S0065245819300245.xhtml#bb0185). These functions
    are one-way, meaning that it is trivial to generate a hash value from a given
    input but impractical (given computation capabilities today) to reverse engineer
    and calculate the input value. Given the same input, hash functions will always
    produce the same output. Moreover, even the slightest change in the input will
    completely alter the output. Hashing is commonly used in blockchains to protect
    transacted data against tampering and link new validated transactions with the
    existing ledger to create a network-wide non-refutable history.

    The goal of this approach is to more securely authenticate transactions than the
    traditional single public-private key pair. Multisig is often employed by cryptocurrency

    prone to insider attacks because anyone with access to the shared secret key can
    withdraw or transfer the balance without being traceable. Multisig is designed
    to overcome these issues by requiring more than a single key pair to authenticate
    transactions. It requires M keys out of a set of N (N > = M) key pairs to perform
    a transaction, with 2 out of 3 keys (M = 2, N = 3) being the most common scheme

    and resilient decentralized network since any node, including malicious node,
    can theoretically become a miner. Permissioned networks, in contrast, are often
    less concerned with malicious nodes because strict rules are in place to onboard
    members to ensure that nodes in the network can be trusted with their reputation
    stake in the network.
