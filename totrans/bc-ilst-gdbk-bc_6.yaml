    business plan, I searched for all significant events in Blockchain’s history,
    marking them on my calendar. However, on the birthday of Bitcoin, I did not realize
    the date until midnight. So I jumped out of bed, opened my computer, and made
    a beautiful poster to celebrate its birthday. At that very moment, all the information
    I collected on my calendar suddenly became useful. Therefore, the first chapter
    of the book has been devoted to introducing the historical facts about Blockchain.
    This book also includes quotations and references from [8btc.com](http://8btc.com)
    and other Bitcoin online forums.

    with, and I was totally confused. For a beginner, it is crucial to study these
    terms before participating in discussions. Therefore, in the second chapter of
    the book, I list the terms I have heard most frequently, and I hope this list
    will help you to some extent.

    when trying to communicate information on an unreliable channel where data are
    lost. Thus, research on consistency usually assumes the channel is reliable or
    functions well. Bitcoin Blockchain, born in 2008, solved this historical issue.[37](#Afn_37)

    is the name of the developer and founder of Bitcoin. In 2008, in a mail group
    that discussed information encryption, Nakamoto published an article outlining
    the basic framework of the Bitcoin system. In 2009, he established an open source
    project for the system, officially announcing the birth of Bitcoin. However, after
    Bitcoin gradually developed into a phenomenon, Nakamoto disappeared from the Internet.
    Many of Bitcoin’s “anniversaries” are related to Satoshi Nakamoto.

    currency specified in digital form, and both digital gold currencies and cryptocurrencies
    belong to digital currencies. It is not entirely equivalent to virtual currency
    in the virtual world, because it is often used for trading real goods and services,
    not simply confined to virtual spaces such as online games. There are now thousands
    of digital currencies in the world.

    of Blockchain, then you will undoubtedly encounter this term, which means “proof
    of work.” Bitcoin employs the PoW mechanism during the generation process of blocks.
    A qualified hash value of a block consists of numerous leading zeros, the number
    of which depends on the difficulty of the network. To get a reasonable hash value
    of a block requires a significant amount of trial and calculation, and the calculation
    time depends on a machine’s hash operation speed.[54](#Afn_54)

    32 bytes. Public keys and the generation of addresses all depend on the private
    keys. With private keys, public keys and addresses can be generated, and Bitcoins
    at the corresponding addresses can be accessed and used.

- en: Hash value is a ubiquitous term in the Bitcoin world. The hash algorithm maps
    an arbitrary-length binary value to a fixed-length and smaller binary value, which
    is called hash value, a unique and extremely compact numerical representation
    of a piece of data. Even with just a change of one letter in a plain text, the
    hash values produced subsequently vary to a great extent. To find two different
    inputs that produce the same hash value is basically impossible from a computational
    point of view.[55](#Afn_55)

- en: A public Blockchain refers to a Blockchain that can be read by anyone in the
    world, and in which anyone can send transaction information, transactions can
    be validly confirmed, and anyone can participate in the consensus process. The
    consensus process determines which block can be added to Blockchain, and it also
    allows participants to understand the current status. Public Blockchains are usually
    considered completely decentralized, while private Blockchains refer to Blockchains
    whose writing permission belongs to only one organization.

    block contains all the transactions that occur across the entire network during
    this period. Each block also contains the ID of the previous block, which allows
    each block to find its previous node, and in such a reverse manner, a complete
    transaction chain is formed. Since its birth to the present day, there is one
    unique main Blockchain in the entire network.

    percentage increasing to 40 percent, and the remaining 60 percent of the shares
    were planned to be raised mainly from the consortium’s forty-two initial member
    banks. Then, seven banks withdrew from the financing. Following R3’s announcement
    that it was making its Blockchain platform Corda an open source one, some members,
    including Goldman Sachs, withdrew from the R3 consortium.[58](#Afn_58)
