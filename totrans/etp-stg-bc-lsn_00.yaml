    scholars, and this book is no different. I have benefited enormously from reading
    and following the writings and opinions of a large number of blockchain researchers
    and entrepreneurs. Blockchain has been sometimes referred to as the bedrock on
    which Web 3.0 will be built, a new version of the internet that draws on decentralized
    peer-to-peer interaction. For many, cryptocurrency is the starting point for their
    voyage into the intricacies of blockchain. And although blockchain has been extensively
    deployed in gestating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, I highlight the extensive
    application potential of blockchain and the underlying distributed ledger technology
    for enterprises and across society.

    every week, and as I researched and wrote this book, I was constantly rewriting
    to reflect this continually morphing space. Hence, writing this book—and reading
    it—is the beginning of a journey. I hope this book stimulates your interest and
    leaves you wanting to learn more.
