    is the process of producing new cryptocurrency or Bitcoins. Owners or operators

    network is an array of data containing the information about transactions that
    hit the network after the previous block was created. A network participant, who
    has figured out the digital signature, is rewarded with cryptocurrency. At the
    same time, to get a “gold bar” in the form of a precious generating transaction,
    a miner needs to sift through tons of “dead rock,” i.e. hashes unfit for the block.

    the system itself. Despite the fact that the client code and the cryptocurrency
    protocol code are fully open, creating new coins is a complex and expensive process.
    For example, you cannot generate more bitcoins than planned by the creator of
    the technology. To get new coins, you need substantial investments in equipment,
    premises, cooling systems, electricity, etc. That is why Bitcoin is called "digital
    gold" and is depicted in the form of gold coins.

    [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/) forum announced the launch of crowdfunding
    for the project. As a result, ICO Mastercoin collected more than 5,000 bitcoins.

    Tokens then were sold for $0.30\. In two years, their value on the exchange increased
    up to $12- $13, and in June 2017 they already cost $390.

    and look for investors, crop up almost every day. The more such projects are created,
    the less of them will be successful. A lot of ICOs are originally set up just
    to fleece people. The number of such projects will only grow as people become
    increasingly interested in making easy money through ICOs.

    support of people who do not have the money to investing ICOs. The bounty program
    was invented just for them. It is an opportunity to get your share of the project
    tokens without investing your own funds. For this, you just need to popularize
    the project.

    success of an ICO is dependent on a number of conditional things. The conventional
    indicator of success is the amount of raised funds. In this regard, the leader
    (at the time of writing this book) is the Bancor project, which raised 396,720
    ETH in less than three hours in June 2017\. An example of another rapid crowdsale
    was the innovative Brave browser campaign, which raised $36 million in the very
    first few minutes of the project. Furthermore, the projects Storj ($30 million
    in less than a week) and Aragon (which collected the required 275,000 ETH, about
    $25 million, in just 15 minutes from the start of the ICO) joined the ranks of
    successful cryptocurrency crowdsales in May 2017.

    million) which crashed the Ethereum network. And we can’t forget about the legendary
    The DAO project, which collapsed and gave birth to Ethereum Classic in summer

    success stories. Some ICOs have the potential to grow dramatically over time and
    to recoup the initial investments manifold. Still, according to some experts,
    most projects in 2017 may turn out to be frauds. It makes sense, as it now easier
    to invest thanks to the virtual economy. People invest their money practically
    sight unseen in any company with a more or less decent presentation. Such a thoughtless
    approach plays into the hands of scammers.
