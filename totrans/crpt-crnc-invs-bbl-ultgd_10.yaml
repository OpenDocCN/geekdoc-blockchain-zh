    is the process of producing new cryptocurrency or Bitcoins. Owners or operators

    computing device needed to spot Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) in the network.

    network is an array of data containing the information about transactions that
    hit the network after the previous block was created. A network participant, who
    has figured out the digital signature, is rewarded with cryptocurrency. At the
    same time, to get a “gold bar” in the form of a precious generating transaction,
    a miner needs to sift through tons of “dead rock,” i.e. hashes unfit for the block.

    fact, it's a great piece of painstaking work, which is rewarded with money by
    the system itself. Despite the fact that the client code and the cryptocurrency
    protocol code are fully open, creating new coins is a complex and expensive process.
    For example, you cannot generate more bitcoins than planned by the creator of
    the technology. To get new coins, you need substantial investments in equipment,
    premises, cooling systems, electricity, etc. That is why Bitcoin is called "digital
    gold" and is depicted in the form of gold coins.

    is tooled for extracting crypto coins. As for GPU mining, an ordinary farm usually
    consists of several video cards of one model, a forceful power supply, a motherboard
    with several PCI-Express slots, and processor with a cooling system. There are
    certain algorithms upon which coins work. You should select video cards depending
    on these algorithms.

    for certain coins, and you will not be able to switch between them. If you choose
    ASIC, you will have to mine successfully enough to pay your electricity bills
    because you’ll need a lot of electronic equipment.

    a “money machine.” You can mine remotely using shared processing power. This type
    of mining is called cloud mining. However, you should beware of the dangers of
    cloud mining. First, the payback period is quite deceptive. Second, you cannot
    control expenses and profit. Moreover, all the equipment is not in your personal
    property.

    first rule of the so-called “mining club” is not to tell anyone where your farms
    are located. Is it a trivial tip? You may think so. But remember that you must

    It is a specific crowdfunding model. ICO participants finance the development
    of a project in return for future benefits. ICO is often compared to IPO. But
    unlike IPO, participants in ICO often do not receive a stake in the company and
    cannot influence the internal management decisions.

    success of an ICO is dependent on a number of conditional things. The conventional
    indicator of success is the amount of raised funds. In this regard, the leader
    (at the time of writing this book) is the Bancor project, which raised 396,720
    ETH in less than three hours in June 2017\. An example of another rapid crowdsale
    was the innovative Brave browser campaign, which raised $36 million in the very
    first few minutes of the project. Furthermore, the projects Storj ($30 million
    in less than a week) and Aragon (which collected the required 275,000 ETH, about
    $25 million, in just 15 minutes from the start of the ICO) joined the ranks of
    successful cryptocurrency crowdsales in May 2017.
