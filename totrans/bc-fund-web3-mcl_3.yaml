    one type of financial service, peer-to-peer payments. In this chapter, we examine
    three other blockchain-enabled applications for financial services. Ripple and
    Stellar are platforms for global payments and currency exchanges that help move
    fiat currencies around the world by using cryptocurrencies as bridges. Aave allows
    individuals to loan and borrow cryptocurrencies. We tell the stories of how these
    applications were founded and where they are today. Taking a deep dive into three
    applications allows readers to apply lessons from prior chapters on governance
    and on how blockchains work. Like any software application, Ripple, Stellar, and
    Aave have governance processes for improving their code bases. We map their services,
    distributed ledgers, digital assets, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, code
    bases, and interfaces to the Blockchain Application Framework.'

    were the first blockchain applications. We’ve learned about many blockchain innovations
    in financial services already. We’ve celebrated Bitcoin as the first blockchain
    application—it is a financial services application for peer-to-peer payments.
    It moves bitcoins from senders’ addresses to receivers’ addresses. In the last

    of these new ways to raise funds for new ventures. Not only do they provide startups
    with new channels for funding, but they also offer more inclusivity. Before these
    models, average investors could not buy stock until the Initial Public Offering,
    long after the qualified investors had already taken the lion’s share of opportunities.

    borders each year.^([1](#fn_1)) Intermediaries collect about $2.2 trillion in
    revenue to facilitate these transactions. Money may move around the world in several
    ways using a variety of services, but we’ll focus on a simplified version of the
    process. In today’s global financial systems, each country has its own national
    payment system and uses its own sovereign currency.^([2](#fn_2)) A bank must be
    licensed to use its country’s national payment system. International transactions
    often rely on the cooperation between banks in different countries, creating a
    messy web of correspondent bank relationships (see [Figure 5.1](#f_5_1) for a
    simplified depiction).^([3](#fn_3)) With a cross-border payment in today’s global
    financial system, the sending and receiving parties’ financial institutions, national
    payment systems, and corresponding banks process the transaction. Parties to an
    exchange have no access to the status of the transaction or even which institution
    controls a transaction as it works its way through the system. Fees accumulate
    with each step in the process. Trading partners do not always know the fees in
    advance, which can become quite substantial. Sending remittances costs an average
    of 6.8 percent of the amount sent and takes several business days to settle.^([4](#fn_4)),^([5](#fn_5))
    The costs for sending money to sub-Saharan Africa are even higher, with an average
    cost of nine percent for remittances.^([6](#fn_6)) Global payments usually involve
    exchanging currencies.

    will pay back more money than the original amount in the form of interest payments.
    The lending market is racking up unprecedented levels of global debt. According
    to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)—an organization comprising 190 countries—global
    debt rose to $226 trillion in 2020.^([10](#fn_10)) This includes borrowing by
    governments (public debt), intuitions, and consumers. Over the past fifty years,
    the world increasingly borrows more money than it generates in value, as measured
    by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (see [Figure 5.3](#f_5_3)). While the entire global
    financial system can absorb some losses, if a large proportion of borrowers default,
    we end up with collapses like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

    这包括政府借款（公共债务）、机构借款和消费者借款。过去五十年里，世界上的借款金额超过了其通过国内生产总值（GDP）衡量的价值增长。（参见[图5.3](#f_5_3)）尽管整个全球金融系统可以承受一些损失，但如果大部分借款人违约，我们最终会遭遇像2008年全球金融危机那样的崩溃。
- en: The loaning of money involves considerable counter-party risks. How can the
    lender be confident that the borrower will pay them back as agreed? Loans typically
    require collateral, meaning that the borrower has to stake something of value
    to give the lender if the borrower defaults. Enter the banks and other financial
    institutions to mitigate counter-party risks. Additionally, governments and regulators
    provide deposit insurance and enforce rules to reduce the risks of losses to depositors
    and to reduce the amount of debt an individual can incur based on their ability
    to pay back a loan.

- en: 'Here’s an overview of lending and borrowing using a bank: Lenders deposit money
    in a bank in return for earning interest, but the interest rates they earn on
    deposits are paltry. In February of 2022, the US national bank average for interest
    payments on savings accounts was only .06 percent. If you deposit $1,000 in a
    savings account, after a year, you will only earn 60 cents in interest!^([i](#rfn_i))
    So why do it? Some depositors like to keep cash on hand in case of emergencies,
    and a bank is a relatively safe bet. In the US, banks must be insured from the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to get a bank charter. (Although
    in the last chapter, we learned that SPDI banks argue that they should not be
    required to obtain FDIC insurance since they hold all deposits in reserve.) The
    FDIC insures an account holder up to $250,000 per insured bank.'

    那为什么还要这么做呢？一些存款人喜欢在手头保留现金以备不时之需，而银行是一个相对安全的选择。在美国，为了获得银行特许证，银行必须得到联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）的保险。
    (尽管在上一个章节中，我们了解到SPDI银行认为他们不应该被要求获得FDIC保险，因为他们将所有存款都保留在储备中。) FDIC为每个受保银行的所有账户持有人提供高达25万美元的保险。

- en: So, from a lender’s perspective, traditional banking services offers a relatively
    safe place to deposit money, but the financial returns are small. Their deposits
    are used to loan money to borrowers. Borrowers, on the other hand, pay relatively
    high interest rates to the bank. On February 27, 2022, the average fixed-mortgage
    rate was 4.25 percent. If a borrower borrows $1,000 for one year, the borrower
    will pay the bank $23.17 in interest. The difference between what the bank pays
    to depositors and receives from borrowers is called the spread. In our little
    scenario of depositing and borrowing $1,000, the spread is huge; it’s 70 times
    greater for borrowers than for depositors!

  zh: 所以，从贷款者的角度来看，传统银行服务提供了一个相对安全的地方来存放资金，但金融回报很小。他们的存款被用来向借款人放贷。另一方面，借款人向银行支付相对较高的利率。2022年2月27日，平均固定抵押贷款利率为4.25%。如果借款人借1000美元一年，借款人将向银行支付23.17美元的利息。银行向存款者支付的金额与从借款人那里收到的金额之间的差异称为利差。在我们这个存贷款1000美元的小场景中，利差巨大；对于借款人来说，它是存款者的70倍！
- en: Banks loan out more money to borrowers than they retain in deposits. It’s called
    fractional reserve banking and it is allowed because it helps to expand the economy.
    But there are risks! If a large portion of depositors suddenly demand their money
    back in cash, the bank could go bankrupt. It’s called a run on the bank, and the
    history of banking is littered with them. Therefore US banks need FDIC insurance
    to help protect depositors. Additionally, borrowers may default on their loans,
    which happened in droves during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Recall the quote
    from Satoshi Nakamoto, *“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer
    it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely

    three specific applications. Ripple and Stellar each built global payments and
    currency exchange applications with transparent order books, rapid settlement
    times and low transaction costs. Stellar added automatic market makers (AMM) functionality
    in 2021\. Ripple and Stellar also solve the problem of exchanging currencies when
    no direct markets exist (like our Thai baht to Brazilian real example) by using
    their native digital assets as bridge currencies. In Ripple, for example, the
    sender’s fiat currency can be exchanged for Ripple’s XRP and the receiver of the
    XRP can convert it to a different fiat currency from the sender’s fiat currency.
    Ripple and Stellar are very similar applications; both applications were co-founded
    by Jed McCaleb and have similar protocols. They have different target markets.
    Ripple primarily targets institutional customers; Stellar aims to expand access
    to financial services for those excluded today. Aave is a decentralized application
    for lending and borrowing, with lower transaction fees, faster settlement times,
    and smaller spreads than traditional financial institutions. This application
    allows people to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies with no financial intermediaries.

    McCaleb）共同创立，并且有类似的协议。他们的目标市场不同。瑞波主要针对机构客户；恒星旨在扩大今天被排除在外的金融服务的接入。Aave是一个去中心化的借贷应用，其交易费用更低、结算时间更快、利差更小，比传统金融机构更具优势。这个应用允许人们在没有任何金融中介的情况下，借贷加密货币。

    Sally could send money to someone she trusts, say John; John then sends the money

    a new distributed ledger protocol, called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP).^([42](#fn_42))

    be sent to anyone (permissionless), but also features trust lines where transactions

    pay gateways, as each may establish fees in the form of XRP for using the gateway.
    If trading partners transact directly without using gateways, senders of ripple
    transactions pay a small amount of ripples so that attackers won’t spam the system
    with millions of transactions, as the attackers would run out of XRP.^([44](#fn_44))
    Designed to be a scarce asset, the XRP money supply is exactly 100 billion ripples
    and was issued at the launch of the protocol, rather than released through the
    process of mining as Bitcoin does.^([45](#fn_45)) Ripple is a deflationary currency—once

    V1、Aave V2、AMM市场、Aave市场Polygon和Aave市场Avalanche。这一天这些五个市场的总流动性池，即总存款，达到了183亿美元([表5.3](#t_5_3))。

- en: Aave V1 and Aave V2 are the first and second versions of Aave; both versions
    run on Ethereum, and therefore incur the relatively high transaction fees of Ethereum.
    Aave V1 is being slowly phased out, and it is reflected in its lower-valued liquidity
    pools compared to AaveV2\. On this day in February 2022, V1’s total market size
    was just $128 million, while V2’s total market size was about $11 billion. The
    AMM Market was launched in March 2021\. It is an automatic market maker (AMM)
    linked to Uniswap, which also runs on Ethereum. The AMM Market allows users who
    deposit tokens in Uniswap to use those tokens as collateral in the Aave market.
    It’s primarily used for flash loans.^([ii](#rfn_ii)) Its market value was $12
    million on this day. To lower transaction fees, users can use the market that
    runs on Polygon, a layer 2 solution that rides atop of Ethereum. Aave Market Polygon
    had $1.7 billion in liquidity on this day. Aave was launched on Avalanche, another
    blockchain network, in October of 2021\. Within a few hours of launch, the lending
    pool exceeded $1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies!^([116](#fn_116)) A few months
    later, the Aave Market Avalanche had a liquidity pool worth nearly $6 billion.

- en: 'Focusing on the Aave V2 market, [Figure 5.11](#f_5_11) shows the six largest
    liquidity pools on February 28, 2022 (there are 32 pools in all). Ethereum’s liquidity
    pool shows $4.08 billion worth of ETH deposits and $172 million worth of ETH out
    on loans to borrowers. Three rates are quoted: the annual percentage yield (APY)
    earned for depositing ETH into the liquidity pool and two APY rates for borrowing
    ETH. Users may borrow at a variable rate or stable rate. Variable rates fluctuate
    with market factors; the stable rate is constant for the duration of the loan.
    Stable rates are typically higher than variable rates, but some borrowers prefer
    to definitively know their expenses. Some of the rates also have additional incentives
    to use the Aave Market Polygon, showing that depositors will get a bonus in Polygon’s
    native digital currency, MATIC, if they use the Polygon market instead of the
    Aave V2 market. As with traditional financial services, there is a spread between
    interest earned and interest paid, but the spreads are much narrower in DeFi.'

    V2市场，存款者将获得Polygon的原生数字货币MATIC的奖励。与传统金融服务一样，利息收入和利息支付之间存在利差，但在DeFi中，利差要窄得多。

    are pegged 1:1 to the deposited crypto asset. aTokens are created, i.e., ‘minted’,

    they are withdrawn. For example, if a person deposits five bitcoins to an Aave
    liquidity pool, the Aave dApp mints 5 aBitcoins. The person’s digital wallet will
    show the balance in aBitcoins. The wallet will accrue interest in aBitcoins. When

    aBitcoins and sends bitcoins back to the person’s wallet.

    By taking a deep dive into each, we can appreciate the importance of governance
    discussed in [Chapter 2](chapter02.xhtml) and how to map blockchains to the Blockchain
    Application Framework in [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml). On governance, Ripple is
    the most centrally controlled due to Ripple Labs’ large XRP holdings, but anyone
    can propose amendments. Stellar’s improvements are largely influenced by the SDF,
    but anyone may make proposals. Aave is an example of on-chain governance, with
    the use of governance tokens to make decisions about the Aave networks—it’s exciting
    to think about this new on-chain governance model for organizing human activity.
    On the Blockchain Application Framework, Ripple, Stellar, and Aave have made their
    code bases available for all to see. This transparency gives the public more confidence
    that the applications function as claimed.

    services, but we highlight its bond issuance and settlement on a public blockchain
    in this chapter. we.trade was founded by a consortium of banks that pooled money
    to develop a blockchain platform to automate trade finance services, primarily
    for small-to-mid-sized customers, and then a joint venture to launch the service
    into production in 2018\. KoreConX was founded by Oscar Jofre and Jason Futko

- en: Let’s first understand the pain points in trade financing before we.trade. Trade
    finance is a process which helps to reduce counter-party risks for the financing
    of trade between a buyer and a seller, often internationally. Exporters/sellers
    need to mitigate payment risks and want to get paid as early as possible by importers/purchasers.
    Importers/purchasers want to make sure goods were shipped and often want extended
    credit on their payment. Trusted third parties like banks step in to reduce the
    financial risks of exporters and importers. The exporter’s bank may loan money
    to the exporter based on the contract. If exporters want to mitigate their risks
    further, they may even sell their receivables at a discount. The importer’s bank
    may provide a letter of credit that will ensure the exporter of getting paid upon
    proof that the goods were shipped, such as a bill of lading. Setting up open accounts
    and lines of credit typically take seven days (see [Figure 6.4](#f_6_4)). Moreover,
    many banks struggle with establishing trade finance services, particularly to
    scale. According to Roberto Mancone, a co-founder and first COO of we.trade, *“The
    traditional trade finance model run by banks had not evolved for decades. Both
    banks and companies were constrained. Banks were not able to scale their platform
    to make it available to all clients.”^([34](#fn_34))*

  zh: 在讨论贸易融资的痛点之前，我们先来了解一下贸易融资的过程。贸易融资是一种帮助减少买方和卖方之间贸易融资的对手方风险的过程，这种情况经常发生在国际贸易中。出口商/卖家需要减轻支付风险，并希望尽可能早地从进口商/买家那里获得付款。进口商/买家希望确保货物已经发出，并且通常希望延长他们的付款信用期。像银行这样的可信第三方介入，以减少出口商和进口商的财务风险。出口商的银行可能会根据合同向出口商提供贷款。如果出口商想要进一步减轻他们的风险，他们甚至可能会以折扣价出售他们的应收账款。进口商的银行可能会提供信用证，以确保在提供货物已经发出的证明（如提单）的情况下，出口商能够收到付款。开设公开账户和信贷额度通常需要七天（见[图6.4](#f_6_4)）。此外，许多银行在建立贸易融资服务方面存在困难，尤其是在扩大规模方面。根据we.trade的联合创始人兼第一任COO罗伯托·曼科内（Roberto
    Mancone）的说法，“由银行运营的传统贸易融资模型数十年来没有发生变化。银行和公司都受到了限制。银行无法扩大其平台规模，使其对所有客户可用。”^([34](#fn_34))*

    2017, came together to reduce the pain points common to many banks. Initially,
    the seven banks formed a consortium, with each bank putting in about $200,000,
    an amount below capital investment levels that do not require layers of approvals.
    The banks did not merely want to do a POC—they were committed to developing a
    live platform in 12 months. To move things forward, they did not require unanimous
    decisions, but rather required a 51 percent or 67 percent majority depending on
    the complexity of the decision. To prevent anti-trust violations, the banks were
    prohibited from discussing go-to-market strategies. While the consortium was focused
    on the technical implementation, the partners also were working in parallel to
    develop a legal entity. The joint venture came in February of 2018, when all the
    consortium’s intellectual property was transferred to it. The banks, which had
    now grown to 12 members, became shareholders in the JV, but each bank still needs
    a license to operate the software. Banks could also license the software without
    becoming investors. Roberto Mancone became the COO of the JV. He said, *“We needed

    80,000 public companies have easy access to global investors who can use their
    cell phones to issue trades in seconds. In contrast, the 450 million private companies
    have very limited access to investors. Small, privately-owned companies rely on
    local dealers and brokers when trying to raise capital. Each deal is unique, and
    typically takes weeks for a private company to find a counterparty, negotiate
    an agreement, and gain approvals from their boards. Moreover, there is little
    automation; most private companies rely on local spreadsheets. The idea behind
    KoreConX is a platform *“to give small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) a single
    location to manage all of their corporate records, funding, investors and investment
    brokers so they could efficiently take advantage of innovative new capital-raising
    opportunities.”^([53](#fn_53))* Kiran Garimella, Chief Scientist and CTO for KoreConX,
    describes the platform as an *“infrastructure of trust that welcomes all regulated
    entities”*.^([54](#fn_54)) Besides running the platform, KoreConX is a transfer
    agent that also operates on the platform, but more than 600 KorePartners that
    include broker-dealers, securities lawyers, secondary market operators, and other
    service providers provide the bulk of the business operations on the platform.
    For example, providers ensure Know Your Customer (KYC), such as certifications

    to process 10 billion transactions per year (about 318 transactions per second).

  zh: KoreConX的KoreChain是基于Hyperledger Fabric构建的，这是一个私有的权限型区块链（关于Fabric的更多信息，请参见[第4章](chapter04.xhtml)）。KoreConX选择区块链，因为它是一个安全的多方交易处理解决方案，具有防篡改和始终可用的特点。它选择了一个***私有的***区块链解决方案，因为金融交易需要保密，对谁有权访问数据有严格的规定。此外，大多数国家要求投资数据存储在本国司法管辖区内，这只能通过私有的区块链来保证。KoreConX选择Fabric，因为它是截至2018年评估时最成熟的代码库。到2020年第一季度，KoreConX的区块链（KoreChain）在23个国家部署，部署在五个不同的云平台（IBM、AWS、Azure、Google、Digital
    Ocean）上，具备每年处理100亿笔交易的能力（大约每秒318笔交易）。
- en: The platform has been proven to be resilient. Garimella said, *“Blockchains
    by nature are resilient because they are distributed. When a node is unavailable
    for whatever reason and then reconnected to the network, the node automatically
    re-syncs with the rest of the network. Node failures, therefore, don’t affect
    the network as long as the minimum number of nodes for forming consensus are available.
    In our tests, when we brought down major areas of our global network and reconnected
    them, they ‘heal’ automatically. The process is totally hands-off.”*

  zh: 该平台已被证明具有弹性。Garimella说，“区块链本身具有弹性，因为它们是分布式的。当由于某种原因节点不可用，然后重新连接到网络时，节点会自动与网络中的其他节点同步。只要能够形成共识的最少节点数量可用，节点失败就不会影响网络。在我们的测试中，当我们下线我们全球网络的主要部分并重新连接它们时，它们会自动‘愈合’。整个过程完全是自动的。”

- en: KoreChain aims to provide value for all the participants in the ecosystem. For
    the C-suite of private companies, the KoreConX offers guaranteed compliance, better
    issuance (multi-jurisdiction) and liquidity. For the C-suite of private equity
    investors, it offers access to global market opportunities, safety, protection,
    and due diligence. For broker-dealers, it improves deal flow, compliance, and
    syndication. For securities attorneys, it is about efficient compliance, more
    clients and business, managing regulatory and contract risks. For providers (transfer
    agents, KYC/AML, custodians), the main advantage is scalability.

    systems, when transactions on this platform are made efficient for one party,
    the benefits quickly spread to, and are shared by all the other parties involved
    in the transaction. Process efficiencies and reduced costs are the most obvious
    benefits, but the value goes beyond to improved user experience and stronger,
    sustained long-term relationships, and trust.”* [Table 6.2](#t_6_2) highlights

- en: Santander, we.trade, and KoreConX represent non-blockchain native organizations
    exploring blockchain applications to solve problems in today’s financial systems.
    They are important examples of live production systems used by enterprises. Santander’s
    bond issuance on a public blockchain is particularly forward-thinking. Public
    blockchains have the advantage of open networks and low investments in IT infrastructure.
    A 2022 study by HfS research on 1200 enterprise use cases found that enterprises
    were moving to public blockchains with greater frequency, particularly due to
    the advent of zero-knowledge proofs (discussed in [Chapter 10](chapter10.xhtml))
    that allow private transactions on public networks.^([55](#fn_55)) In the next
    chapter, we’ll explore blockchain applications in supply chains.

    在下一章中，我们将探讨区块链在供应链中的应用。

    to help supply chain partners—and often times end consumers—prove the authenticity
    and provenance of physical assets during their entire journeys from source to
    final destination. The specific solutions examined are IBM Food Trust to trace
    food from farm-to-fork and bait-to-plate; BeefChain to track beef and other meats;
    supply chain platforms by VeChain, Everledger, and EY OpsChain Traceability, to
    track food, diamonds, fine wines, fine beers, luxury items, and other high-valued
    goods; and DL Freight to process freight invoicing and payments. Lastly, we study
    VeriTX, which creates entirely new models for supply chains, such as pivoting
    from centralized to decentralized parts manufacturing by using 3D printing, AI
    and blockchains. The benefits from these solutions include more efficient supply
    changes, demonstration of ethical sourcing, fewer counterfeit products, fewer
    lost products, fewer disputes among trading partners, less waste, and better mission
    readiness rates.'

    services. Global financial markets are inherently ***digital***. Moving money
    around the world is about changing entries in ***digital*** ledgers. Given that
    financial assets are digital by nature, we did not have to worry about the things
    we will worry about in this chapter. Global supply chains are inherently about
    moving ***physical*** goods around the world and trying to keep track of the location,
    custodianship (i.e., the organization currently in charge of the goods), condition,
    and authenticity of the goods. Increasingly, global supply chains are also expected
    to capture data to make sure goods were produced with fair labor practices and
    with environmentally sustainable practices.

    goods. While manufacturers, exporters, couriers, freight forwarders, customs,
    inspectors, exporters, shippers, and importers are moving physical goods, they
    are also creating data about those movements with bills of lading; certifications;
    consignments; customs forms; inspections data; insurance forms; invoices; lines
    of credit; purchase orders; shipping manifestos; and receiving documents (see
    [Figure 7.1](#f_7_1)). [Figure 7.1](#f_7_1) only shows the movement of goods across
    oceans, but there are complex domestic supply chains that connect to exports/imports.
    The exporting country has supply chains from raw material suppliers, farms, ranches,
    fisheries, manufacturers, warehousers, distributors, and transporters to the exporting
    port; the importing country has supply chains from the importing port to distributors,
    warehousers, transporters, wholesalers and retail stores. There’s also the ‘last
    mile’ to include, such as home delivery services. As a consequence of so many
    players generating so much data, assets get lost or stolen, shipping containers
    get delayed in ports because of missing paperwork, inconsistent records across
    trading partners trigger disputes and counterfeit products slip through supply
    chains, to highlight some of the challenges.

    The food supply chain has been particularly challenging to coordinate because
    of its scale and perishability. The global food and grocery retail markets are
    a $12 trillion market.^([1](#fn_1)) While much of the world’s food supply is safe,
    there is significant room for improvement. The World Health Organization reports
    that 600 million people get food poisoning and 420,000 die each year from consuming
    contaminated foods.^([2](#fn_2)) Besides food contamination, the world food supply
    suffers significant amounts of food waste, food mislabeling, and food fraud, such
    as claiming horse meat as lamb and claiming non-organically grown vegetables as
    organic.^([3](#fn_3)) Human rights and environmental problems, such as slave labor
    and unauthorized use of pesticides, remain grave concerns. For example, the International
    Labor Organization estimates that 3.5 million people are forced to work in agriculture,
    fishing, and forestry.^([4](#fn_4)) Each country has its share of food safety
    challenges, but next we focus on the US as the largest food producer.
  id: totrans-478
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The US food industry is a $6 trillion business.^([5](#fn_5)) The US Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 48 million Americans get
    sick from food; 128,000 Americans are hospitalized; and 3,000 die of food-borne
    diseases each year.^([6](#fn_6)) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had 69
    active food recalls from January 1 to March 22 in 2022, primarily for contaminated
    produce, dairy, and meat products.^([7](#fn_7)) Other recalls were prompted by
    mislabeling, some by circumventing import inspections, some by misbranding, and
    some because of undeclared allergens.^([8](#fn_8)) Food waste is also a large
    problem; $162 billion of food is wasted every year in the US, largely due to the
    inability to estimate demand and to track supplies.^([9](#fn_9))

    chain creating and storing their own data in their own centralized systems. They
    share the data with the next partner in the supply chain. It’s known as ‘one step
    up, one step back’ visibility. When a retailer must respond to a food recall,
    for example, it can take days or even weeks to trace the produce on its shelves
    to the farmers who grew it. Blockchain-enabled supply chains address many of the
    data challenges.

    when public blockchains like Ethereum were barely a year old—like IBM Food Trust
    and Everledger—so a public blockchain was not a viable option. These first blockchain
    solutions are deployed on private-permissioned networks. Additionally, ecosystem
    partners selected private-permissioned blockchains because they were concerned
    that competitors could learn valuable information about their operations if they
    adopted a public blockchain solution. DL Freight chose a private-permissioned
    blockchain to ensure that transactions are confidential and only shared with authorized
    parties.

    conducting food traceability pilot programs for mangos and pork back in 2016\.
    The solution, based on HyperLedger Fabric, reduced traceability for mangos from
    seven days to under three seconds.^([12](#fn_12)) In 2017, other supply chain
    partners joined the network, including Dole, McCormack, McLane, Driscoll’s, Unilever,
    Golden State Foods, Nestle, and Kroger. By 2022, 520 members had joined.

    IBM Food Trust platform relies on ‘trust anchors’ for validation using a Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism (see [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml)).
    Trust anchors receive a full copy of the encrypted ledger but can only view the
    hashes of the transaction if data owners grant access. Trust anchors are responsible

    solution that aims to restore equity in the US beef supply chain. The US beef
    supply chain includes ranchers who breed and raise cattle, sales barns where ranchers
    sell cattle, feedlots where cattle are fattened, and meat processors who process
    and package beef for sale to wholesalers and retailers. In the US, the beef supply
    chain is shaped like an hourglass, with many ranchers at the top, few feedlots
    and meat processors in the middle and many wholesalers/retailers at the bottom.
    In the State of Wyoming, 11,400 ranches are mostly small, family-owned ranches.^([24](#fn_24))
    Only four meat processors control 85 percent of the US market.^([25](#fn_25))
    On the one hand, consolidation of meat processing has lowered processing costs.
    On the other hand, consolidation has made supply chains vulnerable, as evidenced
    by the shortages caused by meat processing plant shutdowns due to COVID-19 staffing
    shortages and ransomware attacks.^([26](#fn_26))
  id: totrans-532

- en: As far as equity in this supply chain, the consolidated feedlots and meat processors
    hold the power to set prices. The prices ranchers receive for cattle have decreased
    by 35 percent while retail prices have increased by eight percent since 2015.^([27](#fn_27))
    Moreover, ranchers often do not share in the value of raising higher quality meat.
    When ranchers sell cattle, the main determinant of price is the weight of the
    cattle unless the rancher can prove how the cattle were raised via a US Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) Process Verified Program (PVP). Without PVP certification
    that can prove cattle were raised on grass, in open fields, and without antibiotics
    or hormones, the quality of the meat is not considered until after the ranchers
    have already sold them. The USDA quality grading happens at the processing plant
    based on the marbling of the meat carcass. The meat processors can charge higher
    prices to wholesalers/retailers for USDA prime, choice, and select cuts.

    individuals with knowledge of beef supply chains and blockchain technology in
    2018\. American Certified Brands, founded by Steve Lupien and others, is the holding
    company. BeefChain’s mission is to restore equity in the beef supply chain by
    verifying that cattle were grass fed, free range, and fairly treated so that ranchers
    can charge more money for their cattle.^([28](#fn_28)) The company uses RFID tags
    and blockchain technology to prove the care and provenance of cattle.

- en: To trace cattle on a blockchain, BeefChain first had to recruit ranchers to
    create unique identifiers for each animal. Ranchers usually sell calves when they
    are one to two years old, so early tagging was a critical step in preparation
    for achieving traceability later. Ranchers need to tag calves’ ears with machine
    readable tags that capture time-stamped information about the animal’s birth and
    parentage. Each RFID tag costs about $5.00\. To help make ranchers aware of the
    opportunity, Ogden Driskill—a well-known Wyoming rancher and politician—announced
    that he had tagged 323 calves from his ranch in 2018\. Soon after, two other ranchers
    tagged their herds.^([29](#fn_29))

    (POC). BeefChain, the University of Wyoming and Avery Dennison—an RFID company—completed
    a POC in 2018 that traced beef raised on Murraymere Farms in Wyoming to an upscale
    restaurant in Taiwan. The solution used RFID tags and labels to track the movement
    of beef from the farm, processing plant, export, and import to the restaurant.^([31](#fn_31))
    The POC showed that the solution could technically work.

    2019, BeefChain received the first USDA approval as a Process Verified Program
    (PVP) for a blockchain company. This allows BeefChain to audit feedlots and ranches
    to verify the source and age of animals; whether cattle were treated with hormones;
    or whether natural raising practices on grass and without antibiotics or hormones
    were followed.^([32](#fn_32)) BeefChain auditors now had the authorization to
    help more ranchers command higher prices. By 2020, Tyler Lindholm, one of BeefChain’s
    co-founders, said that ranchers who adopted the solution see a return on investment
    because ranchers are commanding higher prices through the PVP certification. He
    said, *“Most of the ranchers know we use blockchain technology, but the main thing
    they care about is that they received a return on their invest of anywhere between
    5 to 50 cents per pound—that’s about an extra $30,000 per year per rancher.”^([33](#fn_33))*
    BeefChain charges ranchers a fee per head of cattle tracked in exchange for access
    to the technology and PVP certification. The cost is more than offset by the higher
    prices they now receive.

    rancher’s financing options. Ranchers only get paid once a year when they sell
    the herd. Ranchers typically take out loans to finance their operations. What
    if ranchers sold their tokens to foster new investment models, such as fractional
    ownership of a cow, bull or even an entire herd? Breeding bulls, for example,
    can be worth $1 million, and an NFT can easily track hundreds of smaller-sized
    investors. Tokenization can also improve regulatory compliance. Instead of a blanket
    inspection to certify an entire herd for sale, NFTs tie each animal in the herd
    to the inspection certification and maintain that record of passing inspection
    even as it gets separated from the herd as it moves through the supply chain.
    Moreover, animal inspections across state lines could be automated by reading
    the RFID tag and pulling the relevant inspection data from the system.

    employees. EY’s blockchain strategy has been unique among enterprise leaders for
    its early commitment to the use of public blockchains for enterprise transactions.
    EY believes that private-permissioned blockchains are not the end-game due to
    vendor lock-in, lack of scalability, and lack of interoperability. EY sees the
    benefits of public blockchains, such as Ethereum, as (a) an ability to participate
    without investing in significant technology and hosting a node; (b) all relevant
    information remains on the public blockchain and available to all participants,
    even if the project fails or various individuals leave the project; and (c) an
    increased ability to leverage upcoming blockchain approaches and upgrades through
    community development so that the participants in the use-case specific network
    can focus on business rules, transactions, and governance and not the underlying
    development of a blockchain platform. To help enterprise adoption of public blockchains,
    EY has contributed to open-source code bases—most notably Nightfall and the Baseline
    Protocol—that use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to execute confidential transactions
    on public blockchains. (ZKPs are explained in [Chapter 10](chapter10.xhtml)).

    traceability. Its history began with WineChain. EY developed WineChain in 2018
    to authenticate wines and to restore trust in a marketplace plagued by fakes—counterfeit
    wines are a multi-billion-dollar business.^([47](#fn_47)) The solution is a hybrid
    with a public blockchain for verification of wine authenticity and a private blockchain
    for value transfer. For wine authenticity, each wine bottle is tokenized as an
    ERC-721 token and posted to Ethereum; the token is transformed to a QR code that
    is affixed to the wine bottle’s label. By 2020, EY had tokenized 11 million unique
    wine bottles with an ERC-721 token.^([48](#fn_48)) Customers can scan the code
    with their smartphones and get verification that the wine is authentic (see [Figure
    7.10](#f_7_10)). Consumers can learn about when and where grapes were harvested,
    bottling date, lot number, quality of sulphites, and other data. For value transfer,
    vineyards, wine producers, brokers, importers, wholesalers, distributors, and
    retailers rely on Quorum—a private network version of Ethereum—to exchange value
    and to track the bottles as they move through the supply chain.^([49](#fn_49))
    EY chose Quorum in anticipation of a pivot from private to public networks; building
    on Quorum with public blockchains in mind minimizes the recoding required to switch
    to Ethereum in the future.

    processing developed by Walmart Canada and DLT Labs. The case study begins in
    summer 2018 within the supply chain and logistics organization of Walmart Canada.
    Leaders wanted to address the problems with freight invoicing. While Walmart Canada
    has its own fleet of 2,000 trailers used for shipments to the stores, it also
    relies on 70 third-party freight carriers—some large-sized and some small-sized—to
    move over 500,000 loads per year.^([52](#fn_52)) A single freight invoice can
    have up to 200 data elements from various partners in the supply chain. Because
    each partner maintains its own systems of record, Walmart Canada’s information
    often conflicted with their partners’ information. Walmart Canada was frustrated
    with the time and resources needed to verify carriers’ variable charges (called
    accessorial charges) on invoices. Before DL Freight, Walmart Canada and its freight
    carriers disputed 70 percent of invoices. It took days, weeks and even months
    to settle them, resulting in administrative expenses rising to about 20 percent
    of transportation costs.^([53](#fn_53)) Freight carriers were not getting paid
    in a timely manner, and both sides were spending too much money on reconciliations.

    time. Walmart had to investigate all the unexpected accessorial charges that appeared
    on an invoice. As shown in [Figure 7.11](#f_7_11), the freight invoice process
    before the adoption of DL Freight required 11 steps. The value-adding steps are
    the ones that process data about the shipment, including confirming shipment details
    (Step 1), dispatching (Step 2), accepting or rejecting delivery (Step 3), issuing
    a correct invoice (Step 7), and paying the invoice (step 11). All the other steps
    involved reviewing data and reconciling any discrepancies within the freight carrier’s
    data.

    mission is to create trusted digital supply chain solutions based on three pillars:
    data integrity, process integrity and performance integrity. VeriTX is positioned
    at the convergence of Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0\. The net result of this convergence
    is a new modality of logistics, which Regenor calls digital, following the first
    three modalities of land, sea, and air. The core of the VeriTX solution portfolio

    in the US Air Force. Regenor was hired partly for his scenario-based planning
    skills to help Moog envision future business directions. While working at Moog,
    Regenor imagined a completely decentralized manufacturing process in which military
    and commercial customers could print parts where they need them, when they need
    them. The scenario went as follows:'

    deck of an aircraft carrier far out at sea. The only available aircraft has just
    been grounded with a failed critical part. There is no part inventory on the carrier.
    But we do have a 3-D printer and a stock of powder aboard. A technical data package
    is available for the part, and a replacement is quickly printed. You are the responsible
    person who needs to get this part quickly fitted to the aircraft and to sign the
    plane off as safe and ready to fly. How would you know if the newly printed additive

    had been tampered with by a cyber-terrorist? Or what if the instructions were
    counterfeit? Military and commercial users would need a way to guarantee that
    the part that came off the printer was authentic and that the part was ready for
    use. Furthermore, the newly printed part would need to be tracked over its entire
    lifetime, so it would need an embedded unique ID when it came off the printer.
    Military and commercial users would need a decentralized network with the highest
    security. Technically, Regenor and his team quickly realized that blockchain technologies
    might be the ideal technical solution: a decentralized blockchain application
    for decentralized additive manufacturing.^([58](#fn_58)) The size of the potential
    market is large. The US military is moving to digital supply chains, with an estimated

    to be a slow process. Professor Clayton Christensen’s Theory of Disruptive Innovation—discussed
    in [Chapter 11](chapter11.xhtml)—found that traditional businesses had a hard
    time disrupting themselves, and that spin-offs or investments in startups were
    better routes. Ultimately, Regenor decided to depart Moog in May of 2018 to accelerate
    development and to make the solution independent. He said, “*To be successful,
    we need VeriTX to be a neutral third-party platform.”* Regenor stayed on as a
    consultant with Moog as he launched VeriTX. While Regenor was named on the patents
    (along with other Moog employees), Moog owns the patents, so VeriTX licenses the
    patents from Moog. In late 2019, Moog became a strategic partner with VeriTX,
    as aligned with Christensen’s Theory.

    benefit is improved mission readiness rates and the commercial benefit is increased
    asset up time. The platform yields metadata and part data that can be used to
    inform predictive and prescriptive maintenance solutions. Today, most parts are
    fly-to-fail which is extremely inefficient and costly. Much efficiency can be
    gained, and costs reduced by enacting a prescriptive model.

    US Air Force, VeriTX is responsible for data integrity. We built a solution called
    Fortis to follow the data provenance for any part. Beyond that, we can also ascertain
    whether anything has been altered in the documents, which is critical for environments
    that need to assume ‘logistics under attack’.”* For the Fortis application, the
    solution demo was built on a private-permissioned version of Ethereum. VeriTx
    is working with a partner to potentially develop quantum key pairs for this solution
    in anticipation that advances in quantum computing will break the private-public

    Zealand, and while it was in flight, it radioed Air New Zealand maintenance facility
    in Auckland to report the part broken. Although the part is not critical, it would

    its supplier, Singapore-based ST Engineering (STE). STE pushed the order to Moog

    2020\. He rallied his global network of partners, and in just 12 days, the Pentagon
    awarded his company a contract for converting the abundant supply of sleep apnea
    machines into ventilators. The conversion requires additional parts that Rapid
    Medical Parts printed, and at a tenth of the cost of a new ventilator. After the
    contract was completed, the need to convert sleep apneas waned because industrial
    ventilator manufacturers were able to meet demand. In sharing his story with us,
    Regenor said, *“We all answer the call. Some run towards the cannons and others
    dig in. I have always run towards the cannons.”*

    approach for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials. SSI was introduced in
    [Chapter 1](chapter01.xhtml) as one of the major movements leading us to a decentralized
    Web 3.0\. In this chapter, we further explore the pain points with centralized
    approaches to credentials and how SSI solves them. We explore two case studies.
    The UK National Health Service (the NHS) developed a digital staff passport to
    verify health professionals’ qualifications and credentials to expedite staff
    transfers during COVID-19\. iDatafy developed SmartResume and a job market platform
    where individuals’ education and skills are verified by authorized issuers so
    that hiring companies find qualified talent.'

- en: Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a movement spearheaded by global communities
    to decentralize and automate the issuing, holding, and verifying of credentials
    made about subjects. It’s part of the imperative to evolve the World Wide Web
    from centralized control by institutions to decentralized control by individuals.
    SSI empower individuals to possess and control attestations made about them by
    authorized issuers—like a driver’s license or a university diploma—and to provide
    a more secure and private version of the Internet.
  id: totrans-727

- en: Let’s begin by first understanding the terminology. SSI is an unfortunate label,
    because we—like many academics—view identity as a psychological construct defined
    by self or as a social construct defined by one’s social group. From our perspective,
    governments and organizations do not provide individuals with ‘identities’. Instead,
    governments and organizations provide individuals with ‘credentials’, defined
    as attestations made about subjects by authorized issuers. SSI is all about automating
    the ecosystem for credentials that comprise issuers, holders, verifiers, and governing
    authorities. Let’s first look at holders since all readers hold credentials.
  id: totrans-728

- en: What are some of your credentials? To answer the question, look inside your
    physical wallet. Perhaps you have a driver’s license issued to you by your State
    or government; a student ID card issued by your university; a credit card issued
    by your bank; a membership card issued by a roadside assistance company; a health
    insurance card issued by your health insurance provider; an awards card issued
    by your favorite restaurant, or a COVID-19 vaccination card issued by your local
    health care provider. Your physical wallet holds physical proofs of your credentials,
    supplied to you by authorized issuers. You present these cards to verifiers as
    proof of your credentials, such as when you rent a car, borrow a book from your
    university library, pay your tuition, request a tow truck when your car breaks
    down, or prove your vaccination status when you travel abroad.

    in a digital SSI wallet. You’ll have them all in one convenient place. You’ll
    control who gets to see them—that’s where the term ‘self-sovereign’ comes in.
    These credentials are made about you, the credential holder, and you should have
    the right to decide with whom to share them. When a verifier requests to see them,
    you’ll decide what to offer as proof.
  id: totrans-730

- en: Student readers will relate to the classic SSI example. When bar tenders need
    proof that you are of legal drinking age, they ask to see your driver’s license.
    The bar tenders only need to see your date of birth, but they also see your name
    and address. With an SSI digital wallet, you will just share proof that you are
    over the legal drinking age, but you’ll keep your name and address hidden. This
    is called the SSI **data minimization** principle, which increases your **privacy**.
    Moreover, the bar tenders will trust your proof because the digital credentials
    will be machine verified. The bar tenders’ app will look up your State’s or issuing
    body’s public key on a public registry (most likely a blockchain registry) to
    ensure it—and only it—could have created your digital driver’s license. The issuer’s
    digital signature of your credential will be verified in seconds. Now you can
    understand why we think a better labeling of the SSI movement is ‘self-sovereign
    verifiable credentials’—but alas, SSI is the entrenched term, and we shall proceed
    with that nomenclature.

- en: Back to your physical wallet. Now let’s think about the online relationships
    you have with all those issuers. While your credentials exist in digital form
    somewhere, you have no control or direct access to them. You have online relationships
    with some of the issuers, such as your university, bank, insurance company, etc.,
    but they control the online relationship via accounts and passwords. Even if you
    decide to end a relationship by ‘deleting’ your account, all you have really accomplished
    is to deny yourself access to the account. The organizations control the accounts
    and decide their fate. So from your perspective as the holder of these credentials,
    you have very little agency. That is another problem SSI aims to solve for holders.
    Instead of accounts and passwords, you will have equal power in online relationships
    via peer-to-peer connections.

    no incentive to adopt the solution. SSI is also designed to solve their pain points.
    Institutions—including issuers and verifiers—also suffer high costs and high cybersecurity
    threats from managing accounts and passwords. Every password reset costs, on average,
    $70.^([1](#fn_1)) Centralized identity models are honey pots that lure cyber thieves.
    SSI’s peer-to-peer connections offers them a better way to manage their online
    relationships with us.

    are fraudulent. One of the most common frauds is claiming a university degree
    that was not earned. According to *The New York Times*, more than 50,000 doctorates
    are purchased from diploma mills every year—which exceeds the quantity legitimately
    awarded.^([2](#fn_2)) Can you imagine trusting a doctor who never went to medical
    school? Or a lawyer who never went to law school? Legitimate issuers and verifiers
    also suffer the consequences of fraudulent claims. Imagine you are the hospital
    that hired a fake doctor or the law firm that hired the fake lawyer. SSI makes
    sure that only authorized issuers can create the digital credentials.

    credentials. The ‘trust diamond’ visually represents the roles involved in an
    ecosystem for credentials. Let’s use university diplomas as examples. In [Figure
    8.1](#f_8_1), the **governing authority** set rules in the ecosystem by specifying
    the types of credentials allowed/required in the ecosystem and by specifying who
    is allowed to issue, hold, and verify credentials. For the University of Arkansas
    ecosystem, the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas is the governing
    authority. For the University of Wyoming ecosystem, the Board of Trustees of the
    University of Wyoming is the governing authority. Boards of Trustees have the
    final say on decisions about degree programs, minimum credit hours, staff qualifications,
    and designate which campuses are authorized **issuers** of which diplomas. Governing
    authorities publish their governance frameworks, typically on a website.^([i](#rfn_i))
    Students who meet all the requirements for diplomas are the **holders** of credentials.
    **Verifiers** are the individuals and institutions who need proof of diplomas,
    such as companies that want to hire them. Normally, a hiring company requires
    transcripts to come directly from the university. This process costs time and
    money, delaying the onboarding of new employees. SSI solves this problem as well.

    have been working on SSI and verifiable credentials for years. The Trust over
    IP (ToIP) Foundation in one prominent group. Founded in May of 2020 by 27 organizations
    (including the University of Arkansas’ Blockchain Center of Excellence), ToIP’s
    mission is to provide a robust, common standard and complete architecture for
    Internet-scale digital trust. ToIP is managed by the Linux Foundation as an open-source
    community. ToIP identified 11 principles of SSI, many of which we have discussed
    already—decentralization, user control and agency, verifiability & authenticity,
    privacy and minimal disclosure (see [Figure 8.2](#f_8_2)). The power of the SSI
    model is that anything that needs a credential is an SSI use case, including a
    person, a group, an organization, an animal, a physical thing, a digital thing,
    or a logical thing. That is SSI’s first principle, the principle of representation.
    So the SSI model is not just about people, although our two use cases do focus
    on humans as holders.

    many other organizations can gain value as well.

    platform is more than just a certified digital resume, it is a job acquisition
    platform that matches qualified job seekers with hiring organizations. While this
    case study does not use peer-to-peer connections or a decentralized PKI, it still
    meets many of the aspirations of SSI including verifiable credentials secured
    by blockchain technology, user control over who sees their credentials, minimal
    data exposure, voluntary participation, and data privacy. This case study is fascinating
    because of the size of the ecosystem. Whereas the NHS solution was adopted within
    one ecosystem, namely the NHS system of hospitals, SmartResume is bringing hundreds
    of issuers and verifiers to the platform. Building this vast ecosystem consumed
    most of iDatafy’s efforts, which will be difficult for competitors to replicate.

    solve the problem of processing staff transfers. More than 1,200 NHS hospitals
    employ more than 1.1 million people. Every time staff members move from one hospital
    to another hospital, all their credentials must be re-verified because the NHS
    hospital systems operate independently and manage their own human resources (HR).
    Staff must fill in multiple forms to prove their identity, credentials, and prior
    employment, and nearly half are required to travel to complete the onboarding
    process in person. Moreover, staff often retake training unnecessarily because
    they cannot prove their existing credentials.^([3](#fn_3))

    during training. More than 100,000 person-days are spent each year verifying junior

    avoiding vendor lock-in. For example, the NHS sought to avoid requiring staff
    to buy a specific phone or to rely exclusively on one vendor’s digital wallet.

    credentials for a doctor to work in its hospitals, such as a nationally recognized

    registration license, specific medical certifications (e.g., advanced life support,
    infectious disease), a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal-background
    check, and prior employment credentials. The doctors (and other healthcare professionals)
    are the **holders** of the credentials. Hospitals, GMC, the Post Office, and DBS
    serve as **issuers** of credentials, but the hospitals become **verifiers** when
    a healthcare professional begins work at their facility. Again, each hospital

    public blockchain-enabled registry. Its primary use is to serve as a decentralized
    public key infrastructure (PKI). Before SSI, issuers and verifiers rely on trusted-third
    parties called certificate authorities (CAs) to certify digital signatures. As
    we learned in [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml), digital signatures use a public key
    to verify that only the sender with possession of the private key could have sent
    the message. PKI is also used to ensure that users are connecting to the right
    website. CAs store organizations’ public keys on their centralized registries.
    Just as most holders do not like that their accounts and passwords are controlled
    by organizations, most issuers and verifiers do not like that certificate authorities
    control their public keys. SSI allows issuers and verifiers to control their own
    public keys, managed by a decentralized PKI.^([9](#fn_9))

    of a verifiable credential, the hospital’s app uses the NHS England data schema
    to format the credential and signs the digital credential with the hospital’s
    private key. When a hospital is in the role of a ***verifier*** of a credential,
    its app looks up the public key on the Sovrin Network to make sure the credential
    was signed by an authorized issuer. The private keys and credentials are stored

    providing backup and recovery of her credentials in case her phone is lost or
    damaged, and controlling who sees her credentials. Dr. Madden agrees to try the

    air drop cryptocurrency into someone’s digital wallet without the holder’s permission,
    holders are in complete control of who they connect with and what data goes in

    is glad Dr. Madden selected to onboard with the SSI app because her credentials
    can be verified in a few minutes (see [Figure 8.6](#f_8_6)). First, HR sends her
    a connect request. After Dr. Madden accepts the invitation on her phone, her SSI
    wallet now keeps track of two peer-to-peer relationships, one with her prior hospital
    in Oxford and one at her new place of employment in London. Next, HR asks Dr.
    Madden to prove her credentials. She opens her app and sends her verified credentials
    to HR. The verifier’s app doesn’t just accept Dr. Madden’s credentials, the app
    first pings the Sovrin Network to retrieve the public key from the hospital in
    Oxford to verify that it—and only it—could have created Dr. Madden’s credentials.
    Dr. Madden is now ready to start work.

    solution. Blockchain technology provides the ability for multiple parties to verify
    and trust that credentials are valid. But it would be a mistake to build the entire
    solution on a blockchain because it would be sluggish.”* From a user perspective,
    all the components operate seamlessly. People maneuver through the platform based
    on their roles, such as employers, educational institutions, workforce skill certifiers,
    and individuals.

- en: In this chapter, we discussed SSI as a model to decentralize and automate the
    issuing, holding, and verifying of credentials made about subjects. We presented
    two cases of early adopters. Both cases ensure that credentials are created by
    an authorized issuer, shared with holders, and proven to verifiers (verifiable
    credentials). Both solutions put the holders in control of with whom to share
    their credentials. Both solutions integrate distributed ledgers with traditional
    systems of record; the NHS integrated the digital staff passport with its HR systems
    and iDatafy integrated the blockchain application with more traditional technologies.
    The NHS case is closer to the full vision of SSI—peer-to-peer connections and
    decentralized PKI compared to the SmartResume platform.

    refugees set up by the World Food Program; digital health passes to create COVID-19
    status credentials for vaccinations, tests, and approved recovery; and the Canadian
    government’s issuance of business licenses.^([40](#fn_40)) But SSI is still a
    young technology. In 2021, Gartner positioned ‘SSI Decentralized Identity’ at
    the peak of inflated expectations on its famous Hype Cycle.^([41](#fn_41)) This
    seems like a correct judgement. After all, SSI is an ecosystem play. And ecosystems
    are hard and slow to build. The major lesson from the SmartResume case is that
    building the ecosystem consumed most of iDatafy’s time and resources, but this
    erects a barrier to entry because competitors will not easily be able to replicate
    it. Dave Wengel, founder and CEO, iDatafy said:'

    of the technology will be released and standards in provisional status today will
    be finalized. Gartner anticipates that SSI will pull out of the ‘trough of disillusionment’
    between 2023 and 2026\. But as we noted in [Chapter 4](chapter04.xhtml), industries
    and companies within industries adopt technologies at different rates.

    story, another entry is recorded on Ethereum and linked back to the original entry
    to form a chain of provenance. The solution registers about 3,000 news stories
    per day.

    the processing of new stories if the current cost of ether is too high. EY also
    kept transaction costs low by batching multiple news stories within a single transaction.
    Initially, EY was posting a batch of stories every 15 minutes, with an average
    cost per story of 6 cents. Then, EY was batching roughly 500-600 new stories every
    six hours, so the cost per transaction dropped to around 0.006 dollars per story.
    To reduce transaction costs even further, EY moved from Ethereum to Polygon in
    2021\. Polygon is a second layer of Ethereum, so it maintains public blockchain
    standards but with less costs of tokenization. The new contract is here:'

    journalists and checks everything that we publish. This first pass does not guarantee
    the complete accuracy of the contents; rather, it guarantees that this piece of
    news comes from ANSA, not from someone else.”*^([53](#fn_53)) The solution will

    EY’s blockchain HUB MED leader said, *“The solution will become more sophisticated
    in terms of functionality and components, such as fact-checking functions, semantic
    language analysis, and picture data protection.”* In the first generation of the
    solution, a story must be an identical copy of the original, as a change to even
    a single letter will signal that the source is not the original. In the next generation,
    the solution will provide a measure of overlap, similar to the plagiarism software
    familiar to many students. This way, publishers who repost a story can add their
    own commentary while still verifying the original news source.

    people are more susceptible to fake news than we are ourselves. In reality, most
    of us have believed a fake news story that we later discovered was verifiably
    false. While we are encouraged by the use of blockchains to authenticate news
    sources, no single solution will eradicate fake news. All parties in the ecosystem,
    including governments, journalists, publishers, social media platforms, and citizens,
    have roles to play. What ideas, technical and nontechnical, do you have for preventing
    the creation and dissemination of fake news?

- en: ^([52](#note_52)) A hash is an algorithm for transforming one input into a different
    output. Given a specific input, the identical output will always be reproduced.
    A good hash algorithm makes it practically impossible to determine the input value
    based on the output value, which is why hashes are called one-way functions. ANSAcheck
    uses the MD5 hashing algorithm, which always produces a 128-bit output.
