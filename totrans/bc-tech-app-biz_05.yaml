- en: Blockchain is proven to support businesses in traceability, data reliability,
    and data retrieval in all the steps of the supply chain, but still has limited
    use in the food sector. Through the EU-Horizon 2020-backed example of an Italian
    regional milk value chain, the chapter describes a real case toward the implementation
    of such technology in the food sector for the benefit of multiple stakeholders.
    The case sheds light on the gathering of information concerning the milk production
    through a network of advanced internet of things sensors, the output of which
    is employed both for data-driven decision-making and for information certification
    through blockchain. This trustable and certified information could be shared and
    employed by other stakeholders to get informed about the status of the production
    process and, in turn, to potentially deliver an enlarged set of details about
    the product, progressively up to the end consumers, with implications of technology
    adoption for food tech-firms and on related impacts on a circular economy.

- en: In recent years, supply chain processes have been the recipient of constant
    innovations (Wong et al., 2013), especially in the aspects of technology and traceability.
    Traceability, in particular, is a hot topic when talking about food, together
    with transparency and sustainability in the area of farming. Consumers are more
    and more interested (Olsen et al., 2018) in knowing where the food they are eating
    comes from, how it was produced, and what were the ethical principles behind the
    production chain. Governments and supranational organizations, such as the EU,
    are also promoting global efforts in that direction, with the aim of increasing
    food safety and protecting food quality (Badia-Melis et al., 2015). This important
    information presents a matter of reliability, when considering how consumers,
    suppliers, and legislators might trust that the details they are reading are correct.
    This is a relevant topic also when dealing with one of the most recent and discussed
    topics derived from the “Farm to Fork” strategy, connected to the labelling system
    of food products (Mazzù et al., 2021a).

    channels through which brands interact with customers (Ailawadi et al., 2017),
    several firms are still struggling with a plethora of issues related to communicating
    their transparency (Abeyratne et al., 2016). Specifically, a major challenge for
    firms has been to make their value chain more unambiguous and consistently deliver
    their brand promise to their external stakeholders (Boukis et al., 2020).

    et al., 2018). Through it, detailed information about products, sources of materials,
    and production processes, at every step of the manufacturing and supply chains,
    can be stored and then made available (Feng et al., 2020). Effects of the intrinsic
    features of this technology, such as immutability and transparency, can thus be
    transferred to the data and, thus, to the product (Galvez et al., 2018).

    chapter analyzes the case of an Italian dairy supply chain. In the scope of the
    Horizon 2020 European framework, as part of an effort to both increase transparency
    over the quality of products, and to increase the data-driven approach to decisions
    in farming. Maccarese S.pA., Ariete Fattoria Latte Sano S.p.A., Engineering Ingegneria
    Informatica S.p.A., and Ro Technology S.r.L. have deployed a blockchain-based
    project for the traceability of the entire milk production process and distribution
    chain. Metrics related to cows such as health state, certifications, medicines,
    or antibiotics, are progressively tracked through an immutable set of information
    stored in a dedicated system. Consumers and other actors along the supply chain
    could leverage this technology to obtain information about the product, all with
    a de-facto certification that the product that they have in their hands is authentic,
    healthy, and safe.

- en: Authenticity and trust are of paramount importance in the food sector (Bryła,
    2015; EU Science Hub, 2021; Reid et al., 2006). Being able to offer something
    of high quality is relevant, but it is even more relevant to be able to certify
    this quality, in order to drive the interest of the customer (Grunert, 2005; Verdú
    Jover et al., 2004). This must be related not only to the customer that finds
    the product on the shelf, but also when dealing with all the steps of the supply
    chain, downstream and upstream (Ali et al., 2017a; Ali et al., 2017b; Aung et
    al., 2014).

    reliability: consumer trust, supply chain transparency, product quality, logistic
    issues, environmental impact, personal consumer data, fraud, food safety, etc.
    (Ge et al., 2016; Trienekens et al., 2012). These issues go hand in hand with
    the innovations that are taking place in the sector. Supply chains are increasingly
    interconnected: Suppliers are tightly related to one another and to customers,
    internally and externally (Wong et al., 2013), and technology is becoming more
    and more present (Ayoub et al., 2017). Food supply chains, in particular, are
    increasingly adopting traceability features that put a spotlight on every detail
    (Bosona et al., 2013; Francisco et al., 2018), also mirroring the goal of many
    governmental programs such as the recent “Farm to Fork”, with a specific interest
    on sustainability (Grunert, 2011).'

    companies’ accountability and transparency (Hwang et al., 2017), as it can help
    provide information regarding the route of a product from raw materials to manufacturer
    to distributor to retailer, and finally, to the consumer (Apte et al., 2016; Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Transparency also reflects on interactions with brands, enabling
    firms to build consumer trust in the long term (Bengtsson et al., 2010), but also
    to improve cooperation between all the actors of the supply chain (Aste et al.,
    2017).

    among business partners and of asymmetries (Lucena et al., 2018), and fraud prevention
    (Ahmed et al., 2017). In the food sector, blockchain technology could also be
    used to supplement food traceability in new and existing supply chains. Currently,
    by contrast, either there is very limited traceability, or there are many siloed
    solutions, meaning traceability only exists internally for specific stakeholders
    within the supply chain (De Giovanni, 2021; Bumblauskas et al., 2020).

    While offline standards exist, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)
    (FDA, 2011) in the U.S. and the General Food Law in the EU (European Commission,
    2002), they are limited to their respective countries of origin. Moreover, they
    do not have interoperability in mind, and there is no standardized element that
    allows for a centralized, holistic, access to the archived data. (Dey et al.,
    2021). The centralization of existing information systems also creates trust problems,
    as it is easy by involved actors to tamper with the data.

    monitor their whole production process (Francisco et al., 2018). For example,
    Carrefour uses blockchain technology to trace the production of free-range chicken.
    Through the scanning of a special code on the package, consumers can obtain all
    the information about the chickens independent of the channel that consumers use
    to finalize their purchases. Barilla, working alongside IBM, is testing blockchain
    to monitor every step of basil production to guarantee the quality of the “Made
    in Italy” label (Prandelli et al., 2020). This information will be available to
    all consumers in all channels in which Barilla’s products are present. Another
    partnership exists between IBM and the Rio Mare brand of the Bolton Food group:
    Consumers can access information about the entirety of the production process

    In the case of end-customers, there are two main ways to grant simple access to
    the information stored: QR codes, and a link text (Dey et al., 2021; Mishra et
    al., 2020). A common way to communicate the availability of these elements to
    the end customer is by placing a QR code on the packaging of the product that,
    once scanned with a mobile device, opens up a website that allows exploration
    and retracing of the details stored on it (Bumblauskas et al., 2020; Kennedy et
    al., 2017). QR codes are traditionally perceived as more effective and easier
    to use. They can be applied to almost any object at minimal cost (Seino et al.,
    2004). The other alternative is a simple link placed on the packaging that redirects
    to a website in which the customer enters a unique ID related to the product,
    e.g., serial number or lot ID, and can subsequently retrieve the information.'

    might be skeptical about the technology (Davis, 1989) and thus transfer this skepticism
    and mistrust to the product itself. One of the ideal outputs derived from an investment
    in implementing a blockchain system in food is thus to reinforce the food quality
    perception and the trust in both the brand’s information and in the product. Highlighting
    and showcasing in a trustable and certified way elements that contribute to the
    perception of quality, such as ethical farming and agricultural practices, should
    improve the perception of the company in the eye of consumers, and thus contribute

- en: Blockchain leverages the concepts of transactions between nodes and blocks (Karafiloski
    et al., 2017; Nakamoto, 2008). In this implementation, transactions contain data
    and information about milk quality. Once these transactions reach a considerable
    quantity, they get merged into a block stored on the blockchain. When a block
    is created, miners proceed to validate the authenticity of all the transactions
    that exist inside the block. Similar to the Bitcoin blockchain validation system,
    miners authenticate transactions by the proof-of-work method (e.g., Efanov et
    al., 2018). Since blockchain is a distributed system, and every miner “owns” a
    part of the chain, information present on it is immutable and cannot be modified,
    thus ensuring that milk quality data is certain (Ayoade et al., 2018; Huang et
    al., 2018; Zhaofeng et al., 2020).

    milk production and transformation is processed by a cloud system and transformed
    into a standardized JSON-LD based data model. It is then processed by a middleware
    called a “transaction manager” that sits between the cloud storage designed by
    Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and the blockchain nodes owned and managed
    by Ro Technology S.rR.l., and stored on the actual chain, which for this project
    is an Ethereum Testnet called Rinkeby.

- en: A blockchain, such as Ethereum, can be divided in mainnets and testnets. A mainnet
    is the public, production blockchain, the kind usually known by the general public
    (Ethereum Documentation, 2021), where actual-value transactions occur on the distributed
    ledger. Transactions on these networks usually have a financial value attached
    to them. A testnet is instead a test blockchain that can be used by developers
    to test smart contracts in a production-like environment before deployment to
    the mainnet. With this aim, the Rinkeby Test Network, created in 2017, provides
    ether, the cryptocurrency part of the Ethereum protocol, to test applications,
    as well as in-depth statistics that can be used to track the amount of time a
    transaction takes to execute (Ranganthan et al., 2018). It is a proof-of-authority
    network running a specific consensus protocol. A proof-of-authority network relies
    on trusted nodes designated as “signers” that have the ability to create blocks.
    A majority of signers on the network are required to validate the chain (Wuehler,
    2018).

    validated, and made available from the blockchain; elements such as ingredients,
    animal well-being, nutrition facts, and additives can be related to healthiness,
    and customers evaluate overall food quality based on this information (Petrescu
    et al., 2019). Food quality, and its perception, is in fact often seen as a proxy
    for healthiness and well-being (Mascarello et al., 2015; Sadilek, 2019). In particular,
    it has been shown that customers show a relatively higher Willingness-to-Pay for
    elements such as animal welfare and organic production methods (Baltzer, 2004).
    Organic foods are perceived to be higher quality than traditional food (Loebnitz
    et al., 2016; Naspetti et al., 2009), and this Willingness-to-Pay concretizes
    when customers trust the information they receive about quality (Velčovská et
    al., 2015). More broadly, positive ethical attributes and quality generate a positive
    effect on customer Willingness-to-Pay (Auger et al., 2008; Homburg et al., 2005;
    Van Doorn et al., 2011).

    storage of food information in a unique format, thus leading to a convergence
    of the outputs of different sources within the supplycchain. Consequently, different
    players could also be incentivized to collaborate and share information to streamline
    processes and to improve outputs and, since the entire history of the product
    is available, comprehensive analysis, dashboards, and decision systems can be
    implemented and shared between different actors.

    and new research streams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additional supporting tools and methods might be introduced to minimize potential
    issues that stem from the quality of input data. The implementation of automated
    systems, consensus protocols, and hardened boxes that can not physically be tampered
    with, which gather and transform the data deriving from the sensors to an incontrovertible,
    certain input for the blockchain could increase the transparency of the firms
    and decrease the possibility of unproper usages (Dedeoglu et al., 2019). In fact,
    the data uploading process implies that the information created by the sensors
    becomes certified only after it is loaded on the blockchain. Thus, this information
    could be subject to sensor noises or the intervention of malicious actors both
    inside and outside the firm. Also, once inserted in the blockchain, mistakes or
    interventions, such as the aforementioned, cannot be corrected. The implementation
    of an ecosystem based on blockchain technology would then require high investments
    both in terms of technological infrastructure and of employee training, to counteract
    the potential uploading of incorrect data. Processes of data control which analyze
    the inputs before the upload could then become standardized in the sector.

    supply-chain stakeholders, and consortiums more aware of the blockchain’s benefits,
    to enhance adoption and to make the technology more widespread and familiar. This
    could generate additional positive effects, countering common objections having
    to do with the technology’s reliability and transparency (Biswas et al., 2017;
    Kshetri, 2018; Lu et al., 2017), while increasing consumers’ trust of blockchain-backed
    processes. In turn, higher trustworthiness could lower the related barriers encountered
    by consumers during the decision-making process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, the blockchain technology has relevant implications for adopters
    as regards to circular economy. Indeed, tracking the product from the early stage
    to the end customers also allows monitoring of the expired or unusable quantities
    of milk in each phase of the supply chain, aiding recycling. For example, it could
    become digestate utilized as a field fertilizer, or biogas employed for electricity
    production through a bio transformer, such as the one available at Maccarese S.p.A.
    Thus, the higher the quantity of information available on the product, the higher
    the likelihood of recovering nonmarketable products and using them to nurture
    the production process. This could have additional environmental benefits.

    be addressed by exploiting the growing funding opportunities made available by
    the EU (e.g., Horizon 2021–2027). In addition, the initial variable costs should
    lead to an increase of visibility, transparency, and security (De Giovanni, 2020).

- en: Indeed, while blockchain technology can effectively support firms and supply
    chain processes and information, little is known from a theoretical perspective
    about the effects on consumer behavior deriving from its adoption. Unmet research
    questions on this topic are the object of many analyses which have highlighted
    a lack of trust toward the technology (Dierksmeier et al., 2020; Kouhizadeh et
    al., 2018; Saberi et al., 2019; Venkatesh et al., 2020). Regarding transparency,
    some authors (Biswas et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Lu et al., 2017) have discussed
    the relevance of trust toward blockchain domains and highlighted that consumers
    tend to be averse toward the technology; as a consequence, they mistrust the information
    provided. Since transparency is one of the main advantages of implementing the
    technology, future studies could investigate the proper methods to present the
    technology and the information it produces, considering the nature of the platform
    as a way to shed light on the supply chains and the firms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, future research could assess whether food products cued with blockchain
    information positively alter either their adoption, or the perceived healthiness
    and tastiness according to the type of information provided on the sources of
    the end product, as well as the impact on Willingness-to-Buy, Willingness-to-Pay,
    and Word-of-Mouth intention. Consumers’ positive attitudes toward transparent,
    trustworthy, and socially responsible firms result in a higher intention to engage
    in positive word of mouth (Maxham et al., 2003). Companies involved in positive
    practices are also more likely to receive word of mouth from consumers (Handelman
    et al., 1999). Assuming blockchain as a technology is able to certify and validate
    supply chain information, consumers will be able to get more reliable messages
    (Biswas et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2017).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, as concerns about food safety and sustainability-related issues
    are increasingly dominating the consumer decision-making process (Tian, 2017),
    consumers are paying much more attention to the authenticity and legitimacy of
    the products they purchase (Abeyratne et al., 2016). As a consequence, they increasingly
    demand to know how, when, and where products are sourced and processed. In this
    vein, while considering the potential effect of perceived social responsibility
    on consumer behavior, blockchain could emerge as a technology able to ensure the
    truthfulness, accountability, and transparency of supply chain-related information
    (Biswas et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Lu et al., 2017).
  prefs: []

- en: Moreover, considering that the described project involves different actors in
    the supply chain, from the producer to the distributor, a further research avenue
    might explore the adoption of such a blockchain implementation to define differentiating
    elements of the value proposition and the impact on brand equity. As technological
    attributes associated with the product could be perceived as something unique
    and could increase perceptions of the healthiness of the product, it would also
    be relevant to understand the impact of the disclosure of all the information
    related to the product itself on the decision-making processes of consumers.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Initiatives promoting the implementation of blockchain technology are of paramount
    importance in the food sector, in order to increase information transparency and
    support end customers in making healthier food choices. Several initiatives have
    already been promoted with the goal of progressively introducing this technology
    to improve food traceability for the benefit of consumers and economies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To ensure widespread adoption along food supply chains, these initiatives cannot
    only focus on technology; education is also required. This has to be directed
    at consumers, who need to develop more trust in blockchain-backed technological
    as own supporting systems when deciding what to eat; at firms, to help them make
    data more accessible and understand the importance of contributing to public health
    by shedding light on their production processes; and to policymakers to encourage
    them to make adequate funding available for a fast adoption of the technology.
