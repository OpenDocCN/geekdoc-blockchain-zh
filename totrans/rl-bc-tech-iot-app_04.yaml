  zh: 摘要
- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing exponentially. It allows not only humans
    but also all various devices and objects in the environment to be connected over
    the Internet to share their data to create new applications and services which
    result in a more convenient and connected lifestyle. However, the current centralized
    IoT architecture faces several issues. For instance, all computing operations
    of all nodes in the network are carried out using a single server. This creates
    a single point of failure in which if the server goes down, the entire system
    will be unavailable. Also, the IoT centralized architecture is an easy target
    of various types of security and privacy attacks, since all IoT data collected
    from different devices is under the full authority of a single server. Therefore,
    adopting one of the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) for the IoT may be
    the right decision. One of the popular types of DLTs is the blockchain. It provides
    an immutable ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions
    by decentralizing the ledger among participating nodes in the blockchain network
    which eliminates the need for a central authority. Integrating the IoT system
    with the blockchain technology can provide several benefits which can resolve
    the issues associated with the IoT centralized architecture. Therefore, this chapter
    provides a discussion of the intersection between IoT and DLTs. It started by
    providing an overview of the DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits
    and challenges. The centralized IoT system is also discussed with highlighting
    its essential limitations. Then, the integration of blockchain with IoT is presented
    by highlighting the integration benefits. Various application and challenges of
    integrating blockchain with IoT are also discussed.

  zh: 物联网（IoT）正呈指数增长。它不仅允许人类，还允许环境中的各种设备和物体通过互联网连接，共享它们的数据，从而创造出新的应用程序和服务，使生活方式更加便利和互联。然而，当前的集中式物联网架构面临几个问题。例如，网络中所有节点的所有计算操作都是使用单个服务器执行的。这会在服务器故障时造成单点故障，导致整个系统不可用。此外，物联网集中式架构很容易成为各种安全和隐私攻击的目标，因为从不同设备收集的所有物联网数据都受单个服务器的完全控制。因此，采用分布式账本技术（DLTs）之一可能是正确的决定。区块链是一种流行的DLT类型之一。它提供了一个不可变的账本，通过将账本分散在区块链网络中参与节点之间来维护交易的完整性，从而消除了对中央机构的需求。将物联网系统与区块链技术集成可以提供几个好处，可以解决与物联网集中式架构相关的问题。因此，本章讨论了物联网和DLTs之间的交集。它首先概述了DLT，重点介绍了其主要组成部分、好处和挑战。还讨论了集中式物联网系统，并强调了其基本限制。然后，通过强调集成的好处，介绍了区块链与物联网的集成。还讨论了将区块链与物联网集成的各种应用和挑战。

- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolutionary technology that enables
    almost everything everywhere to be connected over the Internet. The IoT enables
    various devices and objects around us in the environment to be addressable, recognizable
    and locatable via cheap sensor devices. These devices can be connected and communicate
    with each other over the Internet using either wired or wireless communication
    networks [[1]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0010). These devices involve
    not only normal electronic devices or technological development products like
    vehicles, phones, etc., but also other objects such as food, animals, clothes,
    trees, etc. The key purpose of the IoT system is to allow various objects to be
    connected in anyplace, anytime by anyone preferably using any path/network and
    any service [[2]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0015).

  zh: 万物互联（IoT）代表了一项革命性技术，使几乎每件事情都可以通过互联网连接。 IoT通过廉价的传感器设备使我们周围环境中的各种设备和物体可寻址、可识别和可定位。
    这些设备可以通过有线或无线通信网络相互连接并在互联网上进行通信[[1]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0010)。
    这些设备不仅涉及普通电子设备或技术发展产品，如车辆、手机等，还涉及食物、动物、衣服、树木等其他物体。 IoT系统的关键目的是允许各种对象通过任何路径/网络和任何服务随时随地由任何人连接[[2]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0015)。
- en: Although the IoT system provides countless benefits in various domains, it faces
    several issues with the current centralized model in which all IoT devices and
    objects are identified, authenticated and controlled by a centralized server.
    This model faces many obstacles. For instance, it carries out all processing operations
    and controls all nodes in the network, which creates a single point of failure
    in which if the server goes down, the entire system will be unavailable [[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020).
    Also, security is another issue for the centralized model since all sensitive
    information stored in one location and under the reasonability of a single server
    which makes it an easy target for various types of attacks. Moreover, protecting
    the data privacy seems to be questionable, since the real-time data of IoT devices
    are collected and stored in a remote server outside the user control and with
    the authority of the centralized server only. In addition, the centralized architecture
    faces a scalability issue as it fits only for small businesses, but it will be
    an impractical solution for large organizations having many branches in a different
    location all over the world [[4]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0025).

  zh: 虽然物联网系统在各个领域提供了无数好处，但它在当前的集中式模型中面临着一些问题，即所有物联网设备和对象都由集中式服务器进行识别、认证和控制。这种模型面临着许多障碍。例如，它执行所有处理操作并控制网络中的所有节点，这会产生一个单点故障，即如果服务器崩溃，整个系统将不可用[[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020)。此外，安全性是集中式模型的另一个问题，因为所有敏感信息都存储在一个位置，并由单个服务器负责，这使其成为各种类型攻击的易目标。此外，保护数据隐私似乎是值得质疑的，因为物联网设备的实时数据被收集并存储在用户控制之外的远程服务器上，并且仅受集中式服务器的管理。此外，集中式架构面临可扩展性问题，因为它只适用于小型企业，但对于在世界各地拥有多个分支机构的大型组织来说，这将是一个不切实际的解决方案[[4]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0025)。
- en: On the other hand, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has gained a great attention
    in recent years as an innovative approach that provides a transparent and verifiable
    record of transactions. DLT combines a group of untrusted nodes in a distributed
    and decentralized environment. It has a massive potential to change how governments,
    organizations and institutions work. It can bring myriad advantages to various
    government activities such as tax collection, benefits associated with social
    security, passport issuance, licenses and voting. It can also provide several
    advantages to other applications such as music, finance, cyber security, public
    services, healthcare, etc. DLT provides an immutable ledger that cannot be changed
    or altered and eliminates the need for a centralized trusted third party [[5]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0030).

  zh: 另一方面，分布式账本技术（DLT）近年来受到了极大的关注，作为提供交易透明和可验证记录的创新方法。DLT将一组不受信任的节点结合在一个分布式和去中心化的环境中。它有巨大的潜力改变政府、组织和机构的工作方式。它可以为各种政府活动带来无数优势，如税收征收、社会保障相关的福利、护照发行、许可证和投票。它还可以为其他应用程序带来几个优势，如音乐、金融、网络安全、公共服务、医疗保健等。DLT提供了一个不可变的账本，无法更改或篡改，并消除了对集中式信任第三方的需求[[5]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0030)。
- en: With several limitations in the centralized IoT architecture, moving the IoT
    system into one of the distributed ledger technologies may be the right decision.
    One of the popular types of DLTs is the blockchain. It is defined as a distributed
    and decentralized ledger of transactions to manage a continuously growing group
    of records. To store a transaction in the ledger, the majority of participating
    nodes in the blockchain network should agree and record their consent. A set of
    transactions are grouped together and allocate a block in the ledger, which is
    chained of blocks [[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020). To link the
    blocks together, each block encompasses a timestamp and hash function to the previous
    block. The hash function validates the integrity and nonrepudiation of the data
    inside the block. Moreover, to keep all participating nodes of the blockchain
    network updated, each user holds a copy of the original ledger and all nodes are
    synchronized and updated with newly change.

  zh: 在集中式物联网架构中存在一些限制，将物联网系统转移到分布式账本技术之一可能是正确的决定。其中一种流行的分布式账本技术是区块链。它被定义为用于管理不断增长的记录组的分布式和去中心化交易账本。要将交易存储在账本中，区块链网络中的大多数参与节点应该同意并记录他们的同意。一组交易被分组在一起并分配一个账本中的块，这些块链接在一起[[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020)。为了将块链接在一起，每个块都包含一个时间戳和哈希函数指向前一个块。哈希函数验证块内数据的完整性和不可否认性。此外，为了保持区块链网络的所有参与节点更新，每个用户持有原始账本的副本，所有节点都与新的更改同步更新。
- en: Integrating the IoT with blockchain will have many advantages. For instance,
    adopting the decentralized architecture for the IoT system can solve many issues
    especially security and single point of failure, since the blockchain provides
    a decentralized and distributed environment where there is no need for a central
    authority to manage the execution of operations and control communication between
    various nodes in the network. This, in turn, provides a trusted environment where
    participating nodes are the only entities to accept or discard a transaction based
    on their consent [[6]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0035). Moreover, the
    blockchain provides better security for various IoT applications since it provides
    an immutable and tamper-proof ledger to protect data against malicious attacks
    in which any data update or modification will not be added to ledger unless the
    majority of participating nodes verify it [[7]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0040).

  zh: 将物联网与区块链整合将带来许多优势。例如，采用分散式架构对物联网系统进行建模可以解决许多问题，特别是安全性和单点故障问题，因为区块链提供了一个分散和分布式环境，无需中央机构来管理操作的执行和控制网络中各个节点之间的通信。这反过来又提供了一个值得信赖的环境，参与节点是唯一根据其同意接受或丢弃交易的实体[[6]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0035)。此外，区块链为各种物联网应用提供了更好的安全性，因为它提供了一个不可变和防篡改的账本，以保护数据免受恶意攻击，在这种攻击中，除非大多数参与节点验证，否则任何数据更新或修改都不会被添加到账本中[[7]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0040)。

    of nodes. The nodes are simply nodes which can perform operations from neighboring
    nodes across the network. The central server handles all requests coming from
    various nodes and assigns tasks to various nodes in the network. Typically, the
    communication between various nodes and the central server is like Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) connection in which when a connection has been created,
    messages are sent between the central server and the connected node. These messages
    can be such as registering the node and getting node address [[8]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0045).

  zh: 中心化系统依赖于一个中央服务器来管理一组节点。这些节点只是能够在网络中的相邻节点之间执行操作的节点。中央服务器处理来自各个节点的所有请求，并将任务分配给网络中的各个节点。通常，各个节点与中央服务器之间的通信类似于传输控制协议（TCP）连接，即一旦建立了连接，消息就在中央服务器和连接的节点之间发送。这些消息可以是注册节点和获取节点地址之类的消息[[8]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0045)。
- en: The centralized system has several advantages. For example, the entire responsibility
    of the network is placed under the full control of the central server so, it is
    easier to manage, maintain and control. In addition, the use of a central server
    saves the costs of having multiple hardware equipment. In other words, building
    a centralized system only need a central computer with the required hardware and
    software elements while other nodes could be just terminals. These terminals served
    only as an input/output method to connect various users to the central server.
    Also, if one terminal goes down, the user can simply use another terminal to access
    the stored files on the central server. Moreover, the centralized system provides
    better physical security since all data are stored in a central place, which makes
    it easier to protect against physical damage and reduces duplication and ensures
    data integrity since data are controlled by the central server which provides
    a uniform service for all nodes in the network.

    since the central server carries out all processing operations and controls all
    nodes connected to it, if the server crash, the entire system will be unavailable.
    This problem is called a single point of failure so if the single point, central
    server, is failed, all the system will go down. Moreover, since all computing
    achieved across the central server, the hardware specification should be good
    enough to serve all nodes in the network, if not, the nodes may wait for a long
    time to get their job done. Also, the central system is unfeasible in large organizations
    which have many branches in different sites all over the world [[9]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0050).

    makes their own independent decision based on its targets which may collide with
    other nodes targets. Nodes can connect and communicate with each other to share

    structure and organizational structure. In the pure structure, all nodes are responsible
    for taking their own decisions without having any authority to manage communication
    and operations between communicating nodes. While the organizational structure
    has a supernode for a small network to manage communication and take decisions
    on behalf of this subnetwork. These supernodes are connected with similar nodes
    in the network to share information and make decisions [[11]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0060).

    possibility of controlling and operating the entire system with only one central
    server, instead, it allows each node to take part in decision-making operations.
    In addition, the decentralized system carries decision-making operations closer
    to the scene of action which results in quick decisions that can save a lot of
    money. Also, the decentralized system is scalable and facilitate the expansion
    of organizations which results in opening a new business in different geographic

    nodes where if a node goes down, the entire system will not be affected which
    eliminates the problem of single point of failure associated with the centralized

  zh: 3.1 DLT 的定义
- en: DLT provides a universal data structure by combining a group of untrusted nodes
    in a distributed and environment. It provides an immutable ledger that cannot
    be changed or altered and eliminates the need for a centralized trusted third
    party. So, a centralized server is not required to manage operations and ensures
    trust between communicating parties instead, a distributed ledger is responsible
    for maintaining the trust by tracking the ownership of different nodes in the
    network. DLT has a huge potential to change how governments, organizations and
    institutions work. It can bring countless benefits to government activities such
    as tax collection, benefits associated with social security, passport issuance,
    licenses and voting. It can also provide several advantages to other applications
    such as music, finance, cyber security, public services, healthcare, etc. [[14]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0075).

  zh: DLT通过将一组不受信任的节点组合在一个分布式和环境中，提供了一个通用的数据结构。它提供了一个不可改变的账本，不能被更改或篡改，并消除了对中心化可信第三方的需求。因此，不需要集中式服务器来管理操作，并确保通信各方之间的信任，而是由分布式账本负责通过跟踪网络中不同节点的所有权来维护信任。DLT有巨大的潜力改变政府、组织和机构的运作方式。它可以为政府活动带来无数的好处，如税收征收、与社会安全相关的福利、护照发行、许可和投票。它还可以为其他应用提供几项优势，如音乐、金融、网络安全、公共服务、医疗保健等。[[14]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0075)。
- en: A distributed ledger is a form of database shared across multiple locations
    including organizations and countries. This ledger is shared and synchronized
    between different nodes of the network. It keeps all transactions of the participating
    nodes in the network [[15]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0080). There are
    other definitions for the DLT. For example, Investopedia [[16]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0085)
    described the DLT as “The technological infrastructure and protocols that allows
    simultaneous access, validation and record updating in an immutable manner across
    a network spread across multiple entities or locations.” Also, Financial Conduct
    Authority [[17]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0090) defined the DLT as
    “A set of technological solutions that enables a single, sequenced, standardized
    and cryptographically-secured record of activity to be safely distributed to,
    and acted upon by, a network of varied participants.” Also, Bank for International
    Settlements (BIS) [[18]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0095) defined the
    DLT as “the processes and related technologies that enable nodes in a network
    (or arrangement) to securely propose, validate and record state changes (or updates)
    to a synchronized ledger that is distributed across the network's nodes.”

    validator and auditor. The system administrator role is used to control the access
    to the system and provides certain management services. While asset issuer role
    is permissioned to issue new assets. Proposer role is used to propose updates
    to the ledger, whereas validator role confirms the validity of a proposed change
    in the ledger. The lowest role is auditor which allows the user to only view the
    ledger without the ability to make changes or updates.'

    nodes in the blockchain network should agree and record their consent. A set of
    transactions are grouped together and allocate a block in the ledger, which is
    chained of blocks. To link the blocks together, each block encompasses a timestamp
    and hash function to the previous block. The hash function validates the integrity
    and nonrepudiation of the data inside the block. Moreover, to keep all participating
    nodes of the blockchain network updated, each user holds a copy of the original

    that needs to be handled by issuing the appropriate laws which can cope with technological
    progress of both IoT and blockchain [[49]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0250).

- en: The IoT system involves billions of devices and objects with limited resources
    such as computing power and storage. These resource-constrained devices cannot
    participate in the consensus mechanisms such as PoW and PoS associated with the
    blockchain technology that require high processing power for the mining process.
    Since the mining process is a complex operation that needs a huge amount of energy,
    integrating sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with blockchain
    can be very efficient in optimizing energy consumption. So, therefore, more research
    is needed to investigate how to adopt consensus mechanisms in the IoT system [[6]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0035).

- en: The IoT has proven it can provide several benefits in various domains. It has
    evolved to include the perception of realizing a global infrastructure of interconnected
    networks of physical and virtual objects. These objects are interconnected using
    either wired or wireless networks to share information between various IoT devices
    to create novel applications and services. However, the current IoT centralized
    architecture faces many issues regarding security and scalability. One of the
    recommended solutions to resolve these challenges is the blockchain technology.
    It uses a decentralized and distributed ledger to utilize the processing capabilities
    of all the participating nodes in the blockchain network, which reduce latency
    and eliminate the single point of failure. Integrating the IoT system with blockchain
    can bring countless benefits. For instance, the decentralization feature of blockchain
    can process billions of transactions between IoT devices. This chapter provided
    a discussion of the intersection between IoT and DLTs. It started by providing
    an overview of DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits and challenges.
    The centralized IoT system is also discussed with highlighting its essential limitations.
    Then, the integration of blockchain with IoT is presented by highlighting the
    benefits of the integration process. Various application and challenges of blockchain
    with IoT are also discussed.
