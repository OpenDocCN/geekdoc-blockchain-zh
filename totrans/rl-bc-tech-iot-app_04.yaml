- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing exponentially. It allows not only humans
    but also all various devices and objects in the environment to be connected over
    the Internet to share their data to create new applications and services which
    result in a more convenient and connected lifestyle. However, the current centralized
    IoT architecture faces several issues. For instance, all computing operations
    of all nodes in the network are carried out using a single server. This creates
    a single point of failure in which if the server goes down, the entire system
    will be unavailable. Also, the IoT centralized architecture is an easy target
    of various types of security and privacy attacks, since all IoT data collected
    from different devices is under the full authority of a single server. Therefore,
    adopting one of the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) for the IoT may be
    the right decision. One of the popular types of DLTs is the blockchain. It provides
    an immutable ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions
    by decentralizing the ledger among participating nodes in the blockchain network
    which eliminates the need for a central authority. Integrating the IoT system
    with the blockchain technology can provide several benefits which can resolve
    the issues associated with the IoT centralized architecture. Therefore, this chapter
    provides a discussion of the intersection between IoT and DLTs. It started by
    providing an overview of the DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits
    and challenges. The centralized IoT system is also discussed with highlighting
    its essential limitations. Then, the integration of blockchain with IoT is presented
    by highlighting the integration benefits. Various application and challenges of
    integrating blockchain with IoT are also discussed.

    almost everything everywhere to be connected over the Internet. The IoT enables
    various devices and objects around us in the environment to be addressable, recognizable
    and locatable via cheap sensor devices. These devices can be connected and communicate
    with each other over the Internet using either wired or wireless communication
    networks [[1]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0010). These devices involve
    not only normal electronic devices or technological development products like
    vehicles, phones, etc., but also other objects such as food, animals, clothes,
    trees, etc. The key purpose of the IoT system is to allow various objects to be
    connected in anyplace, anytime by anyone preferably using any path/network and
    any service [[2]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0015).

    several issues with the current centralized model in which all IoT devices and
    objects are identified, authenticated and controlled by a centralized server.
    This model faces many obstacles. For instance, it carries out all processing operations
    and controls all nodes in the network, which creates a single point of failure
    in which if the server goes down, the entire system will be unavailable [[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020).
    Also, security is another issue for the centralized model since all sensitive
    information stored in one location and under the reasonability of a single server
    which makes it an easy target for various types of attacks. Moreover, protecting
    the data privacy seems to be questionable, since the real-time data of IoT devices
    are collected and stored in a remote server outside the user control and with
    the authority of the centralized server only. In addition, the centralized architecture
    faces a scalability issue as it fits only for small businesses, but it will be
    an impractical solution for large organizations having many branches in a different
    location all over the world [[4]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0025).

    in recent years as an innovative approach that provides a transparent and verifiable
    record of transactions. DLT combines a group of untrusted nodes in a distributed
    and decentralized environment. It has a massive potential to change how governments,
    organizations and institutions work. It can bring myriad advantages to various
    government activities such as tax collection, benefits associated with social
    security, passport issuance, licenses and voting. It can also provide several
    advantages to other applications such as music, finance, cyber security, public
    services, healthcare, etc. DLT provides an immutable ledger that cannot be changed
    or altered and eliminates the need for a centralized trusted third party [[5]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0030).

    system into one of the distributed ledger technologies may be the right decision.
    One of the popular types of DLTs is the blockchain. It is defined as a distributed
    and decentralized ledger of transactions to manage a continuously growing group
    of records. To store a transaction in the ledger, the majority of participating
    nodes in the blockchain network should agree and record their consent. A set of
    transactions are grouped together and allocate a block in the ledger, which is
    chained of blocks [[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020). To link the
    blocks together, each block encompasses a timestamp and hash function to the previous
    block. The hash function validates the integrity and nonrepudiation of the data
    inside the block. Moreover, to keep all participating nodes of the blockchain
    network updated, each user holds a copy of the original ledger and all nodes are
    synchronized and updated with newly change.

    adopting the decentralized architecture for the IoT system can solve many issues
    especially security and single point of failure, since the blockchain provides
    a decentralized and distributed environment where there is no need for a central
    authority to manage the execution of operations and control communication between
    various nodes in the network. This, in turn, provides a trusted environment where
    participating nodes are the only entities to accept or discard a transaction based
    on their consent [[6]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0035). Moreover, the
    blockchain provides better security for various IoT applications since it provides
    an immutable and tamper-proof ledger to protect data against malicious attacks
    in which any data update or modification will not be added to ledger unless the
    majority of participating nodes verify it [[7]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0040).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The centralized system is built depending on a central server to manage a set
    of nodes. The nodes are simply nodes which can perform operations from neighboring
    nodes across the network. The central server handles all requests coming from
    various nodes and assigns tasks to various nodes in the network. Typically, the
    communication between various nodes and the central server is like Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) connection in which when a connection has been created,
    messages are sent between the central server and the connected node. These messages
    can be such as registering the node and getting node address [[8]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0045).

    of the network is placed under the full control of the central server so, it is
    easier to manage, maintain and control. In addition, the use of a central server
    saves the costs of having multiple hardware equipment. In other words, building
    a centralized system only need a central computer with the required hardware and
    software elements while other nodes could be just terminals. These terminals served
    only as an input/output method to connect various users to the central server.
    Also, if one terminal goes down, the user can simply use another terminal to access
    the stored files on the central server. Moreover, the centralized system provides
    better physical security since all data are stored in a central place, which makes
    it easier to protect against physical damage and reduces duplication and ensures
    data integrity since data are controlled by the central server which provides
    a uniform service for all nodes in the network.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the centralized system has multiple shortcomings. For example,
    since the central server carries out all processing operations and controls all
    nodes connected to it, if the server crash, the entire system will be unavailable.
    This problem is called a single point of failure so if the single point, central
    server, is failed, all the system will go down. Moreover, since all computing
    achieved across the central server, the hardware specification should be good
    enough to serve all nodes in the network, if not, the nodes may wait for a long
    time to get their job done. Also, the central system is unfeasible in large organizations
    which have many branches in different sites all over the world [[9]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0050).

    different nodes in the network without the need for a centralized server to manage
    operation execution and make decisions on behalf of other nodes. So, each node
    makes their own independent decision based on its targets which may collide with
    other nodes targets. Nodes can connect and communicate with each other to share
    information and provide various services to other nodes [[10]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0055).

- en: There are two basic structures for a decentralized system, pure decentralized
    structure and organizational structure. In the pure structure, all nodes are responsible
    for taking their own decisions without having any authority to manage communication
    and operations between communicating nodes. While the organizational structure
    has a supernode for a small network to manage communication and take decisions
    on behalf of this subnetwork. These supernodes are connected with similar nodes
    in the network to share information and make decisions [[11]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0060).

    possibility of controlling and operating the entire system with only one central
    server, instead, it allows each node to take part in decision-making operations.
    In addition, the decentralized system carries decision-making operations closer
    to the scene of action which results in quick decisions that can save a lot of
    money. Also, the decentralized system is scalable and facilitate the expansion
    of organizations which results in opening a new business in different geographic
    locations. Moreover, in contrast to the centralized model, the failing of one
    node will not affect the entire system, so there is no single point of failure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The decentralized system is not straightforward. It suffers some difficulties
    and challenges. For example, it increases costs as each node needs enough processing
    power and memory to execute operations and make decisions independently. Also,
    it increases the coordination problem between various subnetworks [[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020).

    form a single and integrated coherent network with a huge processing and storage
    power to achieve a certain goal. The peers are communicated by passing messages
    to one another. The combination of storage and processioning capabilities allows
    the distributed system to perform complex and large tasks faster than other systems
    by dividing tasks into multiple subtasks and distributed it among network nodes
    which process and execute their subtasks and return the result to the main node
    to collect and constitute the final result [[12]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0065).

    the overall performance of the system by distributing the computational load across
    different nodes which provides less load at each node, which in turn increases
    the performance of the entire system. Also, it provides a reliable network of
    nodes where if a node goes down, the entire system will not be affected which
    eliminates the problem of single point of failure associated with the centralized
    system. In addition, since distributed systems operate with a diversity of different
    nodes, it provides a scalable system which can adjust their processing resources

    “A set of technological solutions that enables a single, sequenced, standardized
    and cryptographically-secured record of activity to be safely distributed to,
    and acted upon by, a network of varied participants.” Also, Bank for International
    Settlements (BIS) [[18]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0095) defined the

    and decentralized ledger of transactions used to manage a constantly increasing
    set of records. To store a transaction in the ledger, the majority of participating
    nodes in the blockchain network should agree and record their consent. A set of
    transactions are grouped together and allocate a block in the ledger, which is
    chained of blocks. To link the blocks together, each block encompasses a timestamp
    and hash function to the previous block. The hash function validates the integrity
    and nonrepudiation of the data inside the block. Moreover, to keep all participating
    nodes of the blockchain network updated, each user holds a copy of the original
    ledger and all nodes are synchronized and updated with newly change [[3]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0020).

    of paperwork involved for each transaction between a supplier and retailer. This
    creates a big problem especially with growing the business size. Blockchain along
    with smart contracts can solve issues of the supply chain and reduce costs, time
    and efforts. It delivers the required scalability for supply chain by providing
    a large database that can be accessed from multiple locations around the world.
    Also, the blockchain technology can be adopted in a private manner to maintain
    data integrity across multiple participants. It also provides higher standards

    privacy of healthcare data collected and transmitted in real-time. Adopting the
    blockchain technology in the healthcare sector can add numerous improvements.
    For instance, blockchain can provide an immutable ledger of medical records that
    cannot be altered once it created and signed. This, in turn, can increase the
    integrity of medical records. Another benefit of the blockchain is the consent
    management. Since the existing healthcare system has different privacy and consent
    regulations at every stage, the blockchain can be utilized to store the patient
    consent for purposes of data sharing, so any third-party can check the blockchain

    over the Internet with poor built-in security measures. This makes it a desirable
    target for most security attacks. To improve the security of the IoT system, most
    security experts and researchers have confirmed that integrating blockchain with
    IoT can resolve this issue; however, one of the key challenges of providing a
    secure IoT system is the reliability of the data generated by IoT devices. Indeed,
    blockchain provides an immutable and tamper-proof ledger that ensures data integrity;
    however, if the data are corrupted before storing it in the blockchain, it will
    stay corrupted. The data can be corrupted either by a malicious intruder or the
    devices themselves and their sensors fail to work correctly from the start. Therefore,
    IoT devices need to be tested before their integration with the blockchain and
    apply appropriate techniques to detect device failures immediately [[69]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0350).

    of the blockchain to scale to meet the security requirements of a dynamic network
    containing billions of devices. Although the integration between blockchain and
    IoT provides myriad benefits such as authentication, data integrity, fault tolerance
    and security, it comes at the price of scalability. The existing blockchain platforms
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can process only seven and 20 transactions per second,
    respectively. This processing speed cannot handle the processing requirements
    of the IoT system with billions of transactions. Also, the limited bandwidth associated
    with the blockchain technology cannot enable real-time transaction processing.
    Although there were several proposed blockchain scaling solutions over the last
    years, the scalability is still the major issue facing the convergence of blockchain
    with IoT [[53]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0270).

    data. These data should be anonymously stored and protected against any data modification.
    The integration of blockchain with IoT has promised to provide a secure and immutable
    environment; however, the data privacy faces several issues especially in transparent
    and public blockchains where all participating nodes in the blockchain network
    can view values of all transactions, so the blockchain cannot guarantee transactions'
    privacy [[70]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0355). Also, as indicated by
    Barcelo [[71]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0360), the user's transaction
    can be linked to disclose user's personal information. Therefore, the privacy

    However, blockchain is not designed to store large amounts of data like those
    produced in the IoT system. The storage capacity is considered one of the big
    problems of the blockchain technology, but with integrating blockchain with IoT,
    this issue will become much greater. Also, as distributed ledger keeps all transactions
    that have ever made in the network, the size of the ledger will increase with
    increasing number of participating nodes in the network. The storage issue is
    still one of the biggest challenges for the integration of blockchain with IoT;
    therefore, more research and new approaches are needed to resolve this issue [[4]](S0065245818300688_split_001.xhtml#bb0025).

    of devices to build a more secure and trusted IoT network. In this sense, laws
    that deal with information privacy and information handling are still a big challenge
    to be tackled in the IoT and will be an even bigger challenge after integrating
    blockchain with IoT. The blockchain can collect various nodes from different countries
    without having any legal or compliance code to follow, which is a serious issue

    Since the mining process is a complex operation that needs a huge amount of energy,

    evolved to include the perception of realizing a global infrastructure of interconnected
    networks of physical and virtual objects. These objects are interconnected using
    either wired or wireless networks to share information between various IoT devices
    to create novel applications and services. However, the current IoT centralized
    architecture faces many issues regarding security and scalability. One of the
    recommended solutions to resolve these challenges is the blockchain technology.
    It uses a decentralized and distributed ledger to utilize the processing capabilities
    of all the participating nodes in the blockchain network, which reduce latency
    and eliminate the single point of failure. Integrating the IoT system with blockchain
    can bring countless benefits. For instance, the decentralization feature of blockchain
    can process billions of transactions between IoT devices. This chapter provided
    a discussion of the intersection between IoT and DLTs. It started by providing
    an overview of DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits and challenges.
    The centralized IoT system is also discussed with highlighting its essential limitations.
    Then, the integration of blockchain with IoT is presented by highlighting the
    benefits of the integration process. Various application and challenges of blockchain
    with IoT are also discussed.
