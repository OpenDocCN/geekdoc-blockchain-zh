    technology. The impact will be felt in every country in a slightly different way.
    In the western world, we might see the advent of things like transparent mortgage-backed
    securities traded on blockchain-enabled exchanges. In China, blockchain integration
    is already happening with things like notarization, an essential component of
    real estate transactions. In the developing world, blockchains hold the most promise
    because they may be able to free capital and increase trade.

- en: Title insurance is necessary in places that use common law to govern their title
    systems. The buyer is responsible for ensuring that the seller’s title is good.
    Within these systems, a title search is done and insurance is bought. In areas

    common law title systems. The idea is simple: Blockchains are fantastic public

    system has its own land records office, where all the deeds or records that transfer
    title to any piece of land or any interest in any land in the county are recorded

  zh: 区块链可能会触发货币传输法律和监管。在美国，联邦层面更清楚哪些企业被视为货币传输者。鉴于所有重要的公共区块链目前都使用加密货币代币来驱动安全性，这个问题变得令人困惑，这导致了私人和许可区块链的出现，它们可以在没有代币的情况下运行。
- en: State licensure requirements are ambiguous for companies using blockchain technology
    for applications other than payments. Regulations and laws will be enacted to
    protect consumers. Europe already has laws around “being forgotten.” Compliance
    with these rules could be tricky when data entered into blockchains is around
    forever and can’t be removed by anyone, even if they wanted to.

  zh: 对于使用区块链技术进行非支付应用的公司，州的许可要求还不够清晰。将会颁布法规和法律来保护消费者。欧洲已经有关于“被遗忘”的法律。遵守这些规定在区块链上输入的数据将永远存在且无法被任何人删除，即使他们愿意。
- en: Being engaged in money transmission in many U.S. states is a felony. The hard
    consequences of overstepping law through innovation compel blockchain companies
    to spend significantly more money and time on compliance — to the tune of an average
    of $2 million to $5 million per year per company. The legal fees are heavy burdens
    for these technology startups.

  zh: 在许多美国州从事货币传输是重罪。通过创新超越法律的严格后果迫使区块链公司在合规方面花费更多的资金和时间，每家公司平均每年需要花费200万至500万美元的法律费用。这些法律费用对这些科技创业公司来说是沉重的负担。

    New York has increased the cost to be in compliance and driven innovation to move

- en: 'Luxembourg created a legal framework for electronic payment establishments
    in 2011 and was early on the idea of “electronic money.” Luxembourg and the UK
    have become home to many blockchain companies because the regulatory environment
    is easier for them to navigate and afford. For less than $1 million, blockchain
    businesses can obtain a payment instrument license in the European Union. This

    problems seen in other parts of the world. They’ve been quick to use blockchains
    to supplement what they’ve already been doing, adding layers of certainty to things
    like Internet of Things (IoT) and notarization. Whereas Western countries have
    a more distributed and decentralized power structure, China has a more centralized
    one. This allows China to move quickly to both regulate and innovate.

    countries, which often have a greater need for technology, yet don’t have the
    same resources or the right political environment to allow those innovations to
    take root. Some small countries try protectionist measures that block the importation
    of goods that could be made within their borders; other countries mistrust the
    quality and benevolence of products and services that come from the outsides sources
    as well. On a darker note, some political systems benefit too greatly from the
    inefficiencies and ambiguities that their legal system has in place to change.

    on an informal economy and the importance of business and property rights. One
    of the prominent issues that keeps the developing world undeveloped is *dead capital.*
    The property which is informally held and not legally recognized or the current
    systems in place cannot be trusted. For owners of this land, it is difficult or
    impossible to finance and sell. The uncertainty also decreases the value of the
    assets. The western world has been able to borrow against assets and sell them
    relatively freely. This has driven innovation and economic prosperity.

- en: As many roadblocks as developing countries have toward development and innovation,
    they also have advantages that western countries will never overcome. The lack
    of existing infrastructure in developing countries makes it easier for them to

    in developing countries. Developing countries also don’t have the same regulatory
    bodies and consumer protections. This is particularly attractive for blockchain
    startups that fall into the gray zone in western countries. Developing countries
