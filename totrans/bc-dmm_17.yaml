    technology. The impact will be felt in every country in a slightly different way.
    In the western world, we might see the advent of things like transparent mortgage-backed
    securities traded on blockchain-enabled exchanges. In China, blockchain integration
    is already happening with things like notarization, an essential component of
    real estate transactions. In the developing world, blockchains hold the most promise
    because they may be able to free capital and increase trade.

- en: '*Title insurance* is compensation for financial loss from defects in your title
    for a real estate purchase. It’s required if you take out a mortgage on your home
    or if you refinance it. Title insurance protects the bank’s investment against
    title problems that might not be found in the public records, are missed in the
    title search, or occur from fraud or forgery.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Title insurance is necessary in places that use common law to govern their title
    systems. The buyer is responsible for ensuring that the seller’s title is good.
    Within these systems, a title search is done and insurance is bought. In areas
    that use a Torrens title system a buyer can rely on the information in the land
    register and doesn’t need to look beyond those records.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Blockchain technology has been proposed as a supplement to help consumers in
    common law title systems. The idea is simple: Blockchains are fantastic public
    recordkeeping systems; they also can’t be backdated or changed without a record.
    In theory, blockchains could transform common law systems into distributed Torrens
    title systems.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, though, many challenges must be overcome. Each county in a common law
    system has its own land records office, where all the deeds or records that transfer
    title to any piece of land or any interest in any land in the county are recorded
    and noted. The United States alone has thousands of counties. The thousands of
    individual offices create silos of data. Blockchain doesn’t change the law or
    how the records are organized.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: New laws would need to be created that dictate that all interest and transfer
    of land must be recorded within a single system to be valid. Then it’s just a
    Torrens system and may make blockchain technology redundant. The exception would
    be in areas where there is a lot of fraud within the land registry.

    be a high regulatory burden, government-granted monopolies, or high startup costs.
    The industry that has built up around the buying and selling of real estate hasn’t
    changed much in the last 40 years and is ripe for disruption. Many different parties

    and find a home. He often helps you negotiate a price and communicates with the
    seller on your behalf. This service is valuable, and it’s not likely to be displaced
    by blockchain technology. You can already buy a home without a real estate agent
    — people choose to work with them because they improve the process.'

    you buy it — defects that could cost you money down the road. The defects home
    inspectors find can be used to negotiate with the seller for a better price. In
    the future, homes will continue to have wear and tear — that’ll never change.
    But blockchain technology could be used to record repairs to property and defects
    found in the inspection.'

    representatives could be built into smart contracts or chaincode.'

    property and determine how much it’s worth. The appraisal process is done every
    time a property is bought or refinanced. Companies like Zillow have taken a lot
    of the legwork out of knowing the market value, but each home is unique and needs
    to be assessed periodically. Even in the real estate mortgage process, multiple
    appeals may be called for to meet everyone’s needs. It might be useful to record
    this data within a blockchain as a public witness.'

    and mortgage provider. In most industries, the cost of doing business goes down
    over time — improvements in efficiency brought about by competition and innovation
    contribute to driving down cost. The mortgage industry is attractive as a candidate
    for blockchain innovation, because the opposite has occurred: The cost of business
    has gone up. The typical U.S. mortgage is over 500 pages and costs $7,500 to originate.
    This is three times what it cost ten years ago. Blockchain technology can meet
    the needs of protecting the buyer, seller, and mortgage provider while reducing
    the cost to do so.  ### Consumers and Fannie Mae'

    enterprise and a publicly traded company. It’s currently the leading source of
    financing for mortgage lenders and has dominated the market post-recession as
    private money left.
  prefs: []

    have come through Fannie Mae. This is about $5 trillion in mortgage assets. With
    few exceptions, loans that are not done through Fannie Mae or its close cousin,
    Freddie Mac, are jumbo loans (typically more than $417,000 each). These loans
    are still funded through private money.
  prefs: []

    It helps them navigate guidelines for a conventional loan. Lenders run your loan
    application through Fannie Mae’s computer system, and it spits out an answer of
    either approve or decline for your loan. Online platforms are using this new software
    to reach consumers, allowing them to bypass traditional retail locations. Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac are exploring blockchain technology to even further streamline
    this process and reach customers directly.  ## Mortgages in the Blockchain World'

    fear fines that they can incur if they mess up any part of the mortgage process.
    So, the industry has put in steps to help make sure that they meet all the requirements
    at the time of origination and years later when they’re audited. Big banks have
    paid billions in fines from the mishandling of documents. They’re now required
    not only to have all the essential documents, but also to prove that they followed
    the correct process and sent you all the necessary documents.'

    into their process after the recession. Recordkeeping and auditing expenses have
    skyrocketed since the introduction of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
    Protection Act, and blockchain technology could reduce that cost.

    need to let banks prove that they followed the guidelines set out in Dodd–Frank.
    It would also help banks document why they made certain decisions on loans, and
    help them locate documents that were used in origination, even if they aren’t
    in possession of them.

- en: 'Blockchain applications could put close to $4,000 back on the table for the
    average home purchase. The mortgage industry is a lot like the car loan industry
    and the credit card industry. Similar applications could reduce the administration
    cost that these industries have due to consumer protection laws, while at the
    same time letting companies meet those requirements.  ### Knowing your last-known
    document'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the largest cost drivers in the mortgage origination process often comes
    years after the loan was first made. Sometimes those facilitating the loan process
    add unneeded documents into client files, or old files that aren’t used to originate
    a loan are left in the folder. Also, duplicate records may occur. When it comes
    time to audit the file, there is too much information to sift through. Banks pay
    money to outside firms to check their records and try to determine what documents
    were used in the final dissection on your loan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain software can solve this problem in an elegant way. Blockchains are
    distributed recordkeeping systems that allow for multiple parties to collaborate
    on data over time without losing track of what that data looked like at any given
    point along the way. This means that the half dozen individual organizations that
    collaborate to help you buy your home can now all interact on the same chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A chain in this use case would start with you. Your chain would then have subchains
    added to it over time, such as the purchase of a home. You could then authorize
    others — such as banks, employers, credit agencies, appraisal companies, and the
    like — to write against the chain. They would each add their data to your chain,
    and the other authorized parties could read this data and add their own.

    automate some of the processing of the paperwork, and would always give a clear
    history of your loan, reducing the need to audit and prepare documents to be verified.

    solution. It is often met with fear because many people don’t understand how it

    illicit and illegal things being done with the technology.

    States, it’s clearer at a federal level what types of businesses are considered
    money transmitters. Given that all the essential public blockchains currently

    given rise to private and permission blockchains that operate without tokens.

    forever and can’t be removed by anyone, even if they wanted to.

    for these technology startups.
