    of the consensus process. Computer security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, author

    It is like the trust you have when you ask a calculator to compute the square
    root of 3 and it responds with 1.7320508\. You would not expect anyone to challenge
    that answer because it is a simple calculation for a machine to perform. But what
    if you are using an online calculator written as a project by a computer science
    student, who made some programming mistakes? Or what if you are asking for a more
    complex calculation, like the future price of a stock or the chance that a felon
    will commit another crime if let out early on parole? You might not be so confident.

    and illegitimate transactions in a way that an objective one could not. As Buterin
    notes, “Concepts like manipulation, takeovers, and deceit, not detectable or in
    some cases even definable in pure cryptography, can be understood by the human
    community surrounding the protocol just fine.” Buterin highlighted the distinction

    private key to receive the funds. Multisig allows the sender to specify that some
    fraction of a larger number of keys is required. The most common multisig arrangement
    requires two of three keys. This allows a simple arbitration process. If both
    parties agree, their keys are sufficient to consummate the transaction. If they
    disagree, the holder of the third key breaks the tie. That third key-holder would
    typically be a neutral party selected in advance of such a situation. Multisig

    or technology.”^([12](#chapter6-12)) When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in his Bitcoin
    whitepaper that he “proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying
    on trust,” he actually meant something much narrower. Electronic transactions
    in bitcoin can be trusted as valid without a discrete trustworthy third party,
    such as a government or bank, to verify them. That is indeed a dramatic change.
    There are a surprising number of situations in which the need to trust certain
    parties creates inefficiencies, conflicts, and failures. What unites Bitcoin and
    the distributed ledger platforms it inspired is a commitment to limiting the scope
    of that trust. Perversely, reducing the necessarily trust in some parts of a system
    may make the whole most trustworthy. Yet that is very different than saying that
    trust is absent. Just ask the customers of QuadrigaCX.

    the ether did not disappear. Anyone could still view the records identifying the
    currency on the Ethereum distributed ledger. Yet for the customers involved, it
    was as if a stack of $100 bills were locked in an impenetrable safe, with no key.^([14](#chapter6-14))
    If this were traditional money sitting in a vault or the electronic records of
    a bank, there would be no problem. The bank by definition would have custody over
    the funds. It would have the ability—even if it were reluctant or legally restrained
    in exercising it—to release the funds. But that is exactly the form of “relying
    on trust” that Satoshi negated.

    如果这是躺在金库中的传统货币，或者是一家银行的电子记录，那就不会有问题。银行按定义就有对这些资金的保管权。它会有能力——即使它犹豫不决或受到法律限制——释放这些资金。但这就正是中本聪所否定的“依赖信任”的形式。

    that made it impossible for QuadrigaCX to recover their funds once they are cryptographically
    locked away. This is the dark side of immutability. Banks and governments and
    others do not change transactions after the fact because they simply cannot. Where
    reliance on others is a cause for concern, this minimization of third-party trust
    makes participants more willing to transact. Perversely, though, that requires
    more trust on the part of participants. It is a leap of faith to engage in valuable

    edges of the ledgers. Even when value is encoded into decentralized systems, the
    access points may be through centralized edge services. For example, an individual
    who stores bitcoin with a consumer-oriented wallet service such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info,
    or Xapo must trust that provider in the same manner as with a bank. The wallet
    provider stores the private cryptographic keys for its customers, which allows
    them to access their cryptocurrency through a standard user name and password.
    However, if the wallet provider is hacked, the keys become vulnerable. The fact
    that the wallet is connected to a distributed ledger does not make the wallet
    service itself inherently more decentralized than a traditional web-based service,
    nor does it make the wallet itself any more secure. As Nick Szabo tweeted, “Bitcoin
    is the most secure financial network on the planet. But its centralized peripheral
    companies are among the most insecure.”^([47](#chapter6-47)) It is estimated that

    Szabo所发推文：“比特币是世界上最安全的金融网络。但其所依赖的集中式边缘公司却是最不安全的。”^([47](#chapter6-47)) 据悉，ICO中筹集的以太币的10%已经被盗，主要是从钱包中盗取的。^([48](#chapter6-48))

    through an edge provider, it can be subjected to legal enforcement. That might

    are wise leaders who can enforce decisions by changing the code, how is that any
    different than centralized development projects such as Linux, or Facebook for

    as whether to contribute computing power to mining a cryptocurrency or which chain
    to follow after a fork, do not involve market transactions. Moreover, the term

    not perfect, but trust necessarily involves some risk. The legal enforcement mechanism
    may reduce the possibility and magnitude of loss from untrustworthiness enough
    to induce trust-based relationships. Moreover, law formalizes relationships. Knowing
    the scope of expectations on both sides, as well as placing the entire arrangement
    within a structure, can limit misunderstandings. Thus, even though legal enforcement
    rests on the Leviathan of state power, law may create necessary space for the
    informal arrangements of P2P trust. In the formulation from chapter 1 of trust
    as confident vulnerability, the prospect of legal redress makes the actor feel
    less vulnerable, thus expanding her or his confidence to interact.

    can be tools for government just as much as alternatives to it. “Censorship resistance”
    turns into “unhackable official records” when government is the one responsible
    for the information. In addition, the public records form the basis for significant
    private industries. One offshoot of the American system of land registration is
    the need for expensive private title insurance for even routine real estate transactions.
    Goldman Sachs estimates that moving to distributed ledgers could reduce title
    insurance costs in the U.S. by $2 billion to $4 billion annually, thanks to improved

    These are works whose rights-holders cannot be located. They may well be in the
    public domain, but there is no easy way to tell. Those hoping to use these works,
    such as documentary filmmakers incorporating archival footage, cannot negotiate
    a license even if they want to. Orphan works are thus in legal limbo. The risk
    of statutory damages for copyright infringement—up to $150,000 per work regardless
    of actual harm—is a severe threat that scares away potential users of the material.
    The marketplace envisioned by copyright law fails to develop, and creativity is
    chilled. And this is not a small problem. When librarians at Carnegie Mellon University
    attempted to digitize their collection of books, they could not find the rights-holders
    for roughly a quarter of the works sampled.^([54](#chapter8-54))

    of nonfraudulent publishers. Advertisers will vote, using tokens, on whether the
    site is legitimate. A better and more complete whitelist will make the tokens
    more valuable, which incentivizes everyone to participate honestly in the system.
    Once the whitelist is established, advertisers can factor it into their decisions

    can be used to pay for drugs does not by itself raise legal problems for the cryptocurrency;
    Chinese yuan, dollars, or bars of gold can do the same. The challenge is that
    a private, decentralized currency that is pseudonymous or anonymous makes it easier

    A related concern is that blockchain technology, by creating decentralized digital
    bearer instruments, creates an attractive target for thieves. These two problems,
    typified in Silk Road and Mt. Gox respectively, were the most prominent legal

    usually definitional. There is no formal definition of what counts as a blockchain,
    cryptocurrency, distributed ledger, or smart contract. Industry groups such as
    the Chamber of Digital Commerce and organizations such as the Uniform Law Commission,
    a group of experts that proposes model laws to state legislatures, are working
    on proposed definitions, but the proper formulation will vary depending on the
    circumstances. The attributes that make a corporate record valid on a blockchain
    are different from those relevant for evidence in court. For example, the Delaware
    legislation does not mention blockchains at all, referring simply to “distributed
    electronic networks or databases.”^([19](#chapter9-19)) There are so many legal
    contexts involving records and validity of information that working through them,
    jurisdiction by jurisdiction, will be a slow process.

    law in 2000, the E-SIGN Act, mandating that a signature “may not be denied legal
    effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.”^([20](#chapter9-20))
    This automatically preempted state laws requiring paper signatures, removing the
    need to change them case by case. It left open the question of whether a digital
    signature was enforceable in any specific case by requiring only that the electronic
    form could not be the sole reason for invalidation. Thus, some electronic signatures
    must be cryptographically secured, while in other cases, typing one’s initials
    on an electronic form is sufficient. This matches the variation with physical
    signatures. Some documents can just be signed with the parties’ initials, while
    others require witnesses, notaries, and other formalities.

    However, the general approach of validating blockchain and distributed-ledger
    records as a category, so long as they meet the security and other requirements
    of the particular legal application, would speed the process of adoption. As with
    digital signatures, blockchain validity is relevant both for private law matters,
    such as contract enforcement, and for public law issues, such as regulated industries
    (healthcare and financial services, primarily), government services, and government-maintained

    regulation is disclosure. Investment involves risk, and no one is entitled to
    legal protection against a bad decision. However, without regulation, there is

    private offerings can be made only to accredited investors with the financial
    resources and sophistication to take on the risk. All offerings, especially public

    online games, such as Clash of Clans and Candy Crush, sell users digital tokens
    for real money. Yet these tokens are clearly not securities because their primary
    purpose is to aid in the game. Purchasers have no expectation that they can sell
    them back to make money. Even if there is intent to profit, an offering may not
    be a security when the purchasers are active participants in the success of the

    registered and regulated as such.^([24](#chapter9-24)) It was clearly marketed
    as an investment opportunity, with purchasers of tokens entitled to returns based
    on the performance of the projects funded. And the SEC concluded that, for all
    the hype about The DAO being a distributed, autonomous entity, The DAO token purchasers
    were essentially relying on the managerial activities of Slock.it, the software
    developer. Its employees wrote the code, oversaw the operations of the system,
    and delegated curator functions to coordinate with projects seeking funding. Token
    holders’ ability to influence the operation of The DAO were limited. When the
    hack drained a substantial portion of the funds, investors had no recourse but
    to turn to Slock.it and the Ethereum Foundation to make them whole.

    Ethereum also launched by selling tokens that appreciated in value. The agency
    did not explicitly step through the analysis, and it still could reconsider this
    classification in the future. A key distinction is likely that ether has significant
    utility above and beyond being a way to invest in the success of the Ethereum
    Foundation’s efforts. Just as the primary function of bitcoin is to buy things,
    the primary function of ether is to obtain the gas necessary for executing smart
    contracts. Ether purchasers are active contributors to the success of the enterprise
    in a way that DAO token purchasers were not. Especially when Ethereum launched
    its crowdsale in 2014, well before the 2017 ICO gold rush, purchasers were not
    necessarily focused on profit. And the Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that
    only holds a small amount of the total ether in circulation. The facts and circumstances

    reason that some ICO tokens are so highly valued is that, in addition to whatever
    utility they have within their platform, they can be traded for other cryptocurrencies
    or fiat. The option to cash out new tokens, however, depends on the willingness
    of exchanges to list them. Most cryptocurrency exchanges were not set up as regulated
    secondary markets in securities, and thus have strong incentives to avoid listing
    tokens that might subject them to regulatory sanctions. Or they might suddenly

    utility, could be outside the *Howey* requirements. However, even if something

    it still constitutes a security if marketed primarily as a passive investment.
    The SEC made this clear in its enforcement action against the ICO of a restaurant
    review start-up called Munchee.^([32](#chapter9-32)) Munchee actively promoted
    the tokens based on potential price appreciation as adoption grew, rather than
    as a way to participate actively in the network. A good regulatory scheme would

    than through traditional angel and early-stage venture capital channels. As of
    October 2017, fewer than 10 percent of token networks with completed ICOs were

    office of the U.S. Treasury Department, announced a civil enforcement action against
    Ripple, one of the first successful non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency networks. Ripple
    was designed to support international transactions between different currencies.

    as a regulated money-services business. There was nothing wrong with processing
    money transfers; the issue was doing so without having to meet the obligations
    of existing players in that industry. In particular, Ripple failed to follow the
    AML/KYC rules for its users. These are designed to prevent criminals and terrorists
    from using the banking system to support their activities. In response to the
    FinCEN action, Ripple agreed to a $450,000 fine and committed to establish an

    could fairly be said to induce lawbreaking. The *Grokster* inducement test is

    and anonymity primarily as a means to avoid legal enforcement. OpenBazaar, like
    the second-generation file-sharing services, seems to be a distributed extension
    of these banned marketplaces.^([46](#chapter9-46)) It allows buyers and sellers

    and rating system that it believes will help police illegal activity.^([48](#chapter9-48))

    To use the famous line from the movie *Casablanca*, Silk Road’s and Grokster’s
    creators were shocked, shocked to see this illicit activity going on. OpenBazaar’s
    creators take a different tack. They and their investors realize that they will
    need to convince regulators of their integrity. Augur, discussed in chapter 8,
    faces a similar burden for its blockchain-based prediction market. And in the

    it picked one that was not only a clear case, but already dead. The DAO already
    had returned all contributions after the hard fork and shut down. There was no
    need for the SEC to take any enforcement action. But its analysis could serve
    as a warning shot to the market, giving guidance for those uncertain about its
    views. Even as the agency began taking subsequent enforcement actions, its chair,
    Jay Carney, put out a statement emphasizing that “ICOs—whether they represent
    offerings of securities or not—can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others
    to raise funding, including for innovative projects.”^([54](#chapter9-54))

    The most difficult questions will involve offerings like The DAO, where failure
