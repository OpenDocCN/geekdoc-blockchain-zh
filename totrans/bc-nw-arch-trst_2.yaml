    notes, “Concepts like manipulation, takeovers, and deceit, not detectable or in
    some cases even definable in pure cryptography, can be understood by the human
    community surrounding the protocol just fine.” Buterin highlighted the distinction

    fraction of a larger number of keys is required. The most common multisig arrangement

    parties agree, their keys are sufficient to consummate the transaction. If they
    disagree, the holder of the third key breaks the tie. That third key-holder would

    or technology.”^([12](#chapter6-12)) When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in his Bitcoin
    whitepaper that he “proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying
    on trust,” he actually meant something much narrower. Electronic transactions
    in bitcoin can be trusted as valid without a discrete trustworthy third party,
    such as a government or bank, to verify them. That is indeed a dramatic change.
    There are a surprising number of situations in which the need to trust certain
    parties creates inefficiencies, conflicts, and failures. What unites Bitcoin and
    the distributed ledger platforms it inspired is a commitment to limiting the scope
    of that trust. Perversely, reducing the necessarily trust in some parts of a system
    may make the whole most trustworthy. Yet that is very different than saying that
    trust is absent. Just ask the customers of QuadrigaCX.

    the ether did not disappear. Anyone could still view the records identifying the
    currency on the Ethereum distributed ledger. Yet for the customers involved, it
    was as if a stack of $100 bills were locked in an impenetrable safe, with no key.^([14](#chapter6-14))
    If this were traditional money sitting in a vault or the electronic records of
    a bank, there would be no problem. The bank by definition would have custody over
    the funds. It would have the ability—even if it were reluctant or legally restrained
    in exercising it—to release the funds. But that is exactly the form of “relying
    on trust” that Satoshi negated.

    如果这是躺在金库中的传统货币，或者是一家银行的电子记录，那就不会有问题。银行按定义就有对这些资金的保管权。它会有能力——即使它犹豫不决或受到法律限制——释放这些资金。但这就正是中本聪所否定的“依赖信任”的形式。

    that made it impossible for QuadrigaCX to recover their funds once they are cryptographically
    locked away. This is the dark side of immutability. Banks and governments and
    others do not change transactions after the fact because they simply cannot. Where
    reliance on others is a cause for concern, this minimization of third-party trust
    makes participants more willing to transact. Perversely, though, that requires
    more trust on the part of participants. It is a leap of faith to engage in valuable

    edges of the ledgers. Even when value is encoded into decentralized systems, the
    access points may be through centralized edge services. For example, an individual
    who stores bitcoin with a consumer-oriented wallet service such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info,
    or Xapo must trust that provider in the same manner as with a bank. The wallet
    provider stores the private cryptographic keys for its customers, which allows
    them to access their cryptocurrency through a standard user name and password.
    However, if the wallet provider is hacked, the keys become vulnerable. The fact
    that the wallet is connected to a distributed ledger does not make the wallet
    service itself inherently more decentralized than a traditional web-based service,
    nor does it make the wallet itself any more secure. As Nick Szabo tweeted, “Bitcoin
    is the most secure financial network on the planet. But its centralized peripheral
    companies are among the most insecure.”^([47](#chapter6-47)) It is estimated that

    are wise leaders who can enforce decisions by changing the code, how is that any
    different than centralized development projects such as Linux, or Facebook for

- en: The response to Vili’s Paradox lies in examining the subtleties of distributed
    ledger adoption. To use Brian Behlendorf’s formulation, shifting the point of
    minimum viable centralization makes a difference, even when that point is nonzero.
    Again we return to the gap between what Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to create—a system
    that worked “without relying on trust”—and the more limited, yet actually more
    significant, reality. What Bitcoin actually eliminated was the need for trusted
    third-party validation of transactions, which is only one element of trust. Adam
    Ludwin, CEO of the blockchain technology firm Chain, made the same mistake with
    the admittedly pithy statement, “Cryptocurrencies do not *have* governance mechanisms,
    they *are* governance mechanisms.”^([4](#chapter7-4)) A more accurate statement
    is that cryptocurrency networks are technologies of governance.^([5](#chapter7-5))
    The blockchain decentralizes the rule-enforcement aspects, but not necessarily
    rule creation.

    arises from the interplay of internal and external rules.^([7](#chapter7-7)) If
    blockchain networks and Dapps were clearly subject to legal obligations, they

    While this could be the case, the fact that distributed ledgers can be employed
    to develop customized extralegal rule-sets for communities and organizations does
    not mean they will be. Given the experience of the past twenty years, the burden
    is on those arguing that the outcome will be different this time. It bears noting
    that while distributed ledgers based on Nakamoto Consensus are new, smart contracts
    and digital currencies are not. Nick Szabo described the mechanism for private
    regulation by smart contracts in the early 1990s. There has not, however, been
    widespread adoption of cryptographically based, private law.

    would do away with the anonymity of cash transactions. And tokenized systems to
    track personal information and associated metadata, even if decentralizing control
    to individuals, could radically centralize the availability of that data to governments
    and dominant private platforms. Describing this scenario, the technology critic

    of recorded records. And unlike many financial applications, fine-grained control

    the primary function of ether is to obtain the gas necessary for executing smart

    in a way that DAO token purchasers were not. Especially when Ethereum launched
    its crowdsale in 2014, well before the 2017 ICO gold rush, purchasers were not
    necessarily focused on profit. And the Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that

    reason that some ICO tokens are so highly valued is that, in addition to whatever
    utility they have within their platform, they can be traded for other cryptocurrencies
    or fiat. The option to cash out new tokens, however, depends on the willingness
    of exchanges to list them. Most cryptocurrency exchanges were not set up as regulated
    secondary markets in securities, and thus have strong incentives to avoid listing

    distributions, known as “airdrops,” raise no money at all; they are purely designed

    core business model, have colorable arguments that their primary goal is to create
    users rather than investors. The tokens are necessary for the operation of their
    networks. Users need to participate by spending the tokens or taking actions such
    as viewing ads and providing storage. Such coins, being predominantly based around
    utility, could be outside the *Howey* requirements. However, even if something
    is labeled a “utility token” and offers functionality on a software platform,
    it still constitutes a security if marketed primarily as a passive investment.
    The SEC made this clear in its enforcement action against the ICO of a restaurant
    review start-up called Munchee.^([32](#chapter9-32)) Munchee actively promoted
    the tokens based on potential price appreciation as adoption grew, rather than
    as a way to participate actively in the network. A good regulatory scheme would
    need to provide some guidance so that offerors understand the boundaries of the
    category.^([33](#chapter9-33)) And there would still be some baseline requirements,

    functional and prefunctional services. Companies can offer tokens before they
    operate an application that can accept them. Doing so can allow early-stage projects

    than through traditional angel and early-stage venture capital channels. As of
    October 2017, fewer than 10 percent of token networks with completed ICOs were

    issues. Having too much money up front can be a problem for start-ups because
    it encourages them to be profligate or to feel insufficient pressure to hit the
    next milestone. The ease of issuing tokens for prefunctional networks, and the

- en: Finally, regulators must always assess the consequences of their activities.
    This occurs more than technology innovators realize. In an environment of regulatory
    competition, regulators are aware that overly restrictive decisions can push activity
    to other jurisdictions. They have limited resources for enforcement action. And
    regulatory agencies want to align themselves with the forces of innovation. Nonetheless,
    when market developments are uncertain, as in the blockchain case, evaluating
    costs and benefits is often more of an art than a science.

  zh: 最后，监管机构必须始终评估其活动的后果。这一点比技术创新者意识到的要多。在监管竞争的环境中，监管机构知道过于严格的决策可能会推动活动转移到其他司法管辖区。他们的执法资源是有限的。监管机构希望与创新力量保持一致。尽管如此，当市场发展存在不确定性，如区块链案例所示，评估成本和收益往往更像是艺术而非科学。
- en: Regulators can choose where and when to intervene. Blockchain proponents who
    say that “the regulators can’t arrest everyone” neglect that there are pressure
    points at the edges of networks where regulators can focus their attention. Rather
    than attempt to shut down a network or a protocol, for example, they can focus
    on the onboarding points, which are typically centrally managed. So long as the
    operators of those edge services are responsible actors, there are opportunities
    to work with regulators.

- en: The SEC’s approach to securities-regulation questions around ICOs illustrates
    a careful balancing. The agency’s strategy of addressing The DAO first was as
    important as its substantive conclusions. The SEC knew that ICOs were opening
    the door for significant innovation and did not want to spook the market. It understood
    that the *Howey* dividing line would be difficult to apply to some projects. So
    it picked one that was not only a clear case, but already dead. The DAO already
    had returned all contributions after the hard fork and shut down. There was no
    need for the SEC to take any enforcement action. But its analysis could serve
    as a warning shot to the market, giving guidance for those uncertain about its
    views. Even as the agency began taking subsequent enforcement actions, its chair,
    Jay Carney, put out a statement emphasizing that “ICOs—whether they represent
    offerings of securities or not—can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others
    to raise funding, including for innovative projects.”^([54](#chapter9-54))

  zh: 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）针对ICO的证券监管问题的处理方式体现了谨慎的平衡。该机构针对The DAO首先采取行动的战略与其实质性结论一样重要。SEC知道ICO正在为重大创新打开大门，并且不想吓坏市场。它明白如何应用*Howey*标准对某些项目来说将是困难的。因此，它选择了一个不仅是一个明确的案例，而且还已经死亡的案例。The
    DAO在分叉后已经归还了所有贡献并关闭。SEC没有采取任何执法行动的必要。但其分析可以作为市场的警告，为那些对其观点不确定的人提供指导。即使该机构开始采取随后的执法行动，其主席Jay
    Carney也发表了一份声明，强调“ICO——无论它们是否代表证券的发行——可以是企业家和其他人筹集资金的有效方式，包括为创新项目筹集资金。”^([54](#chapter9-54))
- en: Going forward, the SEC and other regulators will need to take more active steps
    to address ICO activity and abuses. The SEC has formed a Cyber Unit dedicated
    to enforcement challenges around online activity, including ICO-related misconduct.^([55](#chapter9-55))
    In addition to informal conversations such as the one that led Protostarr to shut
    down, the SEC has already begun filing charges against unscrupulous ICO promoters.
    The most difficult questions will involve offerings like The DAO, where failure
    to register, rather than fraud, is the primary violation. Fraud involves clear
    harm and illegitimate conduct. An unregistered security might still be offered
    in a way that affords reasonable protections to investors and information to the
    market.

  zh: 展望未来，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）和其他监管机构需要采取更为积极的措施来解决首次代币发行（ICO）的活动和滥用问题。SEC已经成立了一个专注于网络活动，包括与ICO相关的违规行为的网络单位。除了像导致Protostarr关闭的非正式对话之外，SEC已经开始对不道德的ICO推广者提起诉讼。最棘手的问题将涉及类似于The
    DAO的代币发行，这里的主要违规行为是不注册，而不是欺诈。欺诈涉及明显的伤害和不正当行为。未经注册的证券可能仍以向投资者提供合理保护并让市场获取信息的方式发行。
- en: To address such challenges, regulators will need to calibrate their actions
    in the way that the FCC did with VOIP services. The agency knew that mindless
    application of its rules to ban all unregulated, Internet-based telephony would
    stifle innovation and prevent new competitive alternatives. Where it could, the
    FCC identified activities clearly outside its rules to eliminate uncertainty about
    future regulation.^([56](#chapter9-56)) On the other hand, where companies used
    the technology for regulatory arbitrage without any consumer benefits, it stepped
    in.^([57](#chapter9-57)) It handled policy issues individually, such as how to
    ensure that calls to 911 emergency services went through, to avoid unnecessary
    spillover effects. And when there were good reasons to apply the traditional rules
    to services using new technologies, it worked with those providers to help them
    comply.

  zh: 为应对这些挑战，监管机构需要像FCC对待VOIP服务那样调整其行动。该机构知道，如果不加区分地应用其规则禁止所有未受监管的基于互联网的电话服务，将会抑制创新并阻止新的竞争性替代方案的出现。在可能的情况下，FCC确定了其规则明确不适用的活动，以消除对未来监管的不确定性。^([56](#chapter9-56))
    另一方面，当公司使用该技术进行监管套利而没有给消费者带来任何好处时，它会介入。^([57](#chapter9-57)) 对于如何确保911紧急服务电话能顺利拨通等政策问题，它会逐一处理，以避免不必要的溢出效应。当有充分理由将传统规则应用于使用新技术的服务时，它会与这些提供商合作，帮助他们遵守规定。
- en: The SEC’s initial actions suggest that it intends to steer a similar course
    for ICOs. Other major securities regulators, such as the Singapore MAS, the Financial
    Market Supervisory Authority in Switzerland, and the Federal Financial Supervisory
    Authority in Germany, have indicated that they understand the need to tread carefully,
    but act when needed. One of the benefits of the global nature of ICOs is that
    regulators can compare notes. Effective approaches in one jurisdiction can be
    copied elsewhere. The biggest challenge is that this process will take time. Cryptocurrency
    projects that decided to issue tokens first and ask questions later may find themselves
    in a difficult spot. Where existing laws and regulations fail to offer an effective
    pathway, changing them may involve an agonizingly slow process for entrepreneurs
    caught up in the rush of cryptocurrency market development.

  zh: 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）最初的行动表明，它打算对ICO采取类似的路线。其他主要的证券监管机构，如新加坡金融管理局（MAS）、瑞士金融市场监督局（Financial
    Market Supervisory Authority）和德国联邦金融监管局（Federal Financial Supervisory Authority），已表示他们理解需要谨慎行事，但在必要时采取行动。ICO的全球性质的一个好处是，监管机构可以互通有无。一个司法管辖区有效的做法可以在其他地方复制。最大的挑战是这个过程需要时间。决定先发代币再问问题的加密货币项目可能会发现自己处于困境。当现有法律和规定无法提供有效的途径时，改变它们可能会让陷入加密货币市场发展热潮的创业者经历痛苦缓慢的过程。
- en: Nonetheless, governments will have to adapt if they wish their citizens to enjoy
    the benefits that distributed ledgers can bring. There are many important legal
    questions to resolve, just as there were for the Internet. Often, there will not
    be a single correct approach. The coming years will witness significant experimentation
    around both the business and the legal models for distributed-ledger systems.
    The measured pace of regulatory evolution is both a feature and a bug. Moving
    too quickly on the basis of developments that turn out to be passing fads can
    have costs as well. The greatest reason for optimism that regulatory concerns
    will be resolved is that while governments are not going away any time soon, neither
    is the blockchain.
