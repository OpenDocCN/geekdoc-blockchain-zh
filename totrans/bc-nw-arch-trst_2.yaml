    in individual actors such as banks or regulators. With the blockchain, by contrast,
    no distinct party—not miners, those running blockchain nodes, creators of the

    accurate copy of the blockchain; there are no administrative nodes or hierarchical
    relationships.^([4](#chapter5-4)) Everyone has access to the same software. So
    long as they do not control a majority of the mining power, no untrustworthy actor

    are on the network, however, no one has the power to alter or control the ledger.
    There are still multiple nodes negotiating consensus, rather than having a master

    to trust the output of a system without necessarily trusting any of its individual
    components. Normally, these two go together. You would not trust a bicycle to
    carry you safely if you could not trust the integrity of the wheels and the brakes.
    The problem is that assessing the trustworthiness of components is costly and
    often impossible. How confident are you in the security of the encryption that
    your bank uses to move money from your checking account to a merchant? Are you

    evaluate the hygiene procedures of the slaughterhouse because you trust the meat
    company and government regulators to do that for you.

    responsibly. The same might be true if the slaughterhouse did its job, but the
    butcher at the market did not. What if a few untrustworthy actors did not necessarily
    undermine the trust of the system as a whole? It would be as if the slaughterhouse
    allowed the meat to become contaminated, but the market automatically rejected
    it. The blockchain trust architecture seeks to produce just such a result. Users
    can be confident about transactions without having confidence in the counterparty
    or any intermediaries.

    resend missing packets so quickly that no one notices. Eliminating the need for
    centralized trust in traffic delivery meant that every new system could focus
    on its own services without depending on or seeking approval from someone else.^([5](#chapter5-5))

    argument, as well as Robert Putnam’s research on social capital, is that societies
    vary (between themselves and over time) on the strength of trust relationships
    they support. High-trust societies develop powerful private firms and government

    that the traditional solution of “security through obscurity” is often misguided
    and can be replaced with security through structured transparency. Most of the
    critical software programs underpinning the Internet, including the Linux operating
    system and Apache web server, are open source. More developers having access to
    the source code means that more people can identify bugs. Similarly, security
    flaws are easier to spot when code is out in the open. With effective cryptography,
    even if the formula used to encode information is known, it cannot be decoded
    easily without possession of the key. With public key cryptography, moreover,
    the public key can be distributed because it reveals nothing without possession
    of the secret private key.

    is not new. Public companies are required to report detailed information about
    their financial performance every quarter, as well as any events that investors
    would consider material at any time. They are also required to submit to regular
    audits by independent firms. This auditing is designed to ensure that the information
    that firms report is accurate and that the conclusions they draw about their performance
    match the underlying reality. It is an imperfect process. Cases such as Enron
    and Worldcom show how auditing can fail, especially when the auditors’ incentives
    are misaligned with investors’. As cryptoeconomic systems, distributed ledger
    platforms are structured to align incentives with trustworthiness.

    to the user or the application. As a result, most permissioned blockchains do
    away with Bitcoin’s transparent ledger. They tend to be established by organizations

    debate. The right balance is likely to vary by application. It is also possible
    to have multiple levels of transparency in the same network. One approach is to
    allow audit nodes, which have deep visibility but no ability to initiate transactions.
    Corporate auditors today expend a great deal of effort obtaining access to books
    and records for their reports, but these generally give them only a retrospective
    view. Government regulators are another group that would value having real-time
    audit visibility into transaction networks. Central banks and other financial
    regulators, for example, could use audit nodes in a blockchain network to evaluate
    systemic risk. This bird’s-eye regulators’ perspective could be securely separated
    from the ground-level visibility available to market participants. Different networks

    protocol itself.”^([32](#chapter5-32)) Subjective systems require some additional
    knowledge. That has to come from somewhere—typically a central authority. Both
    systems in Buterin’s model use cryptoeconomic security. With smart contracts,

    and illegitimate transactions in a way that an objective one could not. As Buterin
    notes, “Concepts like manipulation, takeovers, and deceit, not detectable or in
    some cases even definable in pure cryptography, can be understood by the human
    community surrounding the protocol just fine.” Buterin highlighted the distinction

    example built into Bitcoin is multisig, short for “multiple signatures.” In a
    basic Bitcoin transaction, the recipient of the currency must provide his or her
    private key to receive the funds. Multisig allows the sender to specify that some
    fraction of a larger number of keys is required. The most common multisig arrangement
    requires two of three keys. This allows a simple arbitration process. If both
    parties agree, their keys are sufficient to consummate the transaction. If they
    disagree, the holder of the third key breaks the tie. That third key-holder would
    typically be a neutral party selected in advance of such a situation. Multisig
    thus allows the blockchain to connect with human-based trust because an arbitrator
    can break the tie between adversarial parties.

    on trust,” he actually meant something much narrower. Electronic transactions
    in bitcoin can be trusted as valid without a discrete trustworthy third party,
    such as a government or bank, to verify them. That is indeed a dramatic change.
    There are a surprising number of situations in which the need to trust certain
    parties creates inefficiencies, conflicts, and failures. What unites Bitcoin and
    the distributed ledger platforms it inspired is a commitment to limiting the scope
    of that trust. Perversely, reducing the necessarily trust in some parts of a system
    may make the whole most trustworthy. Yet that is very different than saying that
    trust is absent. Just ask the customers of QuadrigaCX.

    currency on the Ethereum distributed ledger. Yet for the customers involved, it
    was as if a stack of $100 bills were locked in an impenetrable safe, with no key.^([14](#chapter6-14))
    If this were traditional money sitting in a vault or the electronic records of
    a bank, there would be no problem. The bank by definition would have custody over
    the funds. It would have the ability—even if it were reluctant or legally restrained
    in exercising it—to release the funds. But that is exactly the form of “relying
    on trust” that Satoshi negated.

    locked away. This is the dark side of immutability. Banks and governments and
    others do not change transactions after the fact because they simply cannot. Where
    reliance on others is a cause for concern, this minimization of third-party trust
    makes participants more willing to transact. Perversely, though, that requires
    more trust on the part of participants. It is a leap of faith to engage in valuable

    specialized hardware that was optimized for Bitcoin’s hashing puzzles. Ultimately,

    circuits (ASICs), to power massive racks of mining computers. The performance
    of these ASICs was so much greater than the alternatives that for all intents
    and purposes, mining became a scale game. Operators such as Bitmain and Bitfury

    a block, pools split their payouts in proportion to the hashing power contributed.
    This made payouts steadier and more predictable, further accelerating the commercialization
    of mining. The fact that ASIC developers could outsource some of their hardware

    provider stores the private cryptographic keys for its customers, which allows
    them to access their cryptocurrency through a standard user name and password.
    However, if the wallet provider is hacked, the keys become vulnerable. The fact
    that the wallet is connected to a distributed ledger does not make the wallet
    service itself inherently more decentralized than a traditional web-based service,
    nor does it make the wallet itself any more secure. As Nick Szabo tweeted, “Bitcoin
    is the most secure financial network on the planet. But its centralized peripheral
    companies are among the most insecure.”^([47](#chapter6-47)) It is estimated that
    10 percent of the ether raised in ICOs has already been stolen, mostly from wallets.^([48](#chapter6-48))

    so at some point, they have to buy their bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies with
    existing currency. A number of exchanges have sprung up around the world to serve
    this need. They also allow institutional traders to create markets. Well-functioning

    If the payment is in bitcoin, there is no one involved in the payment itself to
    pressure, just a distributed network of miners. If, however, the transaction goes
    through an edge provider, it can be subjected to legal enforcement. That might

    of virtual worlds and the gig economy. He cowrote the definitive book on virtual
    economies. A *New Yorker* article even flagged him as a potential Satoshi Nakamoto.^([1](#chapter7-1))

    If they truly have no means of collectively resolving disputes other than voluntary
    agreement, they will fail. On the other hand, Lehdonvirta asserts, when these
    networks adopt formal or informal governance structures, they are no longer truly
    decentralized. If Ethereum succeeds because Vitalik Buterin and its core developers
    are wise leaders who can enforce decisions by changing the code, how is that any
    different than centralized development projects such as Linux, or Facebook for
    that matter? At that point, the advantages of decentralization, which must be
    weighed against the overheads it imposes, disappear. With governance, Lehdonvirta
    suggests, there is no longer decentralization. But with decentralization at any
    interesting scale, there must be governance. Hence the paradox.

    Again we return to the gap between what Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to create—a system
    that worked “without relying on trust”—and the more limited, yet actually more
    significant, reality. What Bitcoin actually eliminated was the need for trusted
    third-party validation of transactions, which is only one element of trust. Adam
    Ludwin, CEO of the blockchain technology firm Chain, made the same mistake with
    the admittedly pithy statement, “Cryptocurrencies do not *have* governance mechanisms,
    they *are* governance mechanisms.”^([4](#chapter7-4)) A more accurate statement

    significance later, as the block rewards decreased. In practice, however, transaction
    fees scaled up more quickly. The growing level of traffic overwhelmed the Bitcoin
    network. Those who wanted their transactions to be processed in a reasonable amount
    of time were forced to tack on larger and larger transaction fees to move to the
    head of the queue. By 2017, Bitcoin transaction fees routinely were several dollars

    to move fast, others to change slowly over time. The faction opposed to increasing
    the block size eventually coalesced around a technical upgrade called “segregated
    witness (Segwit),” which would process blocks more efficiently. It also made possible
    a feature called Lightning, allowing some transactions to be processed off the

    not being captured by one particular group’s agenda, and they can be confident

    of Bitcoin. But they rarely became big enough to dent the legitimate, regulated
    markets. And when they did, as with the Megaupload file locker service run by

    Distributed ledger systems enforce decisions based on the difficulty of reversing
    cryptographic mathematical transformations. In the place of markets is self-interest,
    or what economists would call “incentives.” Many of the relevant decisions, such
    as whether to contribute computing power to mining a cryptocurrency or which chain
    to follow after a fork, do not involve market transactions. Moreover, the term
    “self-interest” captures the surprising aspect of Nakamoto Consensus—namely, that
    miners’ single-minded greed can contribute to the public good of a trusted shared
    ledger.

    that is by nature external to blockchain software, networks, and communities because
    it comes from governmental actors. These “New New Chicago School” categories for
    blockchain systems can be organized along two axes: whether they are expressed
    in formal mathematical terms or in human language, and whether they describe a
    system of rules or an expression of human motivation.'

    key is mathematically connected to a certain public key, but one cannot be determined
    from the other without expending unrealistic levels of computing power. A hash
    function proves that someone had a particular document, even if the document itself
    cannot be reconstructed from the hash. When built into a software system such

    Formal systems are neat and precise. They seem to do away with the ambiguities

    law. Although it is expressed in terms designed to be read by humans rather than
    machines, law is also a structure of rules that define the scope of possible behavior.
    Where cryptography rests on the deep symphony of mathematics, law rests on the
    power of institutions and processes. Similarly, trust is not something that can
    be stated in precise economic terms. It is a leap of faith. Without that leap,
    society as we know it could not thrive. As humans, we are somehow driven to trust
    each other, just as we are driven to maximize our personal welfare. Even when

    relationship. A promise lacking the required attributes of contract law may still
    be sufficient to engender trust, even though it is not enforceable. Conversely,
    untrusting enemies may enter into legally binding transactions if they see a mutual

    ways. The legal system provides redress for violations of agreements, which may
    give the parties additional confidence when entering those relationships. This
    was essentially Thomas Hobbes’s argument in *Leviathan*. Legal enforcement is
    not perfect, but trust necessarily involves some risk. The legal enforcement mechanism
    may reduce the possibility and magnitude of loss from untrustworthiness enough
    to induce trust-based relationships. Moreover, law formalizes relationships. Knowing
    the scope of expectations on both sides, as well as placing the entire arrangement
    within a structure, can limit misunderstandings. Thus, even though legal enforcement
    rests on the Leviathan of state power, law may create necessary space for the
    informal arrangements of P2P trust. In the formulation from chapter 1 of trust
    as confident vulnerability, the prospect of legal redress makes the actor feel
    less vulnerable, thus expanding her or his confidence to interact.

    sometimes going back over a century. They list conveyances of the property between
    owners in sequence. Like the blockchain, records can only be added, not changed

    involving cryptocurrencies and distributed ledgers: illegality, validity, and
    classification. The first involves using cryptocurrencies to break the law, or
    theft of cryptocurrencies through hacking and similar means. The fact that bitcoin
    can be used to pay for drugs does not by itself raise legal problems for the cryptocurrency;
    Chinese yuan, dollars, or bars of gold can do the same. The challenge is that
    a private, decentralized currency that is pseudonymous or anonymous makes it easier
    to engage in such illegal activity without consequence. Contrary to fears, no
    major Western government has attempted to ban the possession or use of cryptocurrencies
    on this basis. Those that did tended to be smaller nations such as Bolivia and
    Bangladesh. Even countries such as China that now bar bitcoin trading do not make
    the possession and use of cryptocurrencies illegal.'

    Vlad’s Conundrum is that the same code that makes it difficult to engage in censorship
    or tampering also makes it easier to engage in drug trafficking or ransomware.
    A related concern is that blockchain technology, by creating decentralized digital
    bearer instruments, creates an attractive target for thieves. These two problems,
    typified in Silk Road and Mt. Gox respectively, were the most prominent legal
    questions during the early years of Bitcoin prior to 2015\. They remain significant
    today, with newer dark marketplaces for illegal transactions springing up and
    major ransomware attacks demanding contributions in bitcoin.

    Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece four years later at the request of U.S.
    authorities. As these examples show, the global scale of blockchain networks does
    not prevent nations from enforcing their laws. Coordination among law enforcement
    and mechanisms such as extradition can be used to bring criminals to justice.
    And courts in major countries like the United States have little difficulty applying
    conventional doctrines of jurisdiction in order to exert their authority when
    the interests of their citizens are implicated.^([13](#chapter9-13)) The Federal
    District Court in New York rejected arguments by Arthur Budovsky, who founded
    a pre-Bitcoin digital currency provider called Liberty Reserve, that it was not

    services called “tumblers,” as well as anonymous cryptocurrencies such as ZCash
    and Monero, in order to avoid being tracked. Analytics technology is evolving
    as well. Most of the time, however, such measures are unnecessary. Users generally
    obtain and hold cryptocurrencies through wallet applications that require anti-money
    laundering/know your customer (AML/KYC) checks upon sign-up. Those that do not,

    usually definitional. There is no formal definition of what counts as a blockchain,
    cryptocurrency, distributed ledger, or smart contract. Industry groups such as
    the Chamber of Digital Commerce and organizations such as the Uniform Law Commission,
    a group of experts that proposes model laws to state legislatures, are working
    on proposed definitions, but the proper formulation will vary depending on the
    circumstances. The attributes that make a corporate record valid on a blockchain
    are different from those relevant for evidence in court. For example, the Delaware
    legislation does not mention blockchains at all, referring simply to “distributed
    electronic networks or databases.”^([19](#chapter9-19)) There are so many legal

    This automatically preempted state laws requiring paper signatures, removing the
    need to change them case by case. It left open the question of whether a digital
    signature was enforceable in any specific case by requiring only that the electronic
    form could not be the sole reason for invalidation. Thus, some electronic signatures
    must be cryptographically secured, while in other cases, typing one’s initials
    on an electronic form is sufficient. This matches the variation with physical
    signatures. Some documents can just be signed with the parties’ initials, while
    others require witnesses, notaries, and other formalities.

    were essentially relying on the managerial activities of Slock.it, the software
    developer. Its employees wrote the code, oversaw the operations of the system,

    Ethereum also launched by selling tokens that appreciated in value. The agency

    classification in the future. A key distinction is likely that ether has significant
    utility above and beyond being a way to invest in the success of the Ethereum
    Foundation’s efforts. Just as the primary function of bitcoin is to buy things,
    the primary function of ether is to obtain the gas necessary for executing smart
    contracts. Ether purchasers are active contributors to the success of the enterprise
    in a way that DAO token purchasers were not. Especially when Ethereum launched
    its crowdsale in 2014, well before the 2017 ICO gold rush, purchasers were not
    necessarily focused on profit. And the Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that

    utility they have within their platform, they can be traded for other cryptocurrencies
    or fiat. The option to cash out new tokens, however, depends on the willingness
    of exchanges to list them. Most cryptocurrency exchanges were not set up as regulated
    secondary markets in securities, and thus have strong incentives to avoid listing

    of securities regulation is no less relevant when the asset being sold is a token
    than when it is a stock. On the other hand, ICOs do not *necessarily* operate
    like securities. They can be structured in many different ways, and their appeal
    to purchasers varies based on the nature of the system in question. Some token
    distributions, known as “airdrops,” raise no money at all; they are purely designed
    to get tokens into the hands of users.^([31](#chapter9-31)) And many projects

    on the application platform, and whether the project is operational at the time

    thought leaders about how token offerings overcome the barriers to decentralized
    innovation, most of the conversation around ICOs among both offerors and purchasers
    centers on making money. To the general public, token sales are a hot new investment

    core business model, have colorable arguments that their primary goal is to create
    users rather than investors. The tokens are necessary for the operation of their
    networks. Users need to participate by spending the tokens or taking actions such
    as viewing ads and providing storage. Such coins, being predominantly based around
    utility, could be outside the *Howey* requirements. However, even if something
    is labeled a “utility token” and offers functionality on a software platform,
    it still constitutes a security if marketed primarily as a passive investment.
    The SEC made this clear in its enforcement action against the ICO of a restaurant
    review start-up called Munchee.^([32](#chapter9-32)) Munchee actively promoted
    the tokens based on potential price appreciation as adoption grew, rather than
    as a way to participate actively in the network. A good regulatory scheme would
    need to provide some guidance so that offerors understand the boundaries of the
    category.^([33](#chapter9-33)) And there would still be some baseline requirements,
    even for unregistered utility coins. Fraud is fraud.

    operate an application that can accept them. Doing so can allow early-stage projects
    to gain needed funding for software development, and to raise capital more easily
    than through traditional angel and early-stage venture capital channels. As of
    October 2017, fewer than 10 percent of token networks with completed ICOs were
    operational.^([34](#chapter9-34)) This is both a blessing and a curse. Ethereum

    issues. Having too much money up front can be a problem for start-ups because
    it encourages them to be profligate or to feel insufficient pressure to hit the
    next milestone. The ease of issuing tokens for prefunctional networks, and the
    associated market frenzy, has also invited arrangements in which institutional

    tokens at a discount, giving them a structural advantage over retail investors.

    regulators’ concerns. We will examine some of these in chapter 10\. There will

    on a Swiss foundation, the IGF is developing a standard registration form for
    ICOs, a registration database for investors, and certification of custodial organizations
    to handle funds contributed to ICOs. The registration form would provide the kind
    of information about how projects are structured and how funds will be used that
    appears in government-required filings such as the SEC’s S-1 for initial public
    offerings (IPOs). It would be designed as a schema for online submission, allowing
    easy search and analysis.

    for legal compliance in relevant jurisdictions. However, the group is looking
    to work with regulators to establish best practices and standards. If it can establish
    a good track record, investors may come to value token sales that go through the
    IGF process in more detail. And the IGF is not alone. For example, Cameron and
    Tyler Winklevoss, major early bitcoin investors who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency
    exchange, have proposed the Virtual Currency Association (VCA) as a self-regulatory
    body to police trading of cryptocurrencies once they are issued.^([53](#chapter9-53))

    most notably the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for broker-dealers
    and the National Futures Association (NFA) for futures traders, can oversee compliance
    with legal and ethical standards. Organizations along the lines of the IGF and
    the VCA might provide a bridge between regulators and the private sector. A number
    of other self-regulatory initiatives have been floated to address concerns associated
    with ICOs.

    series of conversations between and among regulators and the private sector. Both
    sides will need to view the regulatory toolkit broadly to find the best solutions
    for the novel challenges that cryptocurrencies raise.

    This occurs more than technology innovators realize. In an environment of regulatory
    competition, regulators are aware that overly restrictive decisions can push activity
    to other jurisdictions. They have limited resources for enforcement action. And
    regulatory agencies want to align themselves with the forces of innovation. Nonetheless,
    when market developments are uncertain, as in the blockchain case, evaluating
    costs and benefits is often more of an art than a science.

    say that “the regulators can’t arrest everyone” neglect that there are pressure
    points at the edges of networks where regulators can focus their attention. Rather
    than attempt to shut down a network or a protocol, for example, they can focus
    on the onboarding points, which are typically centrally managed. So long as the
    operators of those edge services are responsible actors, there are opportunities
    to work with regulators.

- en: The SEC’s approach to securities-regulation questions around ICOs illustrates
    a careful balancing. The agency’s strategy of addressing The DAO first was as
    important as its substantive conclusions. The SEC knew that ICOs were opening
    the door for significant innovation and did not want to spook the market. It understood
    that the *Howey* dividing line would be difficult to apply to some projects. So
    it picked one that was not only a clear case, but already dead. The DAO already
    had returned all contributions after the hard fork and shut down. There was no
    need for the SEC to take any enforcement action. But its analysis could serve
    as a warning shot to the market, giving guidance for those uncertain about its
    views. Even as the agency began taking subsequent enforcement actions, its chair,
    Jay Carney, put out a statement emphasizing that “ICOs—whether they represent
    offerings of securities or not—can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others
    to raise funding, including for innovative projects.”^([54](#chapter9-54))

    to address ICO activity and abuses. The SEC has formed a Cyber Unit dedicated
    to enforcement challenges around online activity, including ICO-related misconduct.^([55](#chapter9-55))
    In addition to informal conversations such as the one that led Protostarr to shut
    down, the SEC has already begun filing charges against unscrupulous ICO promoters.
    The most difficult questions will involve offerings like The DAO, where failure
    to register, rather than fraud, is the primary violation. Fraud involves clear
    harm and illegitimate conduct. An unregistered security might still be offered
    in a way that affords reasonable protections to investors and information to the
    market.

    in the way that the FCC did with VOIP services. The agency knew that mindless
    application of its rules to ban all unregulated, Internet-based telephony would
    stifle innovation and prevent new competitive alternatives. Where it could, the
    FCC identified activities clearly outside its rules to eliminate uncertainty about
    future regulation.^([56](#chapter9-56)) On the other hand, where companies used
    the technology for regulatory arbitrage without any consumer benefits, it stepped
    in.^([57](#chapter9-57)) It handled policy issues individually, such as how to
    ensure that calls to 911 emergency services went through, to avoid unnecessary
    spillover effects. And when there were good reasons to apply the traditional rules
    to services using new technologies, it worked with those providers to help them
    comply.

- en: The SEC’s initial actions suggest that it intends to steer a similar course
    for ICOs. Other major securities regulators, such as the Singapore MAS, the Financial
    Market Supervisory Authority in Switzerland, and the Federal Financial Supervisory
    Authority in Germany, have indicated that they understand the need to tread carefully,
    but act when needed. One of the benefits of the global nature of ICOs is that
    regulators can compare notes. Effective approaches in one jurisdiction can be
    copied elsewhere. The biggest challenge is that this process will take time. Cryptocurrency
    projects that decided to issue tokens first and ask questions later may find themselves
    in a difficult spot. Where existing laws and regulations fail to offer an effective
    pathway, changing them may involve an agonizingly slow process for entrepreneurs
    caught up in the rush of cryptocurrency market development.

    the benefits that distributed ledgers can bring. There are many important legal
    questions to resolve, just as there were for the Internet. Often, there will not
    be a single correct approach. The coming years will witness significant experimentation
    around both the business and the legal models for distributed-ledger systems.
    The measured pace of regulatory evolution is both a feature and a bug. Moving
    too quickly on the basis of developments that turn out to be passing fads can
    have costs as well. The greatest reason for optimism that regulatory concerns
    will be resolved is that while governments are not going away any time soon, neither
    is the blockchain.
