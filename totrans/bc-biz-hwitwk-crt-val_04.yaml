    data and your application, everyone can access to open financial system, open
    access infrastructure, no company or person have control. It is a programmable
    blockchain which means the developer can be used to build a new application. Bitcoin
    blockchain is the mother of all blockchains. It was intended for peer-to-peer
    transfer of values. The framework of code execution was introduced by Ethereum
    forums. The center place and thrust of the Ethereum blockchain is smart contractors.
    Ethereum has a decentralized application which has benefit of cryptocurrency and
    blockchain. The Ethereum set of rules are simple and practical, even at the amount
    of some data storage or time eﬃcient. A common programmer needs to preferably
    be capable to follow and implement the specification, in that way to entirely
    understand the unequal democratizing ability that cryptocurrency brings and further
    the imaginative and prescient of Ethereum has a protocol that is accessible to
    ever user. Any development which provides complexity should not be blanketed unless
    that development leads to great benefit.

    a scripting language for application development. He suggested to develop a new
    platform with a more general scripting language. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey
