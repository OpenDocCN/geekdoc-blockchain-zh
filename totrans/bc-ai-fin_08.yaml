    intelligence is clearly a disruptive  and potentially disruptive technology tool,
    but it is important to take a step back and observe the overall business environment
    in addition to the finance and accounting specific applications that have entered
    the marketplace. Drilling down, and taking a realistic analysis of where both
    personnel and technology tools are currently positioned in the marketplace it
    may be logical to conclude that implementing an artificial intelligence platform
    may not be a practical option at this time. Additionally, and dealing with the
    reality that some individuals will be less engaged in the technological process
    than others within the organization, RPA offers several benefits that a fully
    fledged blockchain or artificial intelligence may not be able deliver at the present
    time (Fig [7.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_7_Chapter/467992_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_7_Chapter/467992_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png)

    that are offering RPA and other automation solutions that are tested, business
    proven, and have been adopted by other firms (Seasongood [2016](#CR10)). This
    differs from other ideas and concepts, such as AI and blockchain, which although
    may ultimately offer more promise and upside, still remain within pilot or beta
    phases, generating a platform to achieve additional buy-in. Being able to deliver
    a viable product that, for lack of a better phrase of mindset, can be thought
    of as a “plug and play” model instead of a radical implementation or adjustment
    of current technology solutions also makes the process of RPA implementation simpler
    in terms of coordinating with existing systems. The importance, especially as
    the whirlwind of technology tools and options continues to escalate and increase
    in intensity, of identifying realistic solutions and products that can be utilized
    and implemented both currently and moving forward is important for financial professionals
    seeking to occupy and drive strategic planning moving forward.

    an opportunity for the construction of a technology and data analysis plan; not
    just artificial intelligence or blockchain, but a comprehensive solution. Not
    every situation or problem will be equally addressed by emerging technologies
    and innovative solutions, but it is important to put together a plan and strategy
    to integrate emerging technologies alongside current tools and options to improve
    the decision making process (Preimesberger [2018](#CR7)). Linking back to the
    role of the decision making process itself, taking into account the importance
    of data, verifying said information, and generating insights off of this data
    forms the basis for how decisions and options can, and should be, evaluated. Evaluating
    these choices, however, is as equally important for the decision making as the
    ultimate choice mad as a result of these options. RPA offers a practical tactic
    and solution for the analysis and reporting of information that is increasingly
    becoming imperative in a digitized environment. As ever larger amounts of data
    and information are digitized, stored digitally, and transmitted through networks
    connecting the organization to both stakeholders internal and external.

    at the organization in any case, regardless of technology implementation or adoption  .
    This point is especially important to emphasize and highlight, especially as the
    pace and variety of technology tools and platforms continues to expand, evolve,
    and become increasingly important for financial professionals. At the end of the
    day, however, merely slapping a technology tool or purported solution on top of
    processes that are flawed will not result in any substantive improvement. Rather,
    the flaws and shortcomings already present in those processes will only be exacerbated
    and accelerated by the speed with which they are, augmented by technology, able
    to be completed and verified. As this book shifts from Part I, an overview and
    analysis of technology tools themselves to Part II: implications and applications
    for financial services, this seems like an appropriate time to revisit some of
    the key items and processes that should be underway to facilitate the implementation
    of technology solutions.'

    space, regardless of industry affiliation, is that processes are not properly
    identified nor classified within appropriate categories especially for automation
    purposes. It is important to remember that technology in and of itself will not
    improve processes, entries, or procedures currently employed at the organization,
    but will only amplify what is currently there. Creating a classification system
    for different types of entries, reports, and other outputs is an important first
    step for any technology implementation. Not doing so, as temping as that may seem –
    in the name of simply getting started – creating a framework is an essential first
    step.

    and imagine the steps you would take to do so. If asked, the process would probably
    be something like “first I spread the peanut butter on the bread, spread the jelly
    on the other piece, and put them together.” But is that really a realistic and

    complicated, in terms of automation and automating processes, than it might appear
    to an individual. While this example may seem slightly silly it does illustrate
    the following point; automating processes requires that every step in that process
    are understood, documented, and applied consistently across the organization.
    It is also important to always remember that this is not a theoretical conversation,
    or an academic debate that can be relegated to offline conversations. The digitization
    and automation of accounting processes is already here and only accelerating on
    a global basis.

- en: This is not a sales pitch book; no products are listed as recommended solutions
    nor are any service providers highlighted as superior to others. Continuing this
    theme, but acknowledging the reality that there are any going to be questions
    about the implementation of different technology solutions, it does appear appropriate
    to emphasize one salient point. Compared with artificial intelligence or blockchain
    solutions in the marketplace, which may or may not have succeeded as planned,
    RPA is a mature marketplace with organizations generating billions in market value
    over the last 15–20 years (Gex and Minor [2019](#CR5)). Different products and
    services will clearly be better fits for different organizations, both internally
    and on a client consultative basis, but the underlying point remains unchanged.
    RPA solutions and products are already available in the marketplace, and should
    certainly be a part of the technology conversation. Taking another approach may
    also assist in conversations held in the fast moving and fast changing technology
    landscape should focus on connecting RPA to more sophisticated technology options.
    In the scope of automation and digitization, RPA can be thought of as the foundational
    platform and application that can, and should, lead to more sophisticated and
    advanced solutions (Alarcon [2019](#CR1)). Building this bridge, and connecting
    current solutions and products to the potential of other solutions that may emerge
    over time also represents an additional tactic to help achieve management support
    and buy-in.

    platforms it is inevitable that there will be questions, issues, and obstacles
    that come up along the way. This is the norm, and should be considered something
    to be avoided or a sign of failure in the adoption process. Rather, it should
    be perceived and seen as an eventual part of the learning and onboarding process
    that accompanies the technology adoption and processing curve within any organization
    (Jones [2017](#CR6)). Integrating automation into current processes, organizing
    processes into buckets to facilitate the automation process, and taking into account
    the various stages of documentation all form parts of the decision making process
    that should be considered.

    you may have very well had with colleagues and clients, that AI is still in nascent
    stages, the reality of the situation is more complicated (Casale [2014](#CR3)).
    Although kickstarted with the partnership between KPMG and IBM Watson in 2016,
    which did deservedly capture the attention of market participants, the aftermath
    of that has resulted in lower levels of media coverage and analysis. This quieter
    media landscape, however, has masked a definitive shift toward how organizations
    are using AI and the speed with which this adoption has already occurred. Drilling
    down specifically, the pace of adoption is only moving one direction; forward.
    The specifics of the tools themselves, and the applications leveraged and enhanced
    by technology tools such as AI and blockchain will differ, but assuming that these
    tools will only have an impact sometimes in the future is a breach both of fiduciary
    and shows a lack of awareness connected to market actors. The implications of
    these tools will be clear going forward, but an important point to remember is
    that management professionals will not need to, overnight, become technical or
    coding experts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What management professionals will have to do, however, is be able to analysis,
    interpret, and understand both how these game changing technologies operate as
    well as what these technology tools mean for organizations and data management.
    It may seem intimidating, especially at first, for management professionals already
    juggling a variety of needs and expectations, to learn about these emerging technologies,
    but it is something that will only become more important moving forward (Brazina
    and Ugras [2018](#CR2)). Whether it involves enrolling in a certificate program,
    enrolling in employer sponsored corporate training and education, or re-enrolling
    in a graduate or executive education program the necessity for continuous learning
    and education is apparent. Management professionals, including working in the
    financial services areas, will – despite whatever levels of education and training
    have already been covered – need to adopt a mindset of ongoing learning.

- en: Another key point that all professionals, including those working in the financial
    services profession, will have to acknowledge and integrate into business operations
    moving forward, is the reality that many current jobs will no longer exist in
    3, 5, or 10 years. Virtually every large professional association, including those
    associated with the accounting, finance, investing, and trading market subsets
    have leadership teams that have acknowledged that these changes are coming (Samuels
    [2019](#CR8)). AI adoption  and implementation, for the time being, has primarily
    been adopted and implemented by the largest firms the marketplace, but that is
    merely the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Clearly, new tools and technology will
    first be introduced at the organizations that have the personnel and financial
    resources to put these processes into place, but it is logical to project a similar
    adoption curve to other technology tools. Desktop computers, laptops, wireless
    internet, and smartphones/tablets all began workplace implementation at larger
    organizations and since have been adopted at organizations at different levels
    of size and complexity.

    alongside such phrases as innovation, creativity, and thought leadership, but
    in the case of AI and blockchain disruption does appear to be an appropriate adjective.
    At the core of these ideas, the dual technology wave of blockchain and AI appear
    to have the ability to fundamentally change how financial services professionals
    interact with each other and with clients (Corson [2016](#CR4)). The phrase creative
    destruction may not offer much comfort to practitioners and organizations who
    find themselves upended or undercut by competitors leveraging these new tools,
    but this same change will offer opportunities for proactive professionals. As
    certain tasks are automated, outsources, or relegated to the dustbin, professionals
    must be able to identify, articulate, and operationalize some of the newer opportunities
    created by these processes.

    and examines what is most likely a more applicable and practical tool for professionals
    looking to automation parts or entire segments; robotic process automation. This
    may sound like an abstract or technical idea, but from a real world point of view
    it is probably more realistic for organizations and individuals to begin an automation
    journey from this point versus attempting a full blown artificial intelligence
    implementation. Often discussed alongside topics that include, but are not limited
    to, artificial intelligence, RPA is not similar or exactly the same as AI. From
    a practical and implementation perspective, this subset of automation technology
    might seem to be a more logical step and technology to begin adoption and implementation
    with as automation becomes increasingly integrated into the business decision
    making process. Robotic process automation may bring to mind images and feelings
    of automation, job losses, and other potentially anxiety inducing concepts, but
    that is only part of the story. Standing apart from a bull blown AI implementation
    project or attempt, RPA software tools and platforms are both more mature as well
    as having the ability to be onboard alongside existing technology platforms and
    systems.
