- en: A blockchain is a global decentralized ledger technology consisting of a growing
    block list. These time-stamped, append-only blocks are linked together using cryptography.
    The data in the blocks are permanent, immutable, and impossible to tamper with.
    In the blockchain, anyone can carry out transactions directly and exchange any
    asset of value with another person without the need for middlemen. The blockchain
    establishes an alternative trust mechanism between two participants and enables
    a new era of Internet usage called the Internet of Value (IoV). In the IoV, digital
    assets can be exchanged with another person instantly in an automated, secure,
    and decentralized manner—from stocks to arts, medicine, intellectual property,
    and more. On today’s Internet, we can freely share information. Tomorrow, we will
    freely share value in the blockchain. Blockchain as a revolutionary technology
    is a marching phenomenon that will gradually impact business and reshape the world
    economy. Every industry, including finance, healthcare, education, real estate,
    and supply chain, could potentially be revolutionized with the help of blockchain
    technology.

    business activities that transform raw materials and components into a finished
    product and deliver it to the consumer. The entities involved in a supply chain
    include producers, vendors, wholesalers, transportation carriers, distribution
    centers, retailers, and customers.

- en: A traditional supply chain flow follows a linear, step-by-step progression,
    including planning, designing, sourcing the raw materials, product development,
    marketing, operations, distribution, finance, and customer service. The current
    step typically depends on the input of the previous step. Effective supply chain
    management can reduce a company’s overall costs and accelerate its production
    cycle. If any stage breaks, the entire linear chain will be disrupted, which can
    be costly. Currently, a supply chain oversees and integrates all the activities,
    including ordering, purchasing, manufacturing, transportation, and distribution,
    into a centralized platform.

    documents could include purchase orders, customs paperwork, inspection reports,
    dealer/distributor agreements, manufacturer and product information, and the location
