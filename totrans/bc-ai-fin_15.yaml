    tokenUtility tokenSome of the most high profile work that has taken place, especially
    as it pertains to the accounting subset of the financial services landscape, is
    the work that has taken place linked to audit and attestation work. The audit
    process, as currently constituted, is an almost perfect fit for the increased
    efficiency and automation provided for by a variety of blockchain tools. Audits,
    and these similarities tend to exist across geographic and firm lines, tend to
    contain several of the same core components. An engagement letter is composed,
    outlining the services to be provided by the external audit organization, including
    but not limited to the testing of certain assets, verification of financial statement
    amounts, and then the issuance of an opinion based on these amounts. Even with
    these tests and analyses, some of which may be quite sophisticated in nature,
    there is a fundamental time lag issue that usually remains unaddressed despite
    how efficient the audit process is. Put simply, the amount of time that passes
    between when the data is actually generated or produced, and the time that the
    audit actually occurs can stretch into months. Even with interim work, or work
    performed at different times during the year, there is still often a substantial
    lag between when data (and potential errors) happen, and when that data and potential
    errors are reported to management. The figure below represents areas in a financial
    transaction (trading) in which potential audit and attestation implications will
    arise, and can be aided by the implementation of emerging technologies (Fig. [13.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_13_Chapter/467992_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_13_Chapter/467992_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png)

    into the analysis and conversation, but actually is a fundamental change in how
    information is processed and reported to the marketplace. Even with current automation
    and associated efficiencies the fact remains that financial information is not
    usually reported or analyzed in a real time manner. From the smallest organizations
    operated by individual practitioners to the largest and most global firms the
    month end closing and reporting process can take days if not weeks. Such a delay
    in the reporting of information can lead not only to omissions of important data,
    but also open the door for fraudulent activities to be undertaken by unethical
    actors. Additionally, and bridging the gap between the current financial markets
    and emerging technologies is that, as data can be processed and reported on a
    more continuous basis, it also raises the potential of fraud happening on a continuous
    basis as well. Audit, attestation, and assurance services depend on the ability
    of the practitioners involved in the process having the capability to examine
    and analyze the information associated with the organization (Drew [2018](#CR3)).
    If, however, these pieces and aspects of information are stored and positioned
    on systems that operate, approve, and validate the data with minimal or virtually
    no human involvement this will also lead to a fundamental change to audit processes
    and procedures themselves.

- en: Making the shift, from a function most commonly associated with compliance based
    work to a forward looking partner and strategic advisor will require that some
    of the underlying tasks and processes currently performed by financial professionals
    must change. The concept of a more continuous auditing and attestation  is not
    a new desire for either auditors or management professionals, but the rise of
    automation and AI tools makes such continuous work increasingly possible. At the
    end of the day, regardless of industry affiliation or geographic location, the
    leaders and management professionals require high quality information to make
    decisions. Even though strategy and strategic planning may initially appear to
    be a qualitative conversation and event, every strategic investment and choice
    requires a strong foundation of quantitative information. Financial professionals
    are uniquely positioned to leverage existing competencies to parse through, analyze,
    and interpret the virtually endless streams of information that are generated
    from the ecosystem of sensors, connected devices, and mobile friendly products
    in place at nearly every organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With these large amounts of information generated on a nearly continuous basis,
    and including both structured and unstructured data, financial professionals need
    to adjust attest and verification processes to keep pace. In order to provide
    an appropriate reporting framework and guidance to assist with the decision making
    process, auditing must not only become more continuous in nature but also more
    comprehensive (Alexander [2018](#CR1)). Drilling down into what a more comprehensive
    audit will actually mean in practice is that auditing must also focus not only
    on structured data (such as reports generated in Excel or .csv formats), as well
    as analyzing and verifying data produced from different streams such as that data
    generated from social media. No matter what type of data and information is generated
    and what is the focus of the more comprehensive audit, the underlying principle
    is the more real time data is necessary to making better choices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A real time analysis of information also seems to indicate that the current
    construct and operating methodology of reporting is no longer sufficient. Quarterly
    guidance, issuing statements on a periodic basis, and restricting the flow of
    information from the organization to the marketplace creates an information asymmetry
    that is not sustainable in the current business climate. This delay in information
    and the data communicated from management to marketplace is, over time, being
    supplanted and augmented via social media. In August of 2018 for example, the
    co-founder and CEO of Tesla publicly tweeted, via his own Twitter handle with
    tens of millions of followers indicating a plan to take the organization private.
    That, in and of itself, would have not been an issue, but in that seem tweet Musk
    also indicated there was funding already secured. Compounding the potential legal
    jeopardy of this tweet are previous statements and comment made my Musk indicating
    a desire to punish and financially damage individuals and organizations who had
    taken a short position in Tesla. Combining this three forces together has, as
    of this writing, created a situation in which the SEC is has launched an investigation
    in this behavior. The ramifications of this specific incident will, of course,
    be the subject of analysis and discussion moving forward, but also indicates the
    shift from periodic reporting and disclosures of data to an environment more closely
    aligned with continuous reporting.

- en: Clearly the shift and evolution toward a more continuous audit function and
    practice is going to require that audit and attestation professionals be able
    to not only understand the potential of increased automation, but also the shortcomings
    that will be associated with this transition. For example, if confirmations of
    payables, receivables, and other financial balance information are no longer necessary,
    the basic processes by which data is created and recorded both on the income statement
    and balance sheet of the client organization will have to be improved. One again
    simply accelerating the pace with which bad or incorrect data is assembled onto
    the balance sheet will not improve the results of analysis of the organization.
    Accounting practitioners, but also any individual or practitioner employed within
    the financial services sector will also need to be able to balance the potential
    of technology tools and the realities on the ground. Investors, traders, and other
    individuals involved in the service areas linked to financial services will also
    need to be aware of how best to interpret, understand, and report the volume of
    information compiled and reported by different aspects of the organization.

- en: At first glance the potential  of more continuous reporting and communication
    of information from the organization to the marketplace would seem to be almost
    a uniformly good news and piece of information for practitioners. Regardless of
    where an individual is employed or what sector of the marketplace an individual
    practitioner looks to operate within there is always a need for more information,
    and especially data that is more timely in nature. With these associated benefits
    and upsides there are, however, several implications  that do need to be taken
    into account as this type of reporting becomes more common. Drilling down specifically
    there are several implications – with both positive and negative possibilities –
    that need to be factored into a broader analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, and something that has been referenced previously throughout this text,
    is that as more and more of underlying processes are automated and streamlined
    the need for systems auditors, control specialists, and technology experts will
    increase. This is directly connected to the primary business use cases for blockchain
    and blockchain augmented systems, or in other words being able to identify and
    assess what specific problems blockchain is being used to solve (Gales [2019](#CR4)).
    Whether it comes to automated trading platforms and strategies – some of which
    underpin the largest financial institutions in the world, or making sure that
    data is initially recorded and reported correctly there will be an expectation
    that financial professionals will take advantage of these tools to improve client
    service. Especially in a business environment where a headline or single news
    story can move markets in substantial ways, the cleanliness of information is
    absolutely imperative. This aspect, the growing importance of data integrity and
    standardization, also connects to a second implication of more continuous data
    and information.
  prefs: []

- en: Second, the flow of data in and out of an organization on a more continuous
    basis makes it almost a guarantee that customers will be able to make more well
    informed decisions. From a value proposition perspective, in effect, customers
    and clients are more likely to pay for forward looking or advisory based services
    than current product offerings. This is not an abstract idea or concept, and is
    already being felt across the entire financial services sector (McNally [2019](#CR8)).
    Margin compression in trading and asset management have been sending ripple effects
    in the markets for years, and this is something that will only continue. Frankly
    as consumers and clients become used to more technological integration into other
    aspects of there lives, on-demand services, and reduced prices along with these
    trends, these are driving changes at different organizations. Fees, long a source
    of revenue and (more importantly) profitability for organizations, are under pressure
    from an industry and regulatory perspective as well. With these potential challenges
    and obstacles, however, there is also the fact that clients are willing to pay
    premiums for advice and guidance that are going to help them moving forward and
    deliver value to portfolios and other asset strategies. Especially from an accounting
    and reporting point of view this is already resulting in generating new business
    lines, service offerings, and also raising the fact that entirely new firms are
    rising to fill this need in the marketplace.

- en: Perhaps one of the most interesting changes and developments that will inevitably
    arise and drive change in the financial services landscape linked to the broader
    blockchain and cryptocurrency environment is the importance of tax reporting,
    analysis, and information. Cryptocurrencies, although they may have peaked at
    the end of 2017 with a market capitalization of nearly $800 billion and be trading
    at much lower levels currently, have certainly attracted large numbers of investors,
    many of which have generated millions in returns and profits since the cryptocurrency
    space has been introduced into the marketplace. While individuals and institutions
    may have become involved in this space at different times, the regulatory landscape
    overall has only continued to shift and evolve over time, including the role of
    blockchain and cryptocurrency in the business landscape (Viniak [2019](#CR10)).
    Numerous regulatory and oversight agencies have weighed in, creating a situation
    where – depending on what aspect of reporting and taxation a practitioner is interested
    in – the answer and proposed solution to the tax issues may differ. Prior to drilling
    down into the differences between tax reporting and analysis that may occupy the
    time of practitioners, let’s take a look at how different cryptocurrencies may
    be classified and documented.

- en: Security token – boiled down to the core of idea, a security token can – and
    usually is – treated as the same as equity securities by regulators such as the
    S.E.C. That said, the core difference between security and utility tokens is that
    security tokens are similar to stock or company shared held by investors. They
    would, if not for the utilization of blockchain technology, most likely be issuing
    direct share or ownership in the organization instead of a security token. That
    said, it is important to recognize that even though these items may be considered
    security tokens, and not share themselves, that these items must be accounted
    for the same way regular share of stock would be reported.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What these means from a reporting, compliance, and income tax perspective is
    that these items, although they may actually be or represent cryptocurrencies,
    that they are still classified and treated as property. In addition to the technical
    specifications and requirements that underpin the ICO process itself, including
    but not limited to the development and coding of the blockchain platform itself,
    financial advisors and services professionals must also be able to successfully
    interpret these items and associated implications. Although these items might
    be considered cryptocurrencies, attract large amounts of attention and focus from
    non-traditional investors, the level of fiduciary duty owed to shareholders is
    the same.

- en: Utility token – in addition to wading through the terminology and technical
    jargon associated with the blockchain business landscape, it is also important
    for financial services advisors to be able to understand the business implications
    and ramifications of what this different terminology means. It may seem like there
    is a whirlwind of terminology, specific ideas, and applications that are driving
    change in the business landscape, but it is equally as important for financial
    services professionals to be able to deliver advice connected not only to the
    blockchain environment itself, but how the different classes of tokens and options
    may impact the business itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the context of a utility token it is important to understand that, versus
    a security token, a utility token does not represent ownership or an equity stake
    in the organization that is issuing the token. Instead, a utility token gives
    the investor access to the products or services of organization at a discounted
    rate. An analogy that might assist with understanding is that utility tokens are
    groupons or other forms of coupons that can redeemed to purchase items from the
    organization at some future date. Once the project itself is up and running, the
    initial buys and investors of utility tokens can sell tokens to new investors
    interested in using the products and services of organization.

- en: It is not enough that financial services professionals understand the differences
    between security and utility tokens; they must also be able to explain these differences
    to clients in a manner that makes sense. Especially in a business environment
    and landscape where information is widely distributed than ever before it is critical
    that financial professionals not only fill the role of subject matter expert,
    but also one of interpreter and translator. Simply put, clients and customers –
    be they internal or external in nature – are going to be depend on the advice
    and guidance that financial service professionals provide in these emerging areas.

    the rise of populism – in whatever specific form it manifests itself within –
    the implications for financial services and information are profound. Specifically,
    there are different proposals that have been put into practice, and other ideas
    and concepts that have been launched in preliminary stages that are directed at
    taxing the wealth and assets of individuals. In addition to taxing the income
    and earnings of individuals and organizations, which is relatively straight forward
    and well established (despite the various loopholes that do exist), this presents
    an opportunity for blockchain to assist in the collection and reporting of information.
    The taxation process related to income has, as surely financial professionals
    area aware of, recently did change significantly in the United States with the
    passage of corporate tax reform of 2017\. Individual and corporate tax reform,
    reporting, and collection also requires the analysis, reporting, and distribution
    of information between a number of different parties and institutions. What this
    means from a practical perspective, however, is that accounting, financial, and
    tax professionals are going to need to also factor into the integration of blockchain
    technology into new and emerging taxation issues.
  prefs: []

- en: One of the most challenging issues with implementing new tax policies – regardless
    of whether or not an individual or organizations are supportive of said policies –
    is the ability of practitioners to integrate new sources of information into current
    and proposed tax regimes (Gibson and Kirk [2016](#CR5)). Drilling down specifically
    to the implications and connections between blockchain based platforms and technologies
    and tax reporting and information, let’s take a look at how new and different
    blockchain based tax systems can facilitate the collection and reporting of information.
    Two of the most critical and emerging areas related to tax reporting and analysis
    are connected to various cryptoassets and the proposals connected to taxing the
    assets or “wealth” of certain individuals. Again, regardless of any individual
    or organizational opinion on the veracity or appropriateness of these tax proposals
    it is logical to conclude that as global wealth continues to increase and different
    classes of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated into the financial mainstream
    these are issues that practitioners need to be aware of moving forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, different cryptoassets that are stored, traded, and distributed
    via different decentralized and distributed, accounting and financial professionals
    are going to need to establish protocols and policies for tax reporting and analysis.
    This is yet another application of AI, automation, and blockchain based tools
    that can be operationalized to be implemented in tax, attestation, and other financial
    services practices (Hood [2018](#CR6)) Examples of how this would work from an
    operational perspective is that, for professionals seeking to advise and offer
    guidance on tax issues is that certain exchanges and sources of information will
    need to be established and certified as legitimate sources of data for both reporting
    and tax information. Additionally, custody procedures and the ability to trace
    ownership back to original owners as well as anyone who has subsequently purchased
    these assets will need to be established. Where this actually applies and may
    offer an opportunity for proactive professionals connects to how services can
    e leveraged to help financial professionals to advance and develop across the
    board.

    taking advantage and leveraging financial and other quantitative organizational
    information. That said, and realizing that every situation and organization is
    unique, the current status and pace of how this data is compiled, analyzed, and
    reported to the marketplace is increasingly misaligned with stakeholder expectations.
    Not only do users of the financial statements wish to analyze and examine how
    the organization is performing, but they also want to see how the organization
    has achieved these goals. In addition to expecting to be delivered high quality
    information in a timely manner, it is increasingly expected that organizations
    will be able to deliver the results of said information in manner that includes
    other operational metrics. After all, if artificial intelligence tools are being
    synced up with the internet of things, why should these reams of important data
    be excluded from the reporting process?

    operations of the organization itself, presents both an opportunity and a challenge
    for practitioners. This also highlights the need education, both in traditional
    courses and via continuing education courses, to evolve and keep pace as the business
    landscape continues to rapidly evolve and change (Decker [2017](#CR2) & Ng [2019](#CR9)).
    Clearly one of the most high profile challenges associated with this situation
    is that the data being produced takes the form of unstructured information, or
    information that is not presented in an Excel, “.csv,” or other standardized financial
    format. A prime example of how this trend is manifesting itself in reporting dialogues
    and conversations is the development and implementation of non-financial reporting.

    process  more closely akin to a continuous stream of information, it also appears
    logical to conclude that, as technology tools and processes become more prevalent,
    that nonfinancial data will also become increasingly included in the reporting
    process (Mahamuni [2019](#CR7)). While, framed in a traditional sense, the importance
    of nonfinancial data has been limited due to the lack of standards, frameworks,
    and consistency across industry lines, that does appear to be evolving. Whether
    this shift is driven or merely augmented by the technology trends of artificial
    intelligence and blockchain the underlying shift is clear. As more information
    and data is able to be analyzed across organizational lines, this does provide
    an opportunity for financial professionals to leverage existing competencies to
    directly add value to the decision making process. Simply reporting this information,
    however, does not in and of itself add value or generate insights for the management
    team; there needs to be a framework and standards to effectively work within this
    context. Fortunately, as more data is developed and produced within organizations,
    there are frameworks and standards increasingly common in the market to help effectively
    communicate this data. Specifically, and connecting directly to real world examples,
    there appear to be two shift and fundamental changes in how information is delivered
    from the organization to the market that align both with increased technological
    integration and competencies associated with financial professionals.

    as they relate to the marketplace are the audit and attestation implications of
    emerging technology; just how can these technology tools be employed by auditors
    or attestation professionals? This is not merely an academic or conceptual question;
    as emerging technology options are adopted by an ever increasing number of organizations
    across sector lines there is a definitive need for professionals to be able to
    attest to the accuracy of the data stored therein. While definitive guidance does
    not seem to be forthcoming from the FASB as it connects to broader accounting
    issues, as per a March 2019 public statement the FASB does appear to be working
    on and defining audit and other attestation standards. Several considerations
    and facts that are discussed within this chapter include, but are not limited
    to, how blockchains and other automated technology tools can actually be examined
    and automated. Specifically, what components and considerations can professionals
    take to gain increased transparency and better access to the data that are stored
    and communicated via a blockchain platform. Lastly, and something that still remains
    an emerging issue are how the continued integration of blockchain technology will
    change the role of audit professionals. Put another way, if practitioners are
    more involved with different aspects of blockchain development and implementation,
    does this violate the duty of independence necessary to complete and engage with
    audit and attestation work?
