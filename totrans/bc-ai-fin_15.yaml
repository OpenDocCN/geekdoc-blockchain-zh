    tokenUtility tokenSome of the most high profile work that has taken place, especially
    as it pertains to the accounting subset of the financial services landscape, is
    the work that has taken place linked to audit and attestation work. The audit
    process, as currently constituted, is an almost perfect fit for the increased
    efficiency and automation provided for by a variety of blockchain tools. Audits,
    and these similarities tend to exist across geographic and firm lines, tend to
    contain several of the same core components. An engagement letter is composed,
    outlining the services to be provided by the external audit organization, including
    but not limited to the testing of certain assets, verification of financial statement
    amounts, and then the issuance of an opinion based on these amounts. Even with
    these tests and analyses, some of which may be quite sophisticated in nature,
    there is a fundamental time lag issue that usually remains unaddressed despite
    how efficient the audit process is. Put simply, the amount of time that passes
    between when the data is actually generated or produced, and the time that the
    audit actually occurs can stretch into months. Even with interim work, or work
    performed at different times during the year, there is still often a substantial
    lag between when data (and potential errors) happen, and when that data and potential
    errors are reported to management. The figure below represents areas in a financial
    transaction (trading) in which potential audit and attestation implications will
    arise, and can be aided by the implementation of emerging technologies (Fig. [13.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_13_Chapter/467992_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_13_Chapter/467992_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png)

    tokenUtility token在财务服务领域，尤其是与会计相关的工作中，进行工作最为杰出的一部分，就是与审计和验货工作相关的工作。目前的审计过程几乎完美地适应了各种区块链工具提供的提高效率和自动化功能。审计，此类相似性跨越地理和公司边界存在，往往包含几个相同的核心组件。一份承诺函被撰写，概述了外部审计组织将提供的服务，包括但不限于对某些资产的测试、财务报表金额的核实，然后基于这些金额发表意见。尽管进行了这些测试和分析，其中一些可能是相当复杂的本质，但通常存在一个基本的时间滞后问题，尽管审计程序是多么高效。简而言之，数据实际生成或产生的时间与审计实际发生的时间之间的时间间隔可能会延长数月。即使进行了临时工作或在全年不同时期执行的工作，还是常常存在数据（和潜在错误）发生的时间和这些数据和潜在错误报告给管理层的时间之间存在实质性差距。下图代表了金融交易（交易）中潜在审计及验货影响的领域，并且可以通过新兴技术的实施得到帮助（图

    into the analysis and conversation, but actually is a fundamental change in how
    information is processed and reported to the marketplace. Even with current automation
    and associated efficiencies the fact remains that financial information is not
    usually reported or analyzed in a real time manner. From the smallest organizations
    operated by individual practitioners to the largest and most global firms the
    month end closing and reporting process can take days if not weeks. Such a delay
    in the reporting of information can lead not only to omissions of important data,
    but also open the door for fraudulent activities to be undertaken by unethical
    actors. Additionally, and bridging the gap between the current financial markets
    and emerging technologies is that, as data can be processed and reported on a
    more continuous basis, it also raises the potential of fraud happening on a continuous
    basis as well. Audit, attestation, and assurance services depend on the ability
    of the practitioners involved in the process having the capability to examine
    and analyze the information associated with the organization (Drew [2018](#CR3)).
    If, however, these pieces and aspects of information are stored and positioned
    on systems that operate, approve, and validate the data with minimal or virtually
    no human involvement this will also lead to a fundamental change to audit processes
    and procedures themselves.

    [2018](#CR3)）。然而，如果这些信息的部分和方面存储并定位在几乎没有或几乎没有人类参与的系统上，这也将导致审计过程和程序本身发生根本性变化。

- en: With these large amounts of information generated on a nearly continuous basis,
    and including both structured and unstructured data, financial professionals need
    to adjust attest and verification processes to keep pace. In order to provide
    an appropriate reporting framework and guidance to assist with the decision making
    process, auditing must not only become more continuous in nature but also more
    comprehensive (Alexander [2018](#CR1)). Drilling down into what a more comprehensive
    audit will actually mean in practice is that auditing must also focus not only
    on structured data (such as reports generated in Excel or .csv formats), as well
    as analyzing and verifying data produced from different streams such as that data
    generated from social media. No matter what type of data and information is generated

    [2018](#CR1)）。深入了解更全面审计在实践中的意义是，审计不仅必须关注结构化数据（例如在 Excel 或 .csv 格式中生成的报告），还要分析和验证来自不同流的数据，比如社交媒体产生的数据。无论产生什么类型的数据和信息，以及更全面审计的重点是什么，根本原则是实时数据是做出更好选择的必要条件。
- en: A real time analysis of information also seems to indicate that the current
    construct and operating methodology of reporting is no longer sufficient. Quarterly
    guidance, issuing statements on a periodic basis, and restricting the flow of
    information from the organization to the marketplace creates an information asymmetry
    that is not sustainable in the current business climate. This delay in information
    and the data communicated from management to marketplace is, over time, being
    supplanted and augmented via social media. In August of 2018 for example, the
    co-founder and CEO of Tesla publicly tweeted, via his own Twitter handle with
    tens of millions of followers indicating a plan to take the organization private.
    That, in and of itself, would have not been an issue, but in that seem tweet Musk
    also indicated there was funding already secured. Compounding the potential legal
    jeopardy of this tweet are previous statements and comment made my Musk indicating
    a desire to punish and financially damage individuals and organizations who had
    taken a short position in Tesla. Combining this three forces together has, as
    of this writing, created a situation in which the SEC is has launched an investigation
    in this behavior. The ramifications of this specific incident will, of course,
    be the subject of analysis and discussion moving forward, but also indicates the
    shift from periodic reporting and disclosures of data to an environment more closely
    aligned with continuous reporting.

  zh: 信息的实时分析似乎也表明，目前的报告构架和运作方法已经不再足够。季度指导，定期发布声明，以及限制组织向市场的信息流，造成了不可持续的信息不对称，这在当今的商业环境中是不可持续的。信息的延迟传递和来自管理层到市场的数据，随着时间的推移，通过社交媒体得到了取代和增强。例如，在2018年8月，特斯拉的联合创始人兼首席执行官公开在自己的
    Twitter 账户上发推文，拥有数千万的关注者，表明计划将该组织私有化。这本身不是问题，但在这条推文中，马斯克还表示已经获得了资金。这条推文的潜在法律危险性被进一步增加，因为马斯克之前曾表示希望惩罚和经济损害那些在特斯拉做空的个人和组织。将这三股力量结合在一起，截至目前，已经创建了一个情况，在这种情况下，证券交易委员会已经对这种行为展开了调查。这个特定事件的后果，当然，将成为未来分析和讨论的主题，但也表明了从定期报告和数据披露转向更贴近于连续报告的环境。
- en: Clearly the shift and evolution toward a more continuous audit function and
    practice is going to require that audit and attestation professionals be able
    to not only understand the potential of increased automation, but also the shortcomings
    that will be associated with this transition. For example, if confirmations of
    payables, receivables, and other financial balance information are no longer necessary,
    the basic processes by which data is created and recorded both on the income statement
    and balance sheet of the client organization will have to be improved. One again
    simply accelerating the pace with which bad or incorrect data is assembled onto
    the balance sheet will not improve the results of analysis of the organization.
    Accounting practitioners, but also any individual or practitioner employed within
    the financial services sector will also need to be able to balance the potential
    of technology tools and the realities on the ground. Investors, traders, and other

    - 具有积极和消极可能性 - 需要考虑进入更广泛的分析。
- en: First, and something that has been referenced previously throughout this text,
    is that as more and more of underlying processes are automated and streamlined
    the need for systems auditors, control specialists, and technology experts will
    increase. This is directly connected to the primary business use cases for blockchain
    and blockchain augmented systems, or in other words being able to identify and
    assess what specific problems blockchain is being used to solve (Gales [2019](#CR4)).
    Whether it comes to automated trading platforms and strategies – some of which
    underpin the largest financial institutions in the world, or making sure that
    data is initially recorded and reported correctly there will be an expectation
    that financial professionals will take advantage of these tools to improve client
    service. Especially in a business environment where a headline or single news
    story can move markets in substantial ways, the cleanliness of information is
    absolutely imperative. This aspect, the growing importance of data integrity and
    standardization, also connects to a second implication of more continuous data

  zh: 首先，正如本文中先前提到的，随着越来越多的基础流程被自动化和精简化，系统审计员、控制专家和技术专家的需求将增加。这直接与区块链和区块链增强系统的主要业务用例相关，或者换句话说，能够识别和评估区块链用于解决特定问题的具体情况（Gales
    [2019](#CR4)）。无论是自动交易平台和策略 - 其中一些支撑着世界上最大的金融机构，还是确保数据最初被记录和报告正确，人们都会期望金融专业人员利用这些工具来改善客户服务。特别是在一个头条新闻或单一新闻故事可以以重大方式推动市场的商业环境中，信息的准确性绝对至关重要。数据完整性和标准化的日益重要也连接到更连续数据和信息的第二个含义。
- en: Second, the flow of data in and out of an organization on a more continuous
    basis makes it almost a guarantee that customers will be able to make more well
    informed decisions. From a value proposition perspective, in effect, customers
    and clients are more likely to pay for forward looking or advisory based services
    than current product offerings. This is not an abstract idea or concept, and is
    already being felt across the entire financial services sector (McNally [2019](#CR8)).
    Margin compression in trading and asset management have been sending ripple effects
    in the markets for years, and this is something that will only continue. Frankly
    as consumers and clients become used to more technological integration into other
    aspects of there lives, on-demand services, and reduced prices along with these
    trends, these are driving changes at different organizations. Fees, long a source
    of revenue and (more importantly) profitability for organizations, are under pressure
    from an industry and regulatory perspective as well. With these potential challenges
    and obstacles, however, there is also the fact that clients are willing to pay
    premiums for advice and guidance that are going to help them moving forward and
    deliver value to portfolios and other asset strategies. Especially from an accounting
    and reporting point of view this is already resulting in generating new business
    lines, service offerings, and also raising the fact that entirely new firms are
    rising to fill this need in the marketplace.

    analysis, and information. Cryptocurrencies, although they may have peaked at
    the end of 2017 with a market capitalization of nearly $800 billion and be trading
    at much lower levels currently, have certainly attracted large numbers of investors,
    many of which have generated millions in returns and profits since the cryptocurrency

    overall has only continued to shift and evolve over time, including the role of
    blockchain and cryptocurrency in the business landscape (Viniak [2019](#CR10)).
    Numerous regulatory and oversight agencies have weighed in, creating a situation

    taxing the wealth and assets of individuals. In addition to taxing the income

  zh: 鉴于美国和全球政治环境，尤其是民粹主义的兴起不管以何种具体形式表现出来，对金融服务和信息的影响都是深远的。具体而言，已经有不同的提案被实施，和已经处于初步阶段的其他想法和概念旨在对个人的财富和资产征税。除了对个人和组织的收入和盈利征税，这相对直接而且已经建立起来的（尽管存在各种各样的漏洞），这为区块链提供了一个机会来协助信息的收集和报告。与与收入相关的税收过程有关的，正如财务专业人员所知道的那样，最近，随着2017年企业税改革的通过，美国的税收制度发生了重大变化。个人和公司的税收改革、报告和征收也需要对来自许多不同方面和机构的信息进行分析、报告和分发。然而，从实际角度来看，这意味着会计、金融和税务专业人士也需要考虑将区块链技术融入新的和新兴的税收问题中。
- en: One of the most challenging issues with implementing new tax policies – regardless
    of whether or not an individual or organizations are supportive of said policies –
    is the ability of practitioners to integrate new sources of information into current
    and proposed tax regimes (Gibson and Kirk [2016](#CR5)). Drilling down specifically
    to the implications and connections between blockchain based platforms and technologies
    and tax reporting and information, let’s take a look at how new and different
    blockchain based tax systems can facilitate the collection and reporting of information.
    Two of the most critical and emerging areas related to tax reporting and analysis
    are connected to various cryptoassets and the proposals connected to taxing the
    assets or “wealth” of certain individuals. Again, regardless of any individual
    or organizational opinion on the veracity or appropriateness of these tax proposals
    it is logical to conclude that as global wealth continues to increase and different
    classes of cryptoassets are increasingly integrated into the financial mainstream
    these are issues that practitioners need to be aware of moving forward.

  zh: 实施新税收政策最具挑战性的问题之一，无论个人或组织是否支持这些政策的能力都是将新信息源整合到现行和拟议的税收体制中（Gibson and Kirk [2016](#CR5)）。具体到与基于区块链的平台和技术与税收报告和信息之间的影响和联系，让我们看看新的和不同的基于区块链的税收系统如何促进信息的收集和报告。与税收报告和分析相关的最关键和新兴领域之一与各种加密资产和对某些个体的资产或“财富”征税的提案有关。再次强调，无论任何个人或组织对这些税收提案的真实性或适当性持何种观点，可以得出的逻辑结论是，随着全球财富不断增加，不同类别的加密资产越来越多地融入金融主流，这些都是从业人员未来需要意识到的问题。
- en: For example, different cryptoassets that are stored, traded, and distributed
    via different decentralized and distributed, accounting and financial professionals
    are going to need to establish protocols and policies for tax reporting and analysis.
    This is yet another application of AI, automation, and blockchain based tools
    that can be operationalized to be implemented in tax, attestation, and other financial
    services practices (Hood [2018](#CR6)) Examples of how this would work from an
    operational perspective is that, for professionals seeking to advise and offer
    guidance on tax issues is that certain exchanges and sources of information will
    need to be established and certified as legitimate sources of data for both reporting
    and tax information. Additionally, custody procedures and the ability to trace
    ownership back to original owners as well as anyone who has subsequently purchased
    these assets will need to be established. Where this actually applies and may
    offer an opportunity for proactive professionals connects to how services can
    e leveraged to help financial professionals to advance and develop across the
    board.

  zh: 例如，通过不同的去中心化和分布式存储、交易和分发的加密资产，会计和金融专业人员需要建立税务报告和分析的协议和政策。这是人工智能、自动化和基于区块链的工具的另一个应用，可以在税务、检验和其他金融服务实践中实施。（Hood
    [2018](#CR6)）从操作角度看，这将如何运作的例子是，对于寻求就税务问题提供建议并提供指导的专业人员来说，某些交易所和信息来源将需要建立并认证为合法的数据来源，用于报告和税务信息。此外，需要建立保管程序以及追溯所有权至原始所有者以及随后购买这些资产的任何人。这实际上适用并可能为积极的专业人士提供机会的地方，是如何利用服务来帮助金融专业人员在各个方面取得进步和发展。

    taking advantage and leveraging financial and other quantitative organizational
    information. That said, and realizing that every situation and organization is
    unique, the current status and pace of how this data is compiled, analyzed, and
    reported to the marketplace is increasingly misaligned with stakeholder expectations.
    Not only do users of the financial statements wish to analyze and examine how
    the organization is performing, but they also want to see how the organization
    has achieved these goals. In addition to expecting to be delivered high quality
    information in a timely manner, it is increasingly expected that organizations
    will be able to deliver the results of said information in manner that includes
    other operational metrics. After all, if artificial intelligence tools are being
    synced up with the internet of things, why should these reams of important data
    be excluded from the reporting process?

- en: This situation, the availability of information extracted directly from the
    operations of the organization itself, presents both an opportunity and a challenge
    for practitioners. This also highlights the need education, both in traditional
    courses and via continuing education courses, to evolve and keep pace as the business
    landscape continues to rapidly evolve and change (Decker [2017](#CR2) & Ng [2019](#CR9)).
    Clearly one of the most high profile challenges associated with this situation
    is that the data being produced takes the form of unstructured information, or
    information that is not presented in an Excel, “.csv,” or other standardized financial
    format. A prime example of how this trend is manifesting itself in reporting dialogues
    and conversations is the development and implementation of non-financial reporting.

- en: In addition to the transition from the traditional periodic reporting to a reporting
    process  more closely akin to a continuous stream of information, it also appears
    logical to conclude that, as technology tools and processes become more prevalent,
    that nonfinancial data will also become increasingly included in the reporting
    process (Mahamuni [2019](#CR7)). While, framed in a traditional sense, the importance
    of nonfinancial data has been limited due to the lack of standards, frameworks,
    and consistency across industry lines, that does appear to be evolving. Whether
    this shift is driven or merely augmented by the technology trends of artificial
    intelligence and blockchain the underlying shift is clear. As more information
    and data is able to be analyzed across organizational lines, this does provide
    an opportunity for financial professionals to leverage existing competencies to
    directly add value to the decision making process. Simply reporting this information,
    however, does not in and of itself add value or generate insights for the management
    team; there needs to be a framework and standards to effectively work within this
    context. Fortunately, as more data is developed and produced within organizations,
    there are frameworks and standards increasingly common in the market to help effectively
    communicate this data. Specifically, and connecting directly to real world examples,
    there appear to be two shift and fundamental changes in how information is delivered
    from the organization to the market that align both with increased technological
    integration and competencies associated with financial professionals.

  zh: 除了从传统的周期性报告转向更类似于持续信息流的报告过程之外，逻辑上也可以得出结论，随着技术工具和流程变得更加普遍，非财务数据也将越来越多地包含在报告过程中（Mahamuni
    [2019](#CR7)）。 在传统意义上，由于行业间标准、框架和一致性的缺乏，非财务数据的重要性受到了限制，但这似乎正在发生变化。无论这种转变是由技术趋势人工智能和区块链推动还是仅是增强，基本的变化是清晰的。随着跨组织线进行更多信息和数据的分析，这确实为金融专业人士提供了一个机会，可以直接为决策过程增加价值。然而，仅仅报告这些信息本身并不能增加价值或为管理团队产生见解；在此情境下需要框架和标准来有效地工作。幸运的是，随着组织内部产生和开发了更多数据，市场上日益普遍的框架和标准可帮助有效地传达这些数据。具体而言，并直接连接到实际的例子，似乎有两个变化和基本变化，这些变化影响着信息从组织传递到市场，与增加的技术整合和与金融专业人员相关的能力力量对齐。

- en: One of the most important considerations and topics that are still evolving
    as they relate to the marketplace are the audit and attestation implications of
    emerging technology; just how can these technology tools be employed by auditors
    or attestation professionals? This is not merely an academic or conceptual question;
    as emerging technology options are adopted by an ever increasing number of organizations
    across sector lines there is a definitive need for professionals to be able to
    attest to the accuracy of the data stored therein. While definitive guidance does
    not seem to be forthcoming from the FASB as it connects to broader accounting
    issues, as per a March 2019 public statement the FASB does appear to be working
    on and defining audit and other attestation standards. Several considerations
    and facts that are discussed within this chapter include, but are not limited
    to, how blockchains and other automated technology tools can actually be examined
    and automated. Specifically, what components and considerations can professionals
    take to gain increased transparency and better access to the data that are stored
    and communicated via a blockchain platform. Lastly, and something that still remains
    an emerging issue are how the continued integration of blockchain technology will
    change the role of audit professionals. Put another way, if practitioners are
    more involved with different aspects of blockchain development and implementation,
    does this violate the duty of independence necessary to complete and engage with
    audit and attestation work?
