    through Boston traffic, trying to make it to our 9:00 a.m. event to kick off Boston
    Blockchain Week. We had rented a bus and turned it into a party on six wheels:
    the Blockchain Bus.'

    geeks on the Blockchain Bus. We had removed the seats and hung a disco ball. There
    was a lavish breakfast spread, and a few people were getting the drinking started
    early. Outside the bus, it was rush hour on a Monday.

    trying to get around us. The bus was jammed between lanes, and it soon turned
    into a cacophony of honks. The Blockchain Bus was the Block-Traffic Bus.

    you a few questions,” Steve continued, “and we’ll edit it down to about ten seconds
    to run during NPR drive time. First off, tell us about Boston Blockchain Week.”

    did this. He cut a bunch of wood blocks, personalized each one for a friend or
    family member, then strung them together with chains.
  prefs: []

    before long, the project went viral and he had hundreds of people sending him
    money to personalize their blocks on the Literal Blockchain, in the same way that
    people will buy a memorial brick at the local playground.

    The blockchain isn’t a physical “thing,” but sometimes you need to draw it like
    one.

    designed to hold all your driving data: when you left the house, when you arrived,
    how many miles you drove, how fast you were traveling, and so on. Let’s say you
    have a little GPS device that tracks all this data automatically.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to develop personalized rates for you. (A safe, infrequent driver will get better
    rates than a reckless, frequent one.)

    with the users of that ledger represented on both sides. Remember the ledger is
    distributed, meaning it’s replicated across hundreds or thousands of different
    computers. (No one person owns it.) But, for simplicity, let’s draw it as a block.
  prefs: []

- en: Because a blockchain is often a two-sided marketplace—bitcoin, for example,
    has a “buyer” and a “seller”—we connect the two parties to the block with a chain.
    And the GPS unit, which is just feeding the blockchain with data on your driving
    behavior, is shown with an arrow.

    sits on some insurance company’s computer. It’s now on a shared blockchain that
    multiple insurance companies can access, all competing to give each driver the
    best rates, based on his or her risk profile.'

    assembled so early on a Monday. The media were hungry for anything about blockchain,
    especially a press conference as weird as this one.
  prefs: []

    the warning label that read DO NOT STAND ON THIS STEP—and held on to the street
    sign so I wouldn’t fall off.

    atop the ladder, a gust of wind hit me, and I wobbled a bit, tightening my grip
    on the Beacon Street sign.

    it fit perfectly.

    above the sidewalk.
