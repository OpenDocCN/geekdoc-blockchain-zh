    into new milestones of exponential growth with high intensity of velocity, scope,
    and system impact. Technological advancements in the fields such as artificial
    intelligence, internet of things (IoT), blockchain technology, and cyber physical
    systems have resulted in a breakthrough in capturing the potential to boost income
    levels and an improvement in the quality of life of various sectors of people
    worldwide. A continuous stream of input data generated by IoT devices can assist
    to closely monitor an industry's various production phases. Edge computing and
    AI process these data at the end node, while blockchain technology provides a
    distributed secure data environment for both financial and non-financial applications.
    Security measures must be built into all manufacturing systems, allowing for failsafe
    production and cyber threat protection. In this chapter, the authors look at how
    these technologies can be used in a variety of scenarios to boost productivity

- en: Contemporary industry has witnessed major impetus from the early 18th century
    due to the impact of great innovations in technology. The ultimate goal in each
    phase of the industry changes is to improve the efficiency of manufacturing reducing
    the wastage resulting into more production. Industry 4.0 or the 4th industrial
    revolution also sometimes referred to as Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT)
    in the manufacturing sector is the conglomeration of physical production and technology
    with that of smart digital technology using AI and machine learning, big data,
    cloud computing, IoT, blockchain Technology, cyber physical systems and Edge computing.
    Always Industry works in tandem with the desired process, partners, products and
    the people. The challenge in the day to day operations of the company is to produce
    effective output to maintain the connectedness and obtain the insights of the
    real time data across all these entities. The interconnectivity is possible for
    the smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0 with these Industrial IoT devices connected
    to the cloud working with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence and is secured
    with the aid of blockchain technology. A continuous stream of input data generated
    by IoT devices can assist to closely monitor an industry's various production
    phases. The sensors at these locations can be linked to applications that can
    provide a visual representation of the operations. These applications are capable
    of not only presenting the data as it is in sequence towards being insightful,
    but also of displaying intelligence by predicting the output in the future in
    order to make the necessary decisions using the appropriate machine learning algorithms.
    Edge computing and artificial intelligence process these data at the end node
    and intermediate node levels, while blockchain technology provides a distributed
    secure data environment for both financial and non-financial applications. Blockchain
    technology is now a tried-and-true method for tracking goods in logistics. It
    is critical in smart manufacturing to discern among machine health tracking, predictive
    maintenance, and production scheduling. Deep learning algorithms are used in smart
    factories to control machines using time-series data. Edge computing in smart
    manufacturing has thus proven to improve processing time for the machine environment
    with a large number of tasks. Traditional manufacturing plants were not designed
    to work in conjunction with cybersecurity arrangements. When these industries
    transition to the new paradigm of IoT devices with IP-based systems, they are
    more likely to be attacked by hackers. There is a greater risk of cybercrime,
    which can result in unauthorized remote access, theft of intellectual property,
    data manipulation, signal interference, and data loss. Security measures must
    be built into all manufacturing systems from the start, allowing for failsafe
    production and cyber threat protection. Because manufacturing equipment has a
    long life cycle, it is also critical that the solutions chosen have built-in flexibility
    and advanced over-the-air updating solutions to prevent threats today and in the
    future. A suitable secure architecture can generate, distribute, and authenticate
    devices in order for them to interact with users and applications

- en: 'Industry4.0 was first coined in 2011 by three engineers: Henning Kagermann
    (physicist and one of the founders of SAP) (Henning Kagermann, 2011), Wolfgang
    Wahlster (professor of artificial intelligence), and Wolf-Dieter Lukas (physicist
    and senior official at the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)
    in the german language ‘Industrie4.0’ in an industrial fair at Hannover Messe.
    Since then, the term Industrie 4.0 has sparked a vision of a new Industrial Revolution
    and has sparked a vigorous, ongoing debate about the future of work, and hence
    society, among the German public. In 2013, Industry4.0 manifesto(“Recommendations
    for Implementing the Strategic Initiative INDUSTRIE 4.0\. Final Report of the
    Industrie 4.0 Working Group,” n.d.) was prepared by German National Academy of
    Science and Engineering (acatech). The discussion around this future vision eventually
    extended to other countries, with public awareness peaked in 2016 when the World
    Economic Forum met in Davos under the banner Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
    Industry 4.0-related issues are addressed and developed by the Public-Private
    Partnership (PPP) for Factories of the Future (FoF). The evolution of Industry4.0
    is described as application of inventions and discoveries from time to time as
    tools and techniques with the objective for producing goods in large numbers,
    less production cost, less time eventually resulting in lower product cost.'

    as mining, textiles, glass, and agriculture due to many inventions like steam
    engine, spinning jenny and water wheel. James Hargreaves devised the spinning
    jenny, a multi-spindle spinning frame, in 1764 or 1765 in England. The gadget
    cut down on the amount of time it took to make cloth. It aided in the establishment
    of the cotton industrial system. Improvements in transportation and communication,

    work smarter and more connected, resulting in increased speed and flexibility
    in production. In the present scenario, natural resource extraction, excessive
    waste creation, and global warming are all well-known issues in the industries.
    In this regard, recent searches have shown how a circular model for reusing waste
    improves the entire supply chain for manufacturing products, while many have focused
    on the influences of technological innovations in the domain of manufacturing,
    optimization processes, and scheduling problems to resolve the issue of industrial
    pollution and resource waste. In the perspective of Industry4.0, a Smart Factory
    is a manufacturing solution that delivers such flexible and adaptable production
    processes that will tackle problems that arise on a production facility with dynamic
    and fast changing boundary conditions in the world of increasing complexity. This
    approach may be related to automation, which is defined as a mixture of software,
    hardware, and/or mechanics. On the other hand, it could be viewed from the standpoint
    of collaboration between various industrial and nonindustrial partners, with the
    smartness stemming from the creation of a dynamic organization. Smart products
    are those that can perform calculations, store data, interact with others, and
    connect with their surroundings. Industry 4.0 provides a better collaborative
    value (smarter services and processes) by bringing together new and expanded skills
    and skills in a supply network using new technology, particularly information
    and communication technology. Smart manufacturing, the use of Cyber Physical Systems
    (CPS) for production, i.e. embedded actuators and sensors, computing device networks,
    and connecting machines to the value chain, are all key components of Industry
    4.0\. Smart manufacturing includes technologies such as smart sensors, IoT, cloud
    computing, Blockchain Technology and Big data. Autonomous robots, augmented reality,
    additive manufacturing, cybersecurity, and horizontal and vertical integration
    are other technologies mentioned in the Industry4.0 recommendations document.
    The figure (Figure 1: Adoption of technologies in Industry4.0 for smart manufacturing)
    indicates the adoption of technologies in Industry4.0\. Industrial Artificial
    Intelligence technologies are mostly used to help intelligent manufacturing. Despite
    the fact that the corresponding research is still in its early stages, IAI is
    gaining traction, undergoing rapid technical improvement, and making significant
    progress in applications. Smart devices, such as IoT and CPS, have now established
    themselves as a global paradigm capable of radically transforming any industry
    equipped with sensing, identification, remote control, and automated control capabilities.
    Because they rely on expensive centralized servers that are similarly costly to
    build and maintain, it is especially suitable for Industry 4.0 applications with
    medium and heavy user and computational loads. Blockchain may add value by facilitating
    the transformation from the Internet of Information to the Internet of Value,
    as well as the construction of a true peer-to-peer sharing economy, by replacing
    centralized servers with decentralized servers and evolving the existing Internet.'

    CPS connects the virtual and physical worlds to form a network of intelligent
    objects that can communicate and interact with each other. Systems in which cyber

    that are regulated by physics rules and operate in real time. The first stage
    in designing a Cyber-Physical System application is obtaining precise and trustworthy
    data from machines and their components. Sensors may collect data directly, or
    data may be collected from controllers or corporate manufacturing systems. Data
    must be used to derive relevant information, such as evaluating health value,
    estimating remaining usable life, and so on. In this architecture, the cyber level
    serves as the core information hub. To construct the machines' network, information
    is pushed to it from every linked machine. The level of cognition generates a
    full understanding of the monitored system. The correct presentation of gained

    are able to interpret the concept of a wood. From then on, he can recognize any
    wood, even if it is shaped differently or has different colors or textures than
    the wood he has previously seen. This is a tremendously powerful capacity that
    humans take for granted because our brains do it so well naturally. Artificial
    neural networks (ANNs)(Lemley et al., 2017) are capable of learning something
    about what they observe and then generalizing that information to new examples
    (or specimens). An input layer, an output layer, and one or more so-called hidden
    layers are essential in neural networks. These layers are made up of nodes, sometimes
    known as neurons that are connected to succeeding and prior layers in a variety
    of ways. Axons receive input from other neurons, and dendrites transfer information
    to other cells in the biological model. In a neural network, this relates to the
    input and output connections. The soma is the body of a biological neuron, and
    it can determine when and what to transmit based on a variety of factors. The
    activation function, which is seen in artificial neurons, works in a similar way.
    A classification task is the process of determining which category a piece of
    data belongs to. Generalization is the ability to classify previously unseen examples.
    ANNs are particularly useful in problems when the desired output cannot be predicted
    ahead of time. Training refers to the process of teaching our network. The training
    set is a collection of data that we believe is sufficiently representative for
    our network to learn from. The validation set is the set of data on which we base
    our model''s evaluation during training. The task is the skill that we want our
    network to learn. When an ANN isn''t sufficiently trained to do this, we term
    it underfitting, which suggests the network didn''t learn the training set well
    enough. Overfitting is the inverse of this, when the network learns the training
    set so well that it can''t be applied to data it hasn''t seen before. Neural networks
    can perform two types of learning: 1) supervised learning, in which the data is
    labeled or annotated in some way, and the job is to learn to match the data to
    the labels; and 2) unsupervised learning, in which the data is not labeled and
    the neural network learns to find relationships between data. The weights are
    updated and the way the loss changes over time is measured using training algorithms.
    Gradient descent optimizers are commonly used to do this. Back propagation is
    a technique for propagating error information from the last layer to the first
    layer in order to adjust the weights, and it''s commonly confused with training.
    Learning rules are techniques that can be used to improve the performance of a

    In the process, some information is lost. Although that information isn''t always
    necessary for interpreting the underlying analog signal, we could lose essential
    data, like high-frequency information, in some cases. We often refer to a piece
    of data, such as an image, as a sample in digital processing. The representation
    of these samples in a high-dimensional space, where each unit (or pixel in the
    case of images) is regarded to be positioned on a specific axis, with the range
    of potential values being the size of that axis, is handy but computationally
    expensive. A vector, which is a point in a 10,000-dimensional space, would be
    used to represent a 100 x 100 pixel image. This area is referred to as the feature
    space. We aim to limit the number of dimensions to only those that are necessary
    for the work at hand, or we adapt the way these features are represented. To accomplish
    a task in the typical pattern recognition technique, we divide our process into
    two steps: feature generation and feature selection. The former creates new features
    from the pixel space, whilst the latter lowers the feature space''s dimensionality.
    Morphological, Fourier, and wavelet transforms are examples of feature generating
    techniques that provide more relevant features for certain applications. Principal
    component analysis and linear Fisher discriminant are examples of feature selection
    methods. Instead of attempting to lower the dimensions, a recent strategy based
    on sparse mapping argues for growing the dimensions with the purpose of reflecting

    store and transfer data in a distributed, transparent, and tamper-proof manner.
    Each block contains data and uses pointers to connect to other blocks. Such connections
    safeguard the blockchain''s integrity and resistance to tampering. A blockchain
    transaction is made up of several steps. A network node or a user requests a new
    transaction first. The transaction is then written down in block format or structure.
    The index, time-stamp, data, previous hash, and current block hash make up the
    block structure. Blockchain systems(Raj et al., 2020, p. 9) are classified as
    public, private, or consortium. Industry 4.0-based applications can be seamlessly
    integrated with blockchain. It makes use of smart contracts, which do away with
    the need for paper contracts and regulate the network by consensus. Smart Contracts
    are a mechanism that allows transactions to be completed without the involvement
    of a third party, making them irreversible and traceable. The shared ledger should
    not be tampered with or updated for any of the records on the network. The integrity
    of the saved data is ensured as a result of this. Transactions should only be
    updated when all of the network''s verified users agree using consensus techniques.
    A block of transactions is broadcast to all of the network''s peer nodes. The
    SHA-256 technique is used by the blockchain network to generate a unique hash.
    Each block in the blockchain is linked to the previous block''s hash, resulting
    in an impenetrable network of transactions. If a transaction is attempted to be
    appended, it must be validated by network nodes or smart contracts, and consensus
    must be reached. This immutable record cannot be changed; instead, it can only
    be appended to block of transactions, resulting in a safe and dependable decentralized

    SDN is appropriate for large-scale and high-speed computing because the data-forwarding

    A service transactional block is formed when a manufacturing service is inquired
    and purchased. A transaction block of this type will be broadcast and validated

    build smart contracts between numerous interactive business partners, with the
    core protocols facilitating, verifying, and enforcing contract performance or
    negotiation. By enabling the identification, distribution, and validation of critical
    relevant data in a distributed manner, blockchain technology can be utilized to
    increase data integrity and eliminate data transmission hazards. Blockchain technology
    can be used to determine the source and destination of a data flow, as well as

    Model predictive control (MPC) (Shang & You, 2019) is a well-known and well-established

    past data into prediction models for unknowns, allowing the uncertainty to be

    of Things (IoT) technology to provide a link between digital and physical environments,
    as well as improvements to those digital environments through increased usage
    of cloud services, data analytics, and machine learning. Furthermore, as an organization

    the following unexpected number of attacks or points of attacks grows as well,
    depending on the number of extended systems and the attack surfaces specific to
    them. Smart manufacturing capabilities are based on levels of technical sophistication,
    integration, and automation far beyond those of conventional manufacturing processes;
    there will be new vulnerabilities, and the lack of clarity on security is doubly
    concerning. Security is a dynamic process that necessitates a variety of solutions
    to deal with ever-changing assaults. Vulnerabilities will always exist, regardless
    of how well prepared you are, and attackers will try to uncover them by attacking
    the system. To combat this, it's vital to pay attention to the dynamic behavior
    and assess whether it's aberrant. Despite all of the security mechanisms in place,
    successful attacks will continue to occur. When an incident occurs, the ability
    to respond safely, bring the system back to a safe state, and continue operations

- en: The utilization of next-generation smart manufacturing equipment, sensors, and
    processes is one of Industry 4.0's core characteristics, and the attack vectors
    used by cyber attackers must be evaluated in the context of the Industry 4.0 environment.
    Sensors utilized in the Industry 4.0 environment often contain some of the most
    recent technical breakthroughs and can typically work as small sub-systems within
    the larger context of the manufacturing information architecture. Unfortunately,
    security is seen as a secondary issue in many of these next-generation technologies.
    There are a number of distinct security issues that Industry 4.0 faces, each with
    its own set of characteristics that necessitate careful attention to its underlying
    mechanisms in order to be effectively addressed. Following are some of the security
    aspects that are addressed in the smart manufacturing scenarios.

    that has the potential to radically disrupt any industry that has sensing, identification,
    remote control, and automated control capabilities. The Internet and interconnected
    devices form the technological foundation of Industry 4.0, which focuses on process
    control with less human interventions and smart judgments, which has a tremendous
    impact on the worldwide market. This chapter covered the smart manufacturing system
    and its associated technologies, as well as newly presented paradigm and their
    impact on smart manufacturing technology, as well as related standardizations
    and challenges. In the security aspect, various attacks, the reasons for the attacks,
    the outcomes of the attacks and prevention of attacks are also discussed.
