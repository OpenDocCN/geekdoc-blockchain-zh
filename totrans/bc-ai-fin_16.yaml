- en: Integrated reporting, at the basis of the idea, is a comprehensive reporting
    framework that reflects both the increasing interest from stakeholders in understanding
    both how an organization generates results, but also how these results are created
    (Zhou et al. [2017](#CR8)). Without diving too much into the technical weeds and
    details associated with integrated reporting, it can be summarized as a methodology
    to report financial and operational data to external stakeholders. The core of
    this reporting framework, which has been adopted by a variety of organizations
    across industry lines on an international basis, can be summarized and highlighted
    via the multiple capital model. Even the name of the multiple capital model itself
    appears to connect the concept of more comprehensive reporting to the financial
    services profession, and includes a wide variety of information. Drilling down
    into the multiple capital model itself is logical, both from a tactical approach
    for financial services professionals as well as a strategic headset (Fig. [14.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_14_Chapter/467992_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_14_Chapter/467992_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.png)

    however, it appears important to acknowledge just what exactly such a framework
    may very well mean for accounting and finance professionals moving forward. Traditionally,
    the view of capital is something akin to a simplistic model only connected to
    the financial resources and assets at the disposal of the management team. While
    such a perspective and view point appears logical in nature, especially with the
    emphasis placed on meeting quarterly earnings targets by the marketplace, that
    generates an incomplete view of just how organizations are increasingly evaluated.
    Even sticking to the evidence offered by financial assets, records, and news updates
    it does appear logical to conclude that there is a growing interest in the following
    two forces, or rather a differentiated emphasis on what these two forces mean
    in the current market landscape (Avery [2017](#CR1)).

- en: Financial results are, clearly, the basis by which organizations and management
    teams are usually evaluated, but that is only part of the story, as any well educated
    and experienced financial services professional realizes. Specifically, the sustainability
    of operations, including but not limited individual sustainability projects but
    also the ability of the organization to generate results on a continuous basis,
    are both of interest to financial and nonfinancial stakeholders. Taking this into
    account, the development of more comprehensive and robust frameworks to fulfill
    the needs of end users appears logical (Moy Huber and Comstock [2017](#CR6)).
    While no reporting framework or methodology of doing business will ever be foolproof,
    nor address every possible contingency, the shift toward integrated reporting
    is a logical first step. Technology will invariably assist with this process,
    the more continuous and comprehensive reporting of data to end users, but it is
    also important to understand the underlying fundamentals, and be able to compare
    the data that is reported by any single organization to other comparable organizations
    (Chender [2019](#CR2)). Stated another way, while tools such as AI and blockchain
    may very well assist in the gathering and analysis of different types of information,
    financial professionals will need to understand both the technology and the underlying
    concepts in order to effectively advocate for, and lead, the necessary changes
    to keep pace with evolving market expectations.

    Emerging technology tools, including artificial intelligence and blockchain will

    angle to take in a book focusing on emerging technology, but there is one underlying
    connection that links together all of these areas. Be it integrated reporting  or
    some other form of more comprehensive reporting, these new models of information
    communication and disclosure are only possible due to the advances in technology
    that make the gathering and analysis of information possible (Greengard [2017](#CR4)).
    The growing interest in sustainability information and data also indicates a realization
    of the following reality; operational results are what drive financial performance
    any way. Even in the context of financial services firms, for example, it is increasingly
    important that management professionals track and evaluate the levels of employee
    engagement, training, and development. Several specific examples demonstrating
    that reality of this transition, integrating technology to develop more comprehensive
    and realistic reporting standards helps to illustrate how these trends are already

    the organization does business on a global basis with numerous external partners
    operating under different regulatory regimes. Despite this apparent fit and alignment
    with broader and technology enabled reporting goals the management team had to
    overcome the very same difficulties faced by organizations across industry lines.
    Namely, how can organizations and management professionals leverage current and
    emerging technology to both more effectively reporting information and communicate
    this data in a way is that makes for market participants? The approach embraced
    by Adidas, and establishing a connection between sustainability reporting, financial

    or portfolio in particular, but rather an approach closely aligned with the core
    operations of the business. In the case of Coca-Cola the resource and focus that
    formed the basis for more comprehensive and technologically enabled reporting
    was water, and specifically the stewardship of water by the management team at
    the firm. Partnering with individuals both internal to the firm, as well as external
    partners – totaling over 300 as this research – the results have been markedly
    impressive. With hundreds of millions invested, this represents definitive proof

    invariably give it an advantage and proverbial leg up when trying to implement
    a nice reporting structure, the connection between operations and bottom line
    results is clear. Having an appropriate mindset and correct strategic approach

    organization must also have the tools in place at the firm to translate this desire
    into reality. Building that bridge, and linking together the trends of technology
    integration and increased expectations from the marketplace presents an opportunity
    for both blockchain and artificial intelligence to create effective use cases.
    That said, and acknowledging the reality that operational data is important for
    both management and reporting purposes, there are direct connections that can
    be drawn between technology trends and other financial data. Specifically, and

    has to deal with, and even in the case of nonprofit organizations that do not

    conversation, namely the preparation and verification of tax information, it is
    also important to recall one particularly salient fact. Although the passage of
    the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) occurred at the end of 2017, and was put together
    and passed into law within the United States, the ramifications of this legislation
    are going to have to be profound as well as global in nature. Of particular importance

    tax code itself, that some of these alterations are either phased in, phased out,
    or only applicable to some types of organizations. Drilling down specifically

    role in the tax landscape. In spite of these numerous options and tools that already
    exist, however, they all do tend to rely on the same basic parameters, and do
    involve a relatively high amount of human oversight. Individual returns can be
    complicated enough, but when combined with the preparation of business returns,
    as well as the connections between, the various tax scenarios can become quite
    complicated. Artificial intelligence and blockchain, in whatever form is eventually

    add value in terms of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other emerging
    technology functions is the development and refinement of sector specific and
    industry driven platforms and standards. Specifically, public accounting firms
    and the employees therein should attempt – if at all possible – to harness emerging
    technologies to redefine how firms function, and how firms engage with clients
    throughout the year (Eisenstaedt [2019](#CR3)). Blockchain, for example, is a
    wide ranging and broad based technology application that has implications and
    potential across multiple industry lines, but there remain many open items, questions,
    and areas of concern as organizations seek to implement and refine blockchain
    based or blockchain augmented solutions. Every sector of the economy is obviously
    different, and each organization is different, facing different opportunities
    and challenges, but there are considerations that need to be addressed if financial
    service professionals wish to enter this lucrative market area.

    be assembled, which may both include general items as well as company specific
    issues. Of particular note for an assessment of industry to be comprehensive is
    the reality that – as of this writing and publication – the regulatory landscape
    as it is connected to these areas is still evolving. Data privacy considerations
    are discussed throughout this text, but analyzing broader rangers of changes and
    information are additional options for financial professionals. Offering advisory
    services requires that financial professionals understand not only the technical
    implications of emerging technologies, but also how said technologies may very
    well change due to the integration of said solutions. Without proposing the following
    as an exhaustive or all inclusive listing, there are the following items and considerations
    that apply to the following industries.

    arise when analyzing the real estate industry is the amount of paperwork and counterparties
    that are involved. Between the mortgage originators, commercial lenders, lenders
    and financiers to individuals, lawyers, realtors, title search agencies, and the
    real estate purchasers themselves the amount of paperwork and back and forth can
    rapidly become immense. Placed squarely at the center of this web of intersected
    parties is the reality that the financial implications and ramifications linked
    to real estate transactions can be quite large. While financial professionals
    will not play a leading or dominant role in the real estate process going forward,
    they can, and should, be involved in assessing control, financial and logistical
    issues with blockchain integration in the real estate space. Benefits and opportunities
    connected to increased blockchain technology can be accrued by virtually every
    party involved in a real estate transaction, even if those benefits are limited
    to paperwork reduction at the current state.

    times throughout this book, but that is because an industry such as insurance
    is almost tailor made for blockchain implementation. At the core of the idea of
    insurance is that it is a series of contracts and agreements made between unrelated
    parties or institutions that entitles one party (the insurer) to consistent compensation
    to finance payouts that the other party (the customers) is entitled to if certain
    conditions are met. In addition to the fiduciary duty that is embodied in any
    financial institution in charge of managing funds on behalf of others, insurance
    contracts and organizations also must deal with a fundamental lack of trust involved
    in the underlying business process. While fraud represents a relatively small
    percentage of total claims filed on an annual basis, the total amount estimated
    to be paid out in fraudulent claims totaled billions of dollars during the last
    several years. On top of the obvious financial implications and bottom line costs
    associated with paying out of fraudulent claims, the possibility of said fraudulent
    claims also increases the complexity and cost of the insurance payout process
    immensely.

    or set of protocols to govern insurance policies and regulations is somewhere
    financial professionals can certainly deliver value. Even as insurance organizations
    have launched blockchain based programs and models, many of said projects remain
    in the pilot or introductory stages. With the amount of capital put to work on
    behalf of the insurance organizations, coupled with amounts being invested into
    the blockchain arena alone it is logical to conclude that such implementation
    and development will continue. Specifically, and linked directly to blockchain
    itself, the continuous sharing and encryption of information between stakeholders
    in the insurance will reduce a large amount of the electronic float that can delay
    payouts linked to valid claims. Advising and offering services linked to data
    sharing regulations, building and testing automated payout processes via smart
    contracts, and developing protocols to invest the newly freed up capital due to
    the increased efficiency generated as a result of blockchain implementation.

    contamination, poor communication, and the lack of ability to trace back goods
    and good services back to the point of origin represent clear issues that must
    be addressed going forward. This also represents an intersection between how technology
    forces may be driving innovation directly with the financial services profession
    as well as being driven by implications and applications outside of the finance
    space. In the U.S. alone the food and restaurant industry is worth billions and
    employees tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people so the total potential
    market for advisory work in this space is significant.

    to change or augment technology solutions affiliated with a certain industry subset
    or sector is internal control implications and operational logistics of doing
    so. Specifically, the sharing of information and data between different stakeholder
    groups may be common in some situations – such as between Walmart and suppliers –
    but may not be common between other firms and suppliers. Layering blockchain solutions
    and protocols on top of and alongside current technology solutions such as RFID
    and EDI may seem contrary to the underlying promise of blockchain technology,
    but upon further reflection is apparently logical. This raises another issue that
    must be addressed during any consultative engagement; the reality that organizations
    have already invested millions – if not billions – in developing and maintaining
    current technology solutions. Introducing blockchain as a complementary and incremental
    solution, especially at first, may help lessen and reduce the potential push back
    and budgetary questions that may very well arise during such a robust technological
    implementation.

    Obviously this text has touched on the implications for internal controls and
    automated trading, but in addition to those rather obvious implications of blockchain
    there are number of different services and functions that should be developed,
    built out, and expanded as more technology tools become increasingly mainstream.

    connected to blockchain and other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence
    must be a part of any financial conversation. No matter where a CPA, financial
    advisor, or other financial services professional works within different organizations
    or advisory aspect of the finance field there is going to be contact and interaction
    with banks and other financial institutions. Without diving too much into the
    technical weeds of how the banking system functions – that in and of itself is
    an entire book on its own – there appears to be a 2-track system developing and
    becoming entrenched as a result of these emerging technology tools. While it is
    not always a bad thing to have a dual track system, or different options for individuals
    and institutions to utilize, these differences can have an impact on the services
    and advice professionals can offer to clients.

    after tentative interest and adoption – begun to move into the blockchain and
    cryptocurrency space with significant enthusiasm. What this has resulted in is
    the development of different types of blockchain based applications and models,
    particularly those that modify the original proof of work methodology and consensus
    based process for approving and distributing information stored on a blockchain
    platform. Ultimately what this may result in, which would undermine some of the
    initial enthusiasm and hopes for the ecosystem as a whole, is the creation and
    entrenchment of siloed blockchain and cryptocurrency based platforms. Drilling
    down specifically this might actually undo, and potentially replicate, some of
    the very issues and concerns currently cropping up around the sharing of other
    types of intellectual property and quantitative information.

    even in the case where that is not always true there does seem to alternate structures
    being formed. Regardless of an individual or organizational opinion on the veracity
    of these different options, or the underlying cause driving the development of
    these new systems. Increased fragmentation in the global finance and trade system,
    no matter what the underlying political or geo-political positions of the countries
    or organizations involved does point to something that might underpin the very
    concept of blockchain; decentralized and distributed storage and sharing of information.

    different business models that seem to evolving and developing alongside one another
    as the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem and business model continue to
    develop and become more integrated into mainstream financial conversation. For
    practitioners seeking to offer any level of advice or guidance related to cryptocurrency
    or blockchain services it is important that these individuals and associated organizations
    become familiar with the different business models. Trusts, most notably the models
    launched by Fidelity and Coinbase, have seem to have taken point position and
    leadership spots in the arena of offering different blockchain and cryptocurrency
    services from a financial services perspective. From an outside point of view,
    including the perspective that many clients and customers may very well have,
    there may not seem to be any difference between trusts and other types of banks
    or financial institutions, but there is one powerful different that must be taken
    into account. Trusts, even those as large and sophisticated as Fidelity and other
    global giants, must apply for trust licenses to operate across state lines. Put
    differently, if a trust wants to offer trust services related to blockchain and
    cryptocurrency they need to apply for trust licenses across states lines. Discussed
    in more depth later on in this book, the trend and market dynamic does appear
    to be shifting from a trust based model to one more closely affiliated with banking
    institutions.

    of the largest and most sophisticated financial institutions and banking groups
    in the world, launched an in house cryptocurrency to settle commercial transactions.
    Additionally, and leveraging the interest from both a commercial and regulatory
    perspective stablecoins, this coin – the JPM Coin – will also be pegged and redeemable
    for one USD. What this means from an application and implementation point of view
    and perspective is that these coins (or tokens) can actually be used to settle
    transactions that are part of the current financial system. It is true that such
    a partnership and coordination might be against the core ethos of original blockchain
    adopters, but it does seem to be the way that the overall ecosystem is shifting.
    It remains, of course, to be seen if the adoption of cryptocurrencies and tokens
    by major financial institutions actually does take off and become mainstream in
    nature, but this development does point to the. Stablecoins, by the very nature
    of the asset and coin itself, does seem to address a core issues that has, to
    date, prevented adoption by financial markets and institutions. While the initial
    blockchain model that will be utilized by JP Morgan to underpin the cryptocurrency
    marketplace may actually be much slower than the current model utilized by the
    DTCC it does point to an interesting development in the broader blockchain ecosystem

    as well as the information impacted by these processes is something that cannot
    be overstated as a responsibility and fiduciary responsibility of accounting and
    financial services professionals. This may seem like an unusual role or task for
    employees associated with CPA, CFA, or financial advisory roles, but is something
    that needs to become part of the conversation. In addition to helping organizations

    the professional conversation and dialogue is the refinement of blockchain standards
    and definitions. Whether these definitions and standard settings are linked directly
    to existing services and product offerings or if they are connected to emerging
    topic areas is not as important as who is providing these services to clients.
    As of this writing there is very limited authoritative or definitive guidance
    that has been issued either by domestic or international accounting bodies or
    industry groups. A dearth of official guidance represents both a challenge and
    opportunity for practitioners across different subsets of the financial services
    landscape. From the perspective of a challenge it means that clients – as well
    as practitioners – are working with incomplete or even inaccurate information
    as implementation projects are launched and developed, including bonds, networks,
    and other types of data (McLellan [2018](#CR5)). Establishing working definitions
    and models, however, requires that practitioners be able to articulate and explain
    what exactly these emerging technologies are, what they represent and how they
    connect with broader industrial and sector shifts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    seeking to help establish working definitions and terminology to increase the
    clarity in the space is to join industry or professional groups doing work in
    this area. The phrase thought leader or thought leadership may be on the verge
    of being overused in the current marketplace, but as it connects to items such
    as blockchain and artificial intelligence it does appear to represent an opening
    and opportunity for practitioners. It is appropriate to mention that, as with
    any industry or professional association, that taking into account the possibility
    of conflict of interest and collusion allegations are items that need to be taken
    into account and documented. As long as these items are appropriately considered
    and classified, there is no reason why financial professionals cannot deliver
    value to the marketplace in such a manner.

    or guidance, and especially if these pieces of advice are offered outside of the
    traditional areas of accounting and finance, there is a risk of exposure and/or
    liability. Especially in a business environment that, and particularly in the
    United States, is framed and categorized by the litigious nature of organizations
    this is something that cannot be overlooked. As demonstrated by the Big 4 accounting
    firms as well as many of the largest financial institutions in the world, all
    of which offer advisory services and have entire business lines and divisions
    built around offering these services, offering advisory services in such a litigious
    environment is difficult but not impossible. Even more important to the current
    conversation, and drilling down to a core point and piece of information driving
    change and disruption within the broader financial services landscape. Technology
    tools such as blockchain, robotic process automation, artificial intelligence,
    and cryptocurrencies present an array of opportunities and options for accounting
    and finance firms, but are also laying the groundwork for the fundamental restructuring
    of how services are provided. This is already occurring, with other technology

    many financial services professionals may have previously overlooked in the hustle
    and bustle of embracing emerging technologies. Corporate training, education,
    and development may have traditionally been perceived as a qualitative, optional,
    or otherwise non-core aspect of the services and value provided to the customers
    and clients, but that misses the broader opportunity that lies in this area. Although
    most, if not all, accounting firms and practitioners are members of various industry
    or sector organizations, there does appear to be a mismatch between the services
    provided by many of these industry organizations, and the needs of the firms themselves.
    In order for organizations to effectively leverage and maximize the technical
    capabilities of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain,
    and robotic process automation there are two distinct areas in which many practitioners
    and firms need to improve.

    at various firms, as well as the firm leadership itself, need to be aware of what
    exactly these tools are and how they function. Again, while it does not appear
    to be necessary that financial professionals will have to become programmers or
    technical experts, it will be necessary for those same practitioners to understand
    the fundamentals of these different tools. For example, practitioners will be
    able to articulate and communicate the differences between the various blockchain
    options including but not limited to public, private, and hybrid blockchain models.
    Each type of blockchain has positive attributes, negative qualities, and factors
    that must be assessed on a firm by firm basis. In addition to analyzing these
    traits and characteristics prior to implementation and adoption, it is also important
    for practitioners to maintain and track the process made by during the blockchain
    implementation project. As the project and initiative gets underway and begins
    to reach fruition another facet of blockchain technology must be assessed; the
    integration and intersection of blockchain with existing technology platforms
    and processes. Despite the possibilities and opportunities delivered via blockchain
    technology and platforms, it is critical that the intersection, bridges, and portals
    between blockchain and other technology platforms be maintained, updated, and
    reconciled as the inevitable changes occur.

    to be a gap between the expectations that are associated with AI and what current
