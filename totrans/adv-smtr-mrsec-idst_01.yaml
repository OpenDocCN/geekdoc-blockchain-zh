- en: A traceable, transparent, and authentic pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) could
    provide a guarantee for drug safety, quality, and a better public health protection.
    A thorough review of the PSC and future research agenda are necessary to understand
    the IoT and blockchain applications in PSC provenance. A systematic review was
    conducted to study how IoT and blockchain could help to cope with the challenges
    faced by the current PSC. The descriptive and thematic analysis was conducted
    to reveal the research trends, chronological and geographical distribution of
    research, and themes. The main findings were focused on the challenges faced by
    the current PSC, opportunities for implementing IoT and blockchain in PSC, as
    well as the application of IoT and blockchain in pharmaceutical package and transportation
    processes. Additionally, the study summarizes the framework of IoT and blockchain
    integration in PSC.

- en: Medicine supplies are one of the building blocks of healthcare systems (WHO,
    2010). In the present health-conscious society, the satisfactory quality and regulatory
    compliance of drugs have gained enormous attention globally due to the significant
    risk of counterfeit and unqualified medicines that could pose to consumer health
    (Sylim et al., 2018). From manufacturing to consumption, there are multiple partners
    and intermediaries involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC). This brings
    about great traceability challenges in present centralized systems such as single
    point of failure, data manipulation, interoperability, security, stakeholder agreement,
    implementation cost, lack of standardization and regulations (Premkumar and C,
    2020, Uddin et at., 2021). Operating with legacy information platforms could not
    assist the collaboration amongst multiple participants of PSC (Vecchione, 2017).
    It also could not support the tracking and tracing of sources required to ensure
    quality, regulatory compliance, and drug security.

- en: Internet of things (IoT) and Blockchain technology have been brought to the
    forefront of global attention in different industries. The application of IoT
    in supply chain management could support real-time information update and monitoring
    (Premkumar and C, 2020). The blockchain technology could document everything related
    to the whole supply chain and allow information sharing across the distribution
    network in a secure manner (Bocek et al., 2017). Implementation of drug provenance
    across the whole PSC is essential to strengthen the governance and supervision
    of the pharma market (Sylim et al., 2018). Hence, the application of IoT and Blockchain
    in PSC would have a tremendous role in future pharmaceutical domain. The application
    of IoT and blockchain could help to achieve the target of track and trace capability,
    authenticity and transparency by improving the collaboration, as well as, information
    sharing amongst the PSC stakeholders.

  prefs: []

- en: Supply chain is defined as a network of participants who cooperatively work
    together to convert basic materials into a specific finished product which is
    valued by end-customers (Settanni, Harrington and Srai, 2017). Supply chain also
    involves controlling, managing, and improving the flow of materials and information
    from suppliers to end-users (Harrison, et al., 2019, Uddin et at., 2021). Therefore,
    the PSC is a network between firms to produce, manage, distribute medicine and
    all the relevant information to the final buyer. The aim of PSC is aligning enterprises
    in enabling achievement of improving health status by pharmaceutical provision
    (Settanni, Harrington and Srai, 2017, Musamih et al., 2021). The PSC is complex,
    and its quality control process is strict (Vecchione, 2017, Ahmadi et al., 2020).
    From the aspect of involved participants, a typical PSC contains more than one
    participant. It not only includes the raw material suppliers, manufacturers, wholesalers,
    warehouse, distributors, retailers, and end-customers, but also the information
    agencies, government regulatory department such as Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA) (Sylim et al., 2018a, Uddin et at., 2021).

- en: The distribution network and regulations of PSC are complex. There are two distribution
    levels in PSC. Firstly, pharmaceutical manufacturers supply medicine from the
    point of production to the wholesaler, and this is also called the first level
    of drug distribution. In the second level of drug distribution, the products are
    transported from wholesalers to retailers, hospitals, or pharmacies (Jangir et
    al., 2019, Sunny et al., 2020). In some cases, manufacturers also distribute medicine
    directly to the government purchasers (Olson et al., 2018). From the aspect of
    regulation, the manufacturing of pharmaceutical must be in full compliance with
    Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) to ensure that medicinal products are consistently
    manufactured and controlled to the quality standards appropriate to their intended
    use and as required by the product specification (WHO, 2010). The distribution
    chain of medical products must follow Good Distribution Practices (GDP) to guarantee
    the original quality of medicine (WHO, 2010). The whole PSC is supervised and
    monitored by FDA (Uddin et at., 2021). The typical physical drug distribution
    and information flow of PSC is shown in Figure 1.

    concept of connecting devices and internet to facilitate data collection, sharing,
    and transmission over a network (Ben-Daya, Hassini and Bahroun, 2019, Jha et al.,
    2019, Kari et al., 2019). Xu et al. (2014) indicated that the IoT network is composed
    of four fundamental layers as follows. The detailed architecture of IoT is as

    could be defined as a network that could connect physical things digitally (Ben-Daya,
    Hassini and Bahroun, 2019). The digital connection model could sense and interact
    with several partners in a supply chain to achieve information sharing, quickness,
    visibility, and tracking (Xu, He and Li, 2014; Clauson et al., 2018).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain technology was created to support bitcoin transactions at first but
    as it develops, it has evolved to be more than a platform for storage of financial
    transactions managed by cryptography. For instance, there are some cases related
    to blockchain technology application in the health, food and agriculture industry
    (Rejeb, Keogh and Treiblmaier, 2019). It is defined as “a decentralized database
    that could store and share data with trusted partners across a peer-to-peer computer
    network in a secure, tamper proof environment” (Radanović and Likić, 2018).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain follows a decentralized network model and the data is shared and
    continuously synchronized across all nodes in the network (Sylim et al., 2018b).
    Blockchain consists of several blocks, with each block containing verified transactions,
    timestamp, current hash code and the hash code of the previous block (Xie et al.,
    2019). The new block is always connected with the previous block forming a chain
    of blocks arranged chronologically, so any change would occur disharmony (Pandey
    and Litoriya, 2020; De Aguiar et al., 2020).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, there are three types of blockchains, which are the public blockchain,
    the private blockchain and the consortium blockchain (De Aguiar et al., 2020;
    Molina, Delgado and Tarazona, 2019). The public blockchain, such as the Bitcoin
    network, is permission-less, and records are transparent to all nodes (Abbas et
    al., 2020). For the private blockchain, only the authorized participants could
    access the records, which provides a higher degree of privacy (De Aguiar et al.,
    2020). In the consortium blockchain, some records could be public while a part
    of records only could be shown to the specific private participants (Abbas et
    al., 2020).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Treiblmaier (2019) pointed out that the main characteristics of blockchain are
    data immutability, transparency, decentralization, time-stamped‚ tamper proof
    and security. Immutability does not allow modifying digital data within the network,
    which could create an immutable and actual environment for all transactions across
    the network (Radanović and Likić, 2018; Wu et al., 2017). The transparency of
    Blockchains is especially critical for tracking products along the supply chain
    as it enables users to read-only access to previous information and to inspect
    the content of smart contracts (Kshetri, 2018).

- en: JUSTIFICATION OF RESEARCH
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rationale behind doing this research is the provenance to achieve traceability,
    transparency and authenticity in the PSC. The current PSC are being increasingly
    complicated and heterogeneous as more internal and external stakeholders are involved.
    In this case, Information Technology (IT) has become and will continue to be an
    indispensable driving force for effective management of stakeholders across the
    supply chain (Rejeb, et al. 2019,). IT is capable of integrating internal processes,
    external vendors, as well as customers, therefore, the capability of acquiring,
    transmitting and communicating information within the supply chain network could
    be improved (Ben-Daya, Hassini and Bahroun, 2019). Hence, IoT and blockchain are
    the latest technologies. IoT could obtain real-time data to provide digital footprints
    (Ben-Daya, Hassini and Bahroun, 2019, Musamih et al., 2021), and Blockchain could
    provide better provenance with full traceability within the supply chain (Clauson
    et al., 2018). The application of IoT and blockchains could bring a paradigm shift
    in various areas of a PSC. So far, there is a lot of research related to blockchain
    or IoT application in a supply chain. For instance, an agricultural supply chain
    has achieved traceability by implementing blockchain (Kamble, Gunasekaran and
    Sharma, 2020, Sunny et al., 2020), while Walmart used blockchain to track food
    for better safety (Hyperledger, 2019). These literature reviews and case studies
    shows that IoT and blockchain application has a promising opportunity in information
    management and provenance in supply chains. But there is not much research focus
    on the IoT and blockchain application in the PSC. Therefore, this chapter would
    explore the application IoT and blockchain in PSC provenance to implement authenticity,
    traceability and transparency.

    (2003) indicated that the SLR method could help to guarantee collected literature
    falls within a specific research scope. At the same time, this method could help
    reviewers to mitigate the biases and imbalance when evaluating and synthesizing
    the contribution and findings of the studies. As such, the SLR can be considered
    as a useful methodology that could help the reviewer to collect and review studies
    around the topic from a wide range of databases. At the same time, it could provide

    criteria. It lays emphasis on quality control. The selected studies are highly
    correlated with the research topic. Articles were screened based on the publication
    year between 2010 to 2020 in the English language, and they are from full-text
    academically and scholarly (peer-reviewed) journals. At the same time, selected
    studies intend to include the papers that had been cited highly and the journals
    with high ranking in the academic field. After de-duplication and screening, the
    total number of articles for this review are 52\. The records of the outcomes

    articles. It is confirmed from the reviewed articles that the IoT and blockchain
    have enormous potential for resolving existing problems in the PSC and creating
    a traceable, transparent and authentic pharmaceutical supply environment. Before
    analyzing the thematic contribution, it would be helpful to understand the current
    challenges and problems in the current PSC. Therefore, this section would start
    with the findings related to traditional PSC followed by a discussion of findings
    categorized into two main themes, which are application and opportunities of IoT
    and blockchain technologies in PSC. Finally, the combination strategy of the IoT
    and blockchain is discussed in the context of PSC.

    for a long time. There are several published studies which defined this problem
    as an immense challenge in PSC (Sahoo et al., 2019; Dwivedi, Amin and Vollala,
    2020). Traceability is crucial in guaranteeing that the drugs have complied with
    the regulations and products are delivered to end customers safely (Dwivedi, Amin
    and Vollala, 2020). It is also the basis for customer confidence building in the
    pharmaceutical market (Chiacchio et al., 2019). However, Kim and Laskowski (2018)

    because of its inter-organizational nature. Furthermore, Srivastava et al. (2019)

    that drug traceability could be achieved by integrating IT systems from manufacturers
    to retailers. Although this practice is in compliance with the regulations related
    to traceability, however, there are some concerns in the adoption of such a system.
    Firstly, as Pandey and Litoriya (2020) mentioned, this is a centralized system
    that might occur as a single point of failure. Yong et al. (2020), Kumari and
    Saini (2020) also suggested the same opinion that the centralized information
    system is risky. At the same time, they underlined that data is highly prone to
    be deleted or tampered when the central server is attacked. Secondly, all the
    transactions data is stored in a database managed by a third-party that would
    decrease the privacy and reliability of records as the middleman could obtain
    and modify drug information easily (Huang, Wu and Long, 2018; Chitre et al., 2019).
    Thirdly, end-users are out of the system. According to the studies by Chitre et
    al. (2019) and Pandey (2020), the record processing usually starts from the manufacturer
    and end before reaching the end-users. Furthermore, manual operations are involved
    in current data collection and sharing mechanisms, where human error might occur
    (Ting et al., 2010). Hence, the present systems have some shortcomings including
    data security, data transparency, data transmission delays, poor compatibility
    of the IT systems. They could not meet the demand for tracking and tracing of
    drugs.

    Several publications indicated this problem, such as Tseng et al. (2018), Kumari
    and Saini (2020), as well as Dwivedi, Amin and Vollala (2020). Jamil et al. (2019)
    mentioned that low transparency related to information and transaction. The root
    cause of the low transparency is the absence of an appropriate information transmission
    system or mechanism. Currently, different enterprises might use different systems
    to record information, which would lead to a problem with compatibility (Dwivedi,
    Amin and Vollala, 2020). In this situation, it is hard to guarantee the integrity
    and timeliness of the information flow. The missing data, information asymmetry,
    or block would lead to a non-transparent supply chain (Tseng et al., 2018). In
    addition, although the development of information technology allows the integration
    of different kinds of IT system, but there is still a risk of poor product traceability.

    since there are gaps where fake drugs may be introduced into the market (Shi,
    Yi and Kuang, 2019; Abbas et al., 2020). At the same time, the low transparency
    in PSC would result in a low trust relationship between partners (Thaul, 2015;
    Jangir et al., 2019). Fernando, Meyliana and Surjandy (2019) emphasized on maintaining
    the trust relationship among different types of companies, which is consistent
    with the view of Dwivedi (2020), Chitre et al. (2019), and Ting et al. (2010).
    Lacking trust in PSC would greatly hinder cooperation and collaboration between
    partners.

    there are some monitoring technologies that have been suggested to collect data
    in recent years. Barcode, QR code, RFID are relatively mature identification technologies
    adopted in the PSC, despite their capabilities being somewhat limited (Barchetti
    et al., 2010; Papert, Rimpler and Pflaum, 2016a; Hasan et al., 2019). From previous
    literature, it could be seen that such identification technologies could help
    to offer a degree of information visibility and transparency in PSC but at the
    risks of privacy, wireless attacks, modifying and reusing of data (Jamil et al.,
    2019; Kumar and Tripathi, 2019; Dwivedi, Amin and Vollala, 2020).

    of product, which is disadvantageous for PSC (Ting et al., 2010). As for the read
    and write capability, data in the barcode and data matrix code is fixed. Both
    of these two techniques do not support adding further information at the drug
    level (Papert, Rimpler and Pflaum, 2016). Moreover, in the view of the read range,
    the barcode requires a laser beam to scan without any obstacles. The broken or
    polluted barcode could not be identified (Ting et al., 2010). On the other hand,
    RFID has more advantages, Ting et al. (2010) indicated that RFID allows the assignment
    of unique ID to each item, which is beneficial in tracking specific products.
    Furthermore, the read range of RFID technology is also longer than the barcode
    and is not limited by an obstacle. However, the popularity of the RFID system
    is not very high (Molina, Delgado and Tarazona, 2019). In addition, Raj, Rai and
    Agarwal (2019) and Kumar (2019) noted that RFID and QR code can be imitated and
    cloned easily with the growing skills and techniques, which also poses a threat
    to authenticity of data in PSC.

    Several publications documented that counterfeit and fake drug is a major threat
    to the pharmaceutical industry (Tseng et al., 2018; Jamil et al., 2019; Kumari
    and Saini, 2020; Pandey and Litoriya, 2020). It is prevalent in the developing
    countries and in the areas that lack strict surveillance (Sylim et al., 2018;
    Pandey and Litoriya, 2020). The quality of fictitious drugs is poor and non-standard,
    which would have a negative effect on consumer’s health (Abbas et al., 2020).
    At the same time, this kind of phenomenon would cause low public confidence in
    the effectiveness of the authentic drugs, influence the reputation of the companies
    in the PSC, as well as it leads to revenue losses of the medical company (Papert,
    Rimpler and Pflaum, 2016; Sahoo et al., 2019).

    and RFID have already been implemented in PSC, they could not prevent counterfeit
    drugs in the market and ensure the authenticity of the products effectively (Papert,

    tasks and each enterprise has its own information and IT system. Because of the
    IT system compatibility issue, participants of PSC exchange information through
    paper-based records. Another method is using a centralized database management
    by a third-party. Moreover, there is a possibility of fabrication and tampering
    of a centralized database maintained by an intermediary (Huang, Wu and Long, 2018).
    These potential risks pose a threat to authenticity and efficient government supervision,

    (2020), it requires the allocation of a unique serial number linked to drug production
    data such as batch number, production data and item identification code in the
    form of data matrix code, and then label the number on the drug package. With
    the unique identifier and the hierarchy matrix from the serialization software,
    the drug could be tracked from the outer to the inner package level. Currently,
    advanced technology enables operation machines to generate a serial number, print
    labels, packing automatically, as well as connect with the Internet to realize
    the IoT paradigm (Chiacchio et al., 2019, Jha et al., 2019).

    The role and functions of the serial number is similar to the information identifiers

    the serialisation system, a BC server would have to be developed for realizing
    the information transmission that facilitates the storage of the hierarchy matrix
    in the blockchain. Moreover, the interaction of servers and smart contracts would
    generate a QR code as the unique electronic identity for each drug. Similarly,
    the QR code would be labelled on the package of the corresponding drug. The system
    enables the final client to verify the authenticity of the drug by scanning the
    QR code on the package. The effectiveness of the system would already be confirmed

    to the drug package, and each sensor owns an address number. Sensor devices are
    placed at the appropriate point of the shipment. The temperature would be recorded
    by the sensor continuously and then stored in its database. The temperature data
    would be downloaded by scanning the tracking number on the drug package to connect
    the sensor, and then data could be sent to smart contracts. In this way, participants
    in the blockchain could verify the data. The approach could enhance regulatory
    compliance and guarantee quality control during transportation.

    drug transportation process to record and monitor the environment change. With
    continuous monitoring, the drug quality could be better guaranteed. The architectures
    were designed by Modum.io. The company provided a rough idea and method of combining
    IoT and blockchain in the PSC. However, it only focused on temperature monitoring,
    which is limited. In future studies and practice, researchers or companies could
    choose the right IoT sensor and blockchain platform to develop other functions
    such as humidity, location and other information monitoring in the transportation
    process based on this architecture.

    platforms, other models could also help to establish a connection and realize

    it is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Therefore, there
    are several challenges when applying the new integrated technology in the PSC.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some risks to the privacy and surety of IoT. Although several studies
    confirmed that IoT and blockchain applications could bring great advantages to
    PSC. With the sustained growth of IoT-based data sharing, a lack of regulation
    to enhance the governance of data sharing based on IoT might lead to high risks
    in security and privacy (Srivastava et al., 2019). Secondly, there are no policies
    to incentivize technology implementation (Sylim et al., 2018a).

    when all companies involved in the PSC are willing to participate in the network.
    So, making the blockchain accepted by the pharmaceutical industry and to promote
    the application is a challenging task (Huang, Wu and Long 2018; Srivastava et

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart contracts are the most advantageous application that could bring huge
    benefits to the supply chain. However, writing smart contracts faces some challenges.
    Firstly, the programming language of smart contracts is new, and it is hard to
    maintain. Secondly, the efficiency of transaction execution is low, reason being
    all transactions are executed amongst all the nodes (Sylim et al., 2018; Abbas
    et al., 2020).

    is required for the transaction to be executed. As a result the throughput of
    blockchain would negatively affect the efficiency of PSC (Zhou et al., 2019).

    to main challenges or issues in PSC. Three main challenges that are faced by PSC
    are poor traceability, low transparency, and lack of authenticity. Some of the
    problems as discussed in the review of complex PSC environment are different practices
    of enterprises, insufficient information management systems, unsatisfactory track
    and trace system, etc.'

    that IoT and blockchain application have on the aspect of information management
    and provenance in PSC. There is a short description of the existing IoT devices
    applied in PSC and the proposed blockchain system in this chapter. The publications
    on IoT and blockchain applications in current PSC showed potential opportunities.
    Nevertheless, most of the blockchain systems proposed by researchers lacked system
    effectiveness. The challenges discussed in the review include the aspects of regulation,
    expertise, as well as the acceptance of the pharmaceutical industry. All of these
    challenges would influence the effectiveness of implementing IoT and blockchain
    in the PSC.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Objective 3: An effort was made to achieve this objective by dividing it into
    2 parts which is the combination of IoT and Blockchain application in PSC and
    the suggested framework for integrating IoT and blockchain in PSC. Although developing
    blockchain for PSC management is still at the initial phase, multiple pieces of
    research have already demonstrated that the application of IoT and blockchain
    in PSC could provide a secure, authentic, reliable, trustworthy, immutable, traceable
    as well as tamper proof environment to support the PSC. That application could
    facilitate the collection of drug information, record and share information and
    transactions with involved participants in PSC. With the integral and reliable
    information flow, the transparency, traceability and authenticity of PSC could
    be improved effectively. Hence, problems such as counterfeit drugs and low trust
    relationships amongst partners of PSC could be resolved. For the IoT and blockchain
    integration, this chapter focused on the packaging process and transportation
    process. More importantly, this chapter provides a rough basic framework of IoT
    and blockchain combination structure in PSC based on the review of existing studies,
    which presents the essential models when combining IoT and blockchain.'

- en: The findings of this study must be seen in the light of following limitations.
    Firstly, the sample size and the number of academic literatures used for the review.
    As blockchain and IoT integration technology are still in the initial phase, there
    is limited research done on this topic. Therefore, the number of selected academic
    peer-reviewed journals, journal papers and conference papers are unbalanced. Furthermore,
    the ranking of most selected scholarly papers is unspecific. Secondly, there were
    only few articles related to the implementation of IoT and blockchain in the drug
    transportation process, which might be because IoT and blockchain application
    is still in the initial phase. Finally, the framework provided in this chapter
    is by combining IoT and Blockchain in PSC. It is composed of six modules. (1)
    IoT module, (2) Application module, (3) Certificate authority, (4) Transaction
    private module, (5) Smart contract module, and (6) Fabric blockchain. Further
    research should be conducted to simulate the framework, enabling a stepped approach
    towards best practice.
