- en: 'All stock investors are familiar with the abbreviation IPO (Initial Public
    Offering), which means the initial public offering of stocks. The buyers of stocks
    become co-owners of the company, and the company itself gets money from sales,
    usually exceeding its annual returns. Recently, a similar abbreviation has come
    into existence in the cryptocurrency community: ICO, or Initial Coin Offering.'

- en: An IPO is a legitimate (legally speaking) operation. A company with an existing
    and maturing business structure launches an IPO to attract funding. Raising funds
    through selling shares is the cheapest way to do this. At the same time, launching
    an IPO is a very expensive process. For a company to enter the exchange, it must
    meet many requirements, including the volume of capitalization and undergo an
    audit. In addition, the company should attract underwriters who will sell the
    company’s shares. Then there’s getting the word out, attracting money and investors,
    and then the company will start to trade its shares on the stock exchange. That’s
    why it is a long and expensive process.

    and because of this, many people press the panic button, thinking if they do not
    buy these coins now, they will have to buy this currency later but at a higher
    price.

- en: Both IPOs and the ICOs are risky ways to make money, but they can also be very
    profitable. People participate in ICOs hoping to make a quick buck. And as soon
    as these people earn their money back, they immediately withdraw them. That's
    why the coins first zoom up sharply and then go down in price when people start
    to sell them. This is one of the strategies the speculators use.

- en: In contrast to ICOs, such speculations are rather rare in IPO because of the
    so-called "lock-up period." People, who bought shares before the IPO cannot sell
    them until three months later. With ICOs, you can buy coins even during the pre-ICO
    stage.

- en: Let’s summarize why so many people take the risk of investing in ICOs. Some
    invest money in these projects simply to support them, while other people will
    quickly buy and quickly sell, and the third group of people makes the investment
    because they read about the project somewhere or, even worse, want to duplicate
    the success of their friends.

    Minimum Viable Product (MVP). They have only an idea. Most of these startups are
    increasingly showing signs of pyramid schemes, namely: you are assured that if
    you invest money at the first stage your investments will be doubled already at
    the second stage and will grow fourfold at the third stage. In other words, investors
    are offered a sort of game, so that they get the impression of being able to get
    rich quick.'

    official crowdsale or ICO campaign goes live. This event is typically held to
    raise funds for marketing, particularly to pay for a PR campaign during the ICO.
    In other words, it sounds like this: "We raise money for advertising to arrange
    an even greater promotion later and collect money again."'

- en: In addition some ICOs have will stop to declare that a number (more) of funds
    is needed for the actual project implementation, so the largest possible sum is
    collected from the market. This is how sometimes people create a company with
    a capitalization of billions of dollars.

    many transactions. To date, IOTA is valued at almost $2 billion. But there is
    one catch. The company promises nothing and owns nothing (except for the site
    of course). That is, by and large, people value the design of the company’s site
    at almost $2 billion! It’s not a good investment, is it?

    to participate in them can really make a good profit. However, all such ICOs still
    have the one and same fate, and it can be compared with an elevator: when it is
    full, it cannot go up. So there is a huge amount of speculative money in such
    ICOs; every price surge makes these people sell everything, close their positions,
    and thereby exert pressure on the stocks.'

    are deceptive. In fact, I just want to show you that most of these startups are
    very overrated and only 2% -3% of them survive.

- en: To profit from ICOs, you must, first and foremost, understand why you’re investing
    in it. So the reason for your transaction entry should be equal to the reason
    for the exit. If you participate in an ICO simply because you believe in a future
    product, then it is probably not the smartest decision. First, let the company
    enter the market and start to trade. If you still believe in its product, then
    you can always buy it, even at a discount, some time later.

    of them booms. To be frank, I have a separate list of all dropping ICOs, and I
    keep track each of them every day. I am ready to buy them for some disposal value.
    For example, 10% of the placing price. In this case, I will gladly make a purchase,
    for example, at $1,000, and thus my risk will be the same $1,000.

- en: 'The next tip: many people think that if the price starts to go down, it is
    a sign of bankruptcy and you need to run away. And vice versa: if the price grows,
    you need to buy. In fact, everything works the other way round. Falling market
    is the best opportunity for identifying strong and weak coins and tokens. Track
    whether the volume of coin increases when it falls. If it increases, that''s good.
    If the coin price drops and the volume does not increase, it means there is no
    demand for these coins, and a seller constantly has to lower the price.'

    you may participate these ICOs too. You read right. You may do it to make a profit
    on greedy and ill-informed people. In a certain way, this also proves that ICO
    is a legal pyramid scheme, and your task is to enter it and leave it as soon as
    possible.

    capitalization. If the ICO capitalization is about $500 million, it’s okay. However,
    if you multiply the value of a token by the number of all tokens known in advance
    and get the capitalization of $5 billion, this gives pause for thought. You can
    also compare capitalization of the ICO you are interested in with a previous ICO.
    When comparing, pay attention not to the value of one token but to the capitalization
    of the whole company.

    not from the exchange.
