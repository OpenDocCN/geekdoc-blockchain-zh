- en: English poet Samuel T. Coleridge wrote “O! lady, we receive but what we give?
    And nature alone lives in our lives.” The Earth is one, but nations are not. New
    technology, especially blockchain paves the way toward a global village. This
    chapter analyses the ultimate solution to the global warming issue through the
    introduction of green currency based on blockchain technology to inculcate the
    concept of environmental protection in the next generation. We never value the
    free gifts of nature as the economies are driven by markets globally. Unless and
    until a monetary value is associated with environmental protection it’s difficult
    to motivate the next generation to protect it. The introduction of green currency
    helps in creating a market. Development with the acceptance, protection, and maintenance
    of nature as it is is possible only through the use of advanced technologies.
    This chapter introduces a new concept of global green currency based on blockchain
    technology. This tool may ultimately present a platform as a solution to the global
    warming issue.

    truly global in the sense that it affects and also is accountable for not one
    or two countries, but the entire human race. According to the World Health Organization
    (WHO), climate change causes at least 150,000 fatalities every year, with that
    number anticipated to quadruple by 2030 (Paritosh [Kasotia, n.d.](#r10)). Global
    warming will have disastrous health implications. We''ve been working on it for
    a long time, but we haven''t been able to come to an agreement since different
    countries have different objectives and instruments for dealing with the problem.
    Nobody is attempting to focus on a market-based solution to instill environmentally
    conscious habits in the next generation. We may redesign the economic system by
    introducing the concept of green currency, which naturally assigns value to the
    environment by re-establishing nature-human connectivity ([Acheampong et al.,

    the data? What is the Unit of GA? What is its value? What is the value of a tree,
    a water body, a forest area, green fields, or a river? The objective to calculate
    GA is to create a mechanism so that the development process continues/ sustains
    without harming the environment. To evaluate the value for GA, there might be
    a guiding principle of how much CO[2] or GHGs absorbed or how much O[2] is generated,
    by the asset? The unit of the GA might be Green Coin (GC) as an Environment Unit
    (EU). The valuation of GA is a cumbersome method as there is a need to assign
    value to each and every asset or activity scientifically, according to CO[2] absorption
    or O[2] generation at the global level. There must be a Modus Operandi or a protocol
    to assess the value of the. In the coming census, we can design a calculator also
    so that the enumerators can easily evaluate the GA possessed by an individual,
    an institution, an enterprise, or the government(Kailashi punit D., Kamal Hiran,
    2021).

    and species ([Teskey et al., 2008](#r21)). It also varies with tree growth which
    again depends upon various factors. According to Eco Tree on an average 10 -40
    kg of CO2 are absorbed per tree per year by a tree. A methodology based on Winrock
    International Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR), uses a carbon storage calculator
    to calculate this(onetreeplanted.org). On an average tree absorbs 10kg per year
    for the first 20 years. Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) activities are being
    implemented around the world to improve the ecological and economic productivity
    of degraded lands([Berck & Helfand, 2005](#r4)). Charl De Villers ([de Villiers
    et al., 2014](#r6)) goes further and calculates the carbon sequestration capacity
    of a tree according to its age. In a case study, he states that the tree volume
    increases slowly during the first 10 years and then increases dramatically during
    10-40 years, and then stabilizes. He finds that the relationship between carbon
    sequestration and tree volume is the same as tree volume and tree age. Apart from
    this our oceans are a great source of O2 and Carbon sequestration. Great whales
    and phytoplankton play a major role ([Roman et al., 2014](#r19)). Each great whale
    sequesters 33 tons of CO2 on an average, a thousand times a tree. Phytoplankton
    captures about 40% of all CO2 produced by us and contributes to at least 50% of
    all oxygen in our atmosphere. While valuing we cannot ignore our oceans and various
    creatures on this planet. On the basis of the above studies, we can assign an
    Environment Unit value to a green area or forest area on the basis of its capacity
    to absorb CO2\. Suppose government wishes to build a dam then the cost of construction
    will also include the cost of GA depleted, in EU assigned to the above calculations.
    Suppose this project needs to cut down 100 trees aging 40 years or more then this
    will cost about losing the opportunity of 4000 kg CO2 sequestration capacity forever.
    This is alarming as this can’t be compensated instantly. If the authority plants
    the same number of trees somewhere then this will take the next 40 years to achieve
    this capacity level assuming a 100% survival rate. So, this needs to be compensated
    if and only if the government purchases the same capacity from stakeholders viz
    households, institutions, or other countries. By this logic, we can build an eco-system
    for Sustainable Development ([Dadhich et al., 2021](#r5)).

    For example, a tree at 10 years of age absorbs 10 kg CO2 per year is equivalent
    to suppose 10 EU. This might change with age and species. For every project, this
    must carefully be assessed and GA should be compensated with GA only, then only
    we can achieve the net-zero target.

    forests include not only covered tree area but also ecological and irreversible
    nature. So, if and only if one pays environment units (EU) then only, we can ensure
    ecological balance globally. This policy will surely balance the economy and environment.

    distributed database, typically a blockchain, which acts as a public financial
    ledger. This database does not reside on a single machine, but rather on a network
    of interconnected computers (called “nodes”) that constantly share and update
    data with one another.

    included in each block and is managed by supercomputers. Because everyone in the
    network has access to the same information, consensus has been reached as to its
    veracity, making this validation process based on consensus. What we need is a
    system that allows information to be stored in discrete chunks, linked together
    so that it can be accessed and verified quickly and easily whenever needed.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A green currency system can offer a number of benefits to society. The first
    is that it will be easier for the world to achieve sustainability. Secondly, it
    will create a more equitable economic system. Thirdly, it will reduce the risk
    of inflation and economic crashes. Fourthly, it would allow people to take care
    of their own needs without relying on others. Fifth and finally, it would help
    create a more cooperative society.

- en: First and foremost, there is a need to establish value in the environmental
    assets that are utterly overlooked by society owing to ignorance. The new virtual
    green currency based on blockchain technology has the potential to play a key
    role in the development of a market for green currency based on environmental
    green assets. This paper suggests one technology-based method to evaluate green
    assets and establish a market for green currencies. There are various other technologies
    also available to verify data captured and asset valuation. i.e. GPS. If this
    happens, it will certainly have a long-term impact on individual and societal
    behavior when it comes to the proper use of natural resources. In fact, by not
    assigning a monetary value to green assets, we are undervaluing the efforts of
    people who are devoted to preserving them for a long-ago, particularly the primitives.
