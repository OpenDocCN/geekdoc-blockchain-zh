    media company where I worked. A black stretch limo, sleek as a hot buttered dolphin,
    rounded the corner and drove up to us.

    birthday!”

    young technology professionals riding high on the dot-com bubble.

    limo. Our company had recently gone public on the New York Stock Exchange, and
    everyone was celebrating: party hats, champagne . . . There was a platter of oysters
    perched precariously on a seat, and when my friend and coworker Genevieve climbed
    in, she accidentally sat on them.'

    Gen.

    He handed me a drink.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Beer with a shot of whiskey!” Chris responded cheerfully. “Boilermakers for
    everyone!” He stuck his head out the sunroof as the limo pulled out. “Boilermakers
    for Boston!” He grabbed a handful of shrimp and tossed them at an innocent pedestrian.
    The limo erupted in laughter.

    to see that comedy hypnotist?”

    a donkey?”

    with a handful of napkins.

    while pretending not to. I did some quick mental math and had one of the greatest
    shocks of my life.

- en: I was a millionaire.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: True, it was just on paper; I didn’t have a million dollars in cash. I had stock
    options worth a million dollars. That meant if I stayed with the company another
    year and the stock price stayed at $19, I could then sell the stock, making a
    million dollars in the trade.

    this to ourselves. Suddenly a dam exploded, and the limo erupted in cheers. “Woo-hoo!”
    yelled Chris, lighting up a Roman candle and firing it out the sunroof. FOOM.

    FOOM.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I looked over at Jade. I knew she had already made the same calculations, probably
    figuring in tax and depreciation. She had also mentally run several what-if scenarios
    with best-case, worst-case, and likely-case stock prices in a year, when we could
    cash out. We shared a kiss.

    “Limos for everyone!”

    I had grown up in a middle-class neighborhood in Ohio, then moved to Boston to
    become a comedy writer. I wasn’t born into wealth or privilege; my trust fund
    was a Honda Civic. Now I was a millionaire riding in a limo?

    to share my thirtieth birthday with you, the people I love so much, doing the

    wife I love so much. A toast to health, wealth, and happiness.”

    you.” I drained my boilermaker and leaned back with my arm around the love of
    my life. Nerds were cool, the Internet was hot, and new media was the new black.
    Surely, I thought, this is the greatest time to be alive.

    of the mic. I grabbed it from him, and he chased me as I weaved my way through
    the other volunteers, who legitimately thought they were donkeys. “Hee-haw,” I
    said, lightly touching each one on the head as I ran by. “Hee-haw. Hee-haw.”
