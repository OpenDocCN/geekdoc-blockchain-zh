  zh: 3.1 引言
- en: Blockchain technology—along with its main applications, namely cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts—has attracted a great deal of attention and stimulated rich
    discussions among academics, practitioners and regulators around the world. It
    is now acknowledged as a disruptive force in the financial sector and can undermine
    the traditional business models and technologies that are currently employed in
    many key financial service transactions. As Philippon ([2016](#CR35), p. 2) notes,
    “such innovations can disrupt existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries,
    facilitate strategic disintermediation, revolutionize how existing firms create
    and deliver products and services, provide new gateways for entrepreneurship,
    democratize access to financial services, but also create significant privacy,
    regulatory and law enforcement challenges”.

    p. 2)，“这样的创新可能会打破现有的行业结构，模糊行业边界，促进战略去中介化，彻底改变现有企业创造和提供产品和服务的方式，为创业提供新的途径，使金融服务的获取民主化，但也创造了重大的隐私、监管和执法挑战”。

    processes underlying the financial services offer, thereby fostering the offer
    of higher-quality services. It may also allow the entry of new operators with
    a consequent expansion of the competitive context. However, like any emerging
    technology, blockchain’s potential implications are both far-reaching and not

  zh: 3.2 区块链对银行的潜在风险
- en: With regard to blockchain’s potential implications for banks, it is worth noting
    that the first-generation blockchain (Blockchain 1.0.)—that is, blockchain used
    to support Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies)^([3](#Fn3))—was initially designed
    as a platform for disintermediation (Martino [2019](#CR28)). Its main purpose
    was to create an electronic payment system to allow the direct transfer of value
    between two parties without the need for a trusted third party (a central authority
    or an intermediary like a bank). Disintermediation means the blockchain linked
    to cryptocurrencies eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks because
    it enables individuals and organisations to transact and forge agreements directly
    with one another without risks. In this way, banks are no longer needed to verify
    the parties’ identities, establish trust or perform critical activities like the
    contracting, clearing, settling and record-keeping of tasks (McDonald et al. [2016](#CR27);
    Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR19); Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR21)).

  zh: 关于区块链对银行潜在影响，值得注意的是，第一代区块链（Blockchain 1.0）——即用于支持比特币（和其他加密货币）^([3](#Fn3))——最初被设计为去中介化平台（马提诺[2019](#CR28)）。其主要目的是创建一种电子支付系统，允许两方直接转移价值，无需信任第三方（中央机构或银行等中介）。去中介化意味着与加密货币相关的区块链消除了银行等中介的需求，因为它使个人和组织能够直接进行交易和协议，而无需承担风险。这样一来，银行不再需要验证各方身份、建立信任或执行合同、清算、结算和记录任务等关键活动（麦克唐纳等[2016](#CR27)；霍洛缇乌克等[2017](#CR19)；伊安西蒂和拉克哈尼[2017](#CR21)）。
- en: In theory, first-generation blockchain poses a threat to the banking industry
    since blockchain and Bitcoin (as well as other cryptocurrencies), taken together,
    are tools for disintermediating banks. According to McDonald et al. ([2016](#CR27)),
    blockchain can be considered a new institutional technology that might re-order
    the governance of the production of banking services since it enables bank transactions
    to move away from centralised hierarchical organisations towards a decentralised
    market.

  zh: 从理论上讲，第一代区块链对银行业构成威胁，因为区块链和比特币（以及其他加密货币）一起，是去中介化银行的工具。根据麦克唐纳等人（[2016](#CR27)），区块链可以被视为一种可能重新定义银行服务生产治理的新机构技术，因为它使银行交易从集中的等级组织向去中心化市场转移。
- en: Today, transferring value in a final way requires a long process with numerous
    players (e.g. customers, banks, clearing systems, settlement systems and so on)
    working on a SWIFT network,^([4](#Fn4)) which banks use to transfer all types
    of financial information. To move money effectively, several centralised systems
    act as a “notary” of the transaction, making it a very long and complex process.
    Via blockchain, in conjunction with Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), this
    process can take place in a direct, secure and “final” way without the involvement
    of the players mentioned above. Specifically, owing to the key characteristics
    of the distributed ledger technology (see Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)),
    blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies makes it possible for two people who do
    not know each other to directly exchange digital assets in a secure and “final”
    way. This means that, at the end of the transaction, there is an effective ownership
    transfer (Martino [2019](#CR28)).

  zh: 今天，以最终方式转移价值需要通过一个漫长的流程，其中涉及到众多参与者（例如客户、银行、清算系统、结算系统等）在SWIFT网络上进行交易，^([4](#Fn4))银行使用该网络来转移各种类型的金融信息。为了有效移动资金，几个中心化系统充当交易的“公证人”，使其成为一个非常漫长和复杂的流程。通过区块链，结合比特币（以及其他加密货币），这个过程可以直接、安全地并“最终”地进行，而无需涉及上述参与者。具体来说，由于分布式账本技术的关键特征（见[第2章](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)），区块链与加密货币使得两个互相不认识的人可以以直接、安全和“最终”的方式交换数字资产。这意味着，在交易结束时，存在着有效的所有权转让（Martino[2019](#CR28)）。
- en: Based on the considerations above, first-generation blockchain can be considered
    a new player that competes with banks, since blockchain and cryptocurrencies facilitate
    new tools that can be deployed to manage the difficulties of transacting (MacDonald
    et al. [2016](#CR27); Lindman et al. [2017](#CR26); Frame et al. [2018](#CR15)),
    and they offer significant advantages over banks in several areas (e.g. payments)
    by allowing a fast, low-cost and secure way to transfer value. These advantages,
    as explained above, are associated with the elimination of intermediaries in transactions
    and the consequent banking fees. Furthermore, new blockchain-based start-ups (i.e.
    so-called fintech companies) may emerge and offer some banking services with lower
    fees, thus potentially causing banks to lose their market share (Philippon [2016](#CR35);
    Stulz [2019](#CR41)). For instance, many fintech start-ups are active today in
    segments of the value chain that are already managed by banks, such as business
    and consumer lending (PwC [2020](#CR37)). Such firms leverage blockchain technology
    to offer credits and funding to individuals and businesses with lower transaction
    costs; thus, they compete with traditional commercial banks. In this way, blockchain
    and cryptocurrencies may jeopardise one of the banking sector’s core business
    activities (i.e. lending), with the consequent erosion of bank revenue, thus undermining
    the banks’ profitability (Yeoh [2017](#CR44)). According to Gartner ([2018](#CR17)),
    one of the world’s leading research and advisory companies, 80% of heritage financial
    services firms will go out of business by 2030, become commoditised or exist only
    formally without competing effectively. The reason for this is that global digital
    platforms, fintech companies and other players will gain greater market share
    by using emerging technologies, such as blockchain, to change the industry’s economic
    and business models.

  zh: 基于上述考虑，第一代区块链可以被视为与银行竞争的新参与者，因为区块链和加密货币可以促进部署用于解决交易困难的新工具（MacDonald等[2016](#CR27);
    Lindman等[2017](#CR26); Frame等[2018](#CR15)），并且在几个领域（例如支付）比银行提供了显著的优势，允许了一种快速、低成本和安全的价值转移方式。如上所述，这些优势与消除交易中介和随之而来的银行费用有关。此外，新的基于区块链的初创公司（即所谓的金融科技公司）可能会出现，并以更低的费用提供某些银行服务，从而潜在地导致银行失去市场份额（Philippon
    [2016](#CR35); Stulz [2019](#CR41)）。例如，许多金融科技初创公司如今在由银行管理的价值链中的一些领域活跃，例如企业和消费者放贷（PwC
    [2020](#CR37)）。这些公司利用区块链技术以更低的交易成本向个人和企业提供信贷和资金，因此它们与传统商业银行竞争。通过这种方式，区块链和加密货币可能危及银行部门的核心业务活动之一（即放贷），从而导致银行收入的削弱，从而损害银行的盈利能力（Yeoh[2017](#CR44)）。根据全球领先的研究和咨询公司Gartner（[2018](#CR17)）的数据显示，到2030年，80%的传统金融服务公司将倒闭、成为商品化，或仅以形式存在而无法有效竞争。其原因在于全球数字平台、金融科技公司和其他参与者将利用新兴技术，如区块链，改变行业的经济和商业模式，从而获得更大的市场份额。
- en: Today, the largest banks acknowledge the potential risks posed by this new competitor.
    In its annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released
    in February 2019, the Bank of America Corporation (BofA) listed cryptocurrencies
    among the risk factors that could have an impact on the bank’s competitiveness
    and reduce its revenues and profits. BofA reported that technological advances
    (such as cryptocurrencies) have enabled new players to offer products and services
    that had traditionally been banking products, as well as new innovative products,
    at a lower price, thereby increasing competition, which, in turn, may harm bank
    earnings through several channels. For instance, BofA points out that these new
    technologies create pressure on banks to lower the prices of—or the credit standards
    applied to—their products and services, require substantial expenditures to modify
    or adapt existing products and services in order to stay competitive and affect
    the willingness of customers to do business with banks. This can reduce banks’
    net interest margin and revenues from their fee-based products and services. This
    view is also supported by the large US bank JPMorgan Chase, which acknowledged
    in its annual 10-K filing that payment processing and other banking services could
    be significantly disrupted by new technologies like cryptocurrencies. It pointed
    out how these technologies require that banks make additional investments for
    them to remain competitive and can put pressure on the pricing of banks’ products
    and services or cause the bank to lose market share, particularly as far as traditional
    banking products like deposits and bank accounts are concerned. According to JPMorgan
    Chase, any such impact could reduce the bank’s revenues and profitability.

- en: 'Regulation issues are among the most important problems limiting the application
    of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies at present since the banking sector is
    highly regulated, while blockchain and cryptocurrencies are, for the most part,
    not (yet). For instance, for issues related to terrorism and tax avoidance, among
    others, banks must track transactions step by step, which is not always feasible
    with first-generation blockchain, thus raising issues related to transaction traceability.
    As Houben and Snyers ([2018](#CR20)) argue, cryptocurrencies are thought to be
    very suitable for illicit activities given their anonymity, cross-border nature
    and quick transferability. The anonymity, in particular, which can vary from complete
    anonymity to pseudo-anonymity, prevents cryptocurrency transactions from being
    adequately monitored, thus allowing transactions to occur outside the regulatory
    perimeter and, consequently, enabling individuals to use cryptocurrencies for
    their unlawful actions. Therefore, regulators around the world are worried about
    criminals increasingly using cryptocurrencies to commit fraud and manipulation,
    tax evasion, hacking and money laundering or to fund terrorist activities, and
    they are trying to overcome such problems by regulating cryptocurrencies (see
    Chapter [5](490216_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml)). Another set of issues relates to privacy:
    in a simple transaction between two subjects, only the parties that participated
    in the operation (e.g. customers, banks, the central bank and the clearing system)
    have access to information about the transaction; by contrast, with public blockchain,
    everyone can access this information and see that one person has sent money to
    another. Also, as explained in Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml), the transparency
    inherent in public blockchain is such that anyone can retrieve the history of
    all transactions performed on a blockchain and rely on big data analytics to retrieve
    potentially sensitive information (De Filippi [2016](#CR10)). These regulatory
    problems currently limit the application of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies
    as a potential competitor to banks in areas like payment and lending. This, in
    turn, reduces the resulting risks to banks’ core business and profitability.'

  zh: 目前，监管问题是限制区块链与加密货币应用的最重要问题之一，因为银行业受到高度监管，而区块链和加密货币在很大程度上还未受到监管。举例来说，出于恐怖主义和逃税等问题，银行必须逐步跟踪交易，而第一代区块链未能完全做到这一点，因此引发了与交易可追踪性相关的问题。正如豪彬和斯尼尔斯（[2018](#CR20)）所言，鉴于其匿名性、跨境性和快速转移性，人们认为加密货币非常适合进行非法活动。特别是匿名性，可以从完全匿名到伪匿名不等，阻止了对加密货币交易进行充分监管，从而允许交易在监管范围之外进行，使个人能够利用加密货币进行非法活动。因此，世界各地的监管机构担心犯罪分子越来越多地使用加密货币进行欺诈和操纵、逃税、黑客攻击和洗钱，或者用来资助恐怖主义活动，并试图通过对加密货币进行监管来解决这些问题（请参阅第[5](490216_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml)章）。另一套问题涉及隐私：在两个主体之间进行简单交易时，只有参与交易的各方（例如客户、银行、中央银行和清算系统）可以访问有关交易的信息；相反，公共区块链可以让任何人访问这些信息，看到一个人向另一个人汇款的情况。此外，正如第[2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)章所解释的，公共区块链固有的透明性意味着任何人都可以检索区块链上进行的所有交易历史，并依靠大数据分析来检索潜在的敏感信息（De
    Filippi [2016](#CR10)）。这些监管问题目前限制了区块链与加密货币作为支付和贷款领域银行潜在竞争者的应用，从而减少了对银行核心业务和盈利能力的风险。
- en: Finally, other problems that limit the use of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies
    and, consequently, reduce the potential risks for banks concern scalability and
    the high volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Regarding scalability
    problems, as explained in Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml), public blockchain
    on which cryptocurrencies operate can process only four to seven operations per
    second, while traditional systems today carry out even thousands of operations
    per second, thus making the latter more convenient than blockchain. The high volatility
    of cryptocurrencies generates problems relating to exchange rates with fiat currencies
    and the consequent foreign exchange risks.

- en: Thus, activities such as securities transactions, where post-trade clearing
    and settlement is slow and expensive and involves many parties, may benefit from
    the adoption of blockchain (Yermack [2019](#CR45)), which can securely and transparently
    move securities in seconds or minutes, with automatic clearing and settlement
    (Buithenek [2016](#CR5)). As a consequence, this would lead to reduced costs and
    lower counterparty risk associated with clearing and settlement (McKinsey & Company
    [2016](#CR29)). Several transactions have demonstrated the blockchain’s impact
    on capital markets. For instance, in April 2019, Société Générale SFH, a subsidiary
    of Société Générale Group, issued €100 million in covered bonds as a security
    token directly registered on the Ethereum blockchain, exploring a more efficient
    process for bond issuances by reducing costs and the number of intermediaries
    involved. Subsequently, in September 2019, Banco Santander issued the first end-to-end
    blockchain bond (worth $20 million) using the public Ethereum blockchain, which
    allowed the bank to tokenise the bond securely (i.e. digitally represent traditional
    assets on the blockchain) and register it in a permissioned manner on the blockchain.
    The automation of the entire process enabled the bank to reduce the number of
    intermediaries required in the process, making the transaction faster, simpler
    and more efficient.

- en: Another activity in this area covers syndicated loans, which take on average
    around 20 days for a transaction to be settled by the banks due to the quantity
    of information exchanged, lengthy reviews and the paper forms of communication
    between parties (Fanning and Centers [2016](#CR14)). Blockchain may reduce the
    time and costs for the transaction by automating the entire process and making
    it more transparent. First, when a party enters contract information into the
    blockchain, information is made available in real time to all other parties, thus
    removing the need for paper communications and multiple contract reviews. Also,
    smart contracts can be used to digitise the syndicated loan to reconcile trades
    against credit agreements, automatically debit interest payments from the borrower’s
    account and adjust loan liability within the blockchain. As Rutenberg and Wenner
    ([2017](#CR38)) suggest, by using smart contacts, it is possible to manage the
    entire process—from entering into the loan contract and collecting interest payments
    to calling a default and even seizing collateral—without any human involvement.
    This can reduce the need for manual reconciliations and processing, which can
    result in time and cost savings. For instance, in 2018, Spain’s BBVA and two partner
    banks (MUFG of Japan and BNP Paribas of France) completed the first syndicated
    loan (to the tune of €150 million) on blockchain with the Red Eléctrica corporation,
    thus providing a working example of how such transactions can be simplified and
    accelerated by using blockchain technology. The whole negotiation process was
    done over a private blockchain network, which significantly expedited the process
    while ensuring full documentation tracking and negotiation transparency.

    Rutenberg and Wenner （[2017](#CR38)）所建议的那样，通过使用智能合同，有可能在没有任何人员介入的情况下管理整个流程——从签署贷款合同和收取利息支付到宣告违约甚至查封抵押物。这可以减少手工对账和处理的需求，从而节省时间和成本。例如，在
    2018 年，西班牙的 BBVA 和两家伙伴银行（日本的 MUFG 和法国的 BNP Paribas）与 Red Eléctrica 公司完成了首笔区块链辨认贷款交易（金额为1.5

    in a more easily verifiable and decentralised manner to increase the speed of
    transactions and reduce the need for paper reconciliation (FSB [2019](#CR16)).
    For instance, in May 2018, HSBC and ING Bank completed the world’s first commercially
    viable trade finance transaction for the international food and agriculture conglomerate
    Cargill by using blockchain (specifically, R3’s scalable Corda blockchain platform).
    HSBC issued a letter of credit to ING for the firm Cargill and executed the transaction

    is a time-consuming task for the financial institutions and regulators who have
    to process such vast amounts of information. Blockchain could significantly reduce
    the costs associated with such operations. It may simplify all administrative
    work involved in the compliance process since with blockchain a transaction is
    automatic, and then it automatically feeds the compliance database. For instance,
    Buithenek ([2016](#CR5)) suggests that blockchain, by enabling smart contracts,

    a transaction, thereby dramatically reducing the time and effort that financial
    institutions spend on regulatory reporting and improving the quality, accuracy
    and speed of the entire process. As a result, it will also reduce the costs involved.
    This means that compliance can work in real time concerning the payment process
    (and, in general, any banking activity), improve the speed of processes and reduce
    the related costs. Furthermore, blockchain may be used to keep track of the steps
    that regulations require: immutably recording transactions on the distributed
    ledger, which renders information decentralised and accessible, provides a comprehensive,
    secure and irreversible financial audit trail for regulators to verify compliance,
    thus eliminating the need for regulators to collect, store, reconcile and aggregate
    information. By allowing regulators and central banks to independently extract
    information on transactions, banks may avoid all the administrative work, which

    all the benefits mentioned above. For instance, regarding the benefits identified

    regulatory issues (e.g. relating to privacy and security, like the General Data
    Protection Regulation or GDPR^([6](#Fn6))) that may constrain the use of blockchain
    technology in these banking processes. In KYC processes, for example, privacy
    issues must be addressed before adopting blockchain, since customers must first
    authorise the sharing of their data between banks. Thus, it is necessary to address
    these issues before adopting blockchain in these areas. Moreover, there is the
    problem of the progressive adoption of blockchain and the resulting standardisation
    to allow for interoperability, that is, the ability to share information without
    restrictions across different blockchain networks (Casey et al. [2018](#CR8)).
    Specifically, different blockchain systems will need to be interoperable with
    other ledgers and integrated with existing systems if they are to be introduced

    standardisation is vital to improving interoperability between blockchains, applications
    built on the same blockchain, and between blockchains and legacy IT systems, thereby
    facilitating the establishment of blockchain-based ecosystems. This means that
    the involvement of the entire banking system is essential: it becomes profitable
    to use blockchain only if all banks adopt the same methodology to transmit information.
    Then, it is necessary to have collaboration across industries (i.e. other financial
    institutions, such as insurance or non-financial companies) and along the value

    GDPR^([6](#Fn6)）），可能会限制区块链技术在这些银行业务流程中的使用。例如，在KYC流程中，在采用区块链之前必须解决隐私问题，因为客户必须首先授权银行之间共享他们的数据。因此，在这些领域采用区块链之前，有必要解决这些问题。此外，还存在着渐进采用区块链和相应标准化的问题，以实现互操作性，即在不同的区块链网络之间自由共享信息的能力（Casey等人[2018](#CR8)）。具体来说，不同的区块链系统需要与其他分类帐互通，并与现有系统整合，如果它们要大规模引入金融系统。正如穆迪's所述（[2019](#CR30)），标准化对于改善区块链、建立在相同区块链上的应用程序以及区块链和传统IT系统之间的互操作性至关重要，从而促进基于区块链的生态系统的建立。这意味着整个银行系统的参与至关重要：只有在所有银行采用相同的方法来传输信息时，使用区块链才会有利润。因此，有必要在跨行业间（如保险或非金融公司等其他金融机构）和价值链上进行合作，以便广泛采用区块链，并利用其好处。

- en: Data is a key source to build up information that can provide the firm with
    a competitive advantage (Prescott [2016](#CR36)). Since information on customer
    payments and credit profiles represents a source of knowledge about customers
    for banks, banks may utilise this information as a key resource to generate new
    products and services in order to better address customer needs (Martino [2019](#CR28)).
    Nevertheless, the key advantage for banks is the ability to access numerous and
    diversified kinds of information—relating not only to the bank (e.g. information
    on customers) but also to other organisations such as ships, ports and so on and
    their resulting exploitation—to create new products and services that do not exist
    yet. The availability of a series of distributed information derived from a variety
    of sources gives banks a better and more complete understanding of their customers’
    behaviours, needs and preferences (Prescott [2016](#CR36)), which enables banks
    to create and offer products and services tailored to these customers’ individual
    needs.

    [2019](#CR28)）。然而，对于银行来说，关键优势在于能够获取各种各样的信息，不仅涉及银行（例如客户信息），还涉及其他组织，如船舶、港口等，以及它们的利用，以创造尚不存在的新产品和服务。来自多种来源的分布信息的可获得性使银行对客户行为、需求和偏好有了更好、更全面的理解（Prescott

    eligibility and due diligence requirements to formally open an account. Additional

    by addressing their needs and solving most of the abovementioned challenges (Natarajan
    et al. [2017](#CR32); Lichtfous et al. [2018](#CR25); Schuetz and Venkatesh [2020](#CR40)).
    First, banks can reach these individuals by allowing them to create their own
    financial alternatives (e.g. cryptocurrencies) that meet specific customer needs
    at an affordable cost (EY [2017](#CR13)). The advantage can stem from using the
    digital currency as the transfer medium between two parties globally (i.e. as
    a universal means of exchange), which lowers transaction costs by preventing individuals
    from paying currency fees when they transfer money to different countries. Since
    they are universal currencies, cryptocurrencies eliminate the foreign exchange
    transaction fees that banks usually charge. Second, owing to the technology’s
    ability to establish a digital identity rapidly and cost-effectively, blockchain
    may enable banks to solve problems linked to KYC processes when trying to serve
    these potential customers, thus allowing the financial inclusion of previously
    underserved consumer segments.

    Schuetz和Venkatesh[2020](#CR40)）来触及无银行账户和少有银行账户的人群的需求。首先，银行可以通过允许他们创建满足特定客户需求且成本可承受的金融替代品（如加密货币）来触及这些个体（EY[2017](#CR13)）。这种优势可能源自将数字货币作为两方全球间的转移媒介（即作为通用交换手段），从而通过防止个人在向不同国家转账时支付货币费用来降低交易成本。由于它们是通用货币，加密货币消除了银行通常收取的外汇交易费用。其次，由于技术能够迅速、成本效益地建立数字身份，区块链可以让银行解决在试图为这些潜在客户提供服务时与KYC流程相关的问题，从而实现之前被忽视的消费者群体的金融包容性。

    existing banks and allow them to reach many new potential customers, thereby generating
    new revenue streams and improving their profitability. According to Accenture
    ([2015](#CR1)) estimates, by bringing today’s excluded individuals and businesses—particularly
    those in the larger and more affluent emerging market regions—into the formal
    banking sector banks could generate about $380 billion annually in new revenues.
    This view is also supported by recent research conducted by EY ([2017](#CR13)),
    which indicates that banks can drive inclusive growth, restore trust and boost
    profits by serving underbanked individuals and businesses in emerging markets.
    Specifically, EY ([2017](#CR13)) estimates that banks could generate incremental
    annual revenue of $200 billion by better serving financially excluded individuals
    and MSMEs in 60 emerging countries.

- en: This chapter shed light on blockchain’s potential implications for banks. It
    is important to differentiate between blockchain technology linked to cryptocurrencies
    (i.e. first-generation blockchain) and blockchain’s distributed ledger technology
    (i.e. second-generation blockchain). While blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies
    is perceived as a potential threat to banks because blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    represent a tool to disintermediate banks, blockchain’s distributed ledger technology
    (particularly private or permissioned blockchain) provides an opportunity since
    it may improve banking processes’ efficiency and the services that banks offer
    to their customers, with a positive impact on banks’ profitability. Lending, payment
    systems, trade finance and capital market are the main banking areas that could
    benefit from adopting blockchain technology. Moreover, blockchain may enable banks
    to create new product and services and to reach new customers from among the unbanked
    and underbanked populations, thus potentially generating major new revenue streams.
