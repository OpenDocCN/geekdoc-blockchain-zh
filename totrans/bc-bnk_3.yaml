    the financial sector that is capable of undermining traditional business models
    and the technologies currently in use in many financial service transactions.
    This chapter focuses on blockchain technology’s potential implications for the
    banking industry. Building on the results of a previous study that I conducted
    through qualitative-based interviews with three professional bankers from different
    European banks tackling the challenges of blockchain, this chapter discusses the
    potential advantages and risks that blockchain technology poses to banks and identifies
    the main banking areas that can be affected.

    and smart contracts—has attracted a great deal of attention and stimulated rich
    discussions among academics, practitioners and regulators around the world. It
    is now acknowledged as a disruptive force in the financial sector and can undermine
    the traditional business models and technologies that are currently employed in
    many key financial service transactions. As Philippon ([2016](#CR35), p. 2) notes,
    “such innovations can disrupt existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries,
    facilitate strategic disintermediation, revolutionize how existing firms create
    and deliver products and services, provide new gateways for entrepreneurship,
    democratize access to financial services, but also create significant privacy,
    regulatory and law enforcement challenges”.

    of higher-quality services. It may also allow the entry of new operators with

- en: With regard to blockchain’s potential implications for banks, it is worth noting
    that the first-generation blockchain (Blockchain 1.0.)—that is, blockchain used
    to support Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies)^([3](#Fn3))—was initially designed
    as a platform for disintermediation (Martino [2019](#CR28)). Its main purpose
    was to create an electronic payment system to allow the direct transfer of value
    between two parties without the need for a trusted third party (a central authority
    or an intermediary like a bank). Disintermediation means the blockchain linked
    to cryptocurrencies eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks because
    it enables individuals and organisations to transact and forge agreements directly
    with one another without risks. In this way, banks are no longer needed to verify
    the parties’ identities, establish trust or perform critical activities like the
    contracting, clearing, settling and record-keeping of tasks (McDonald et al. [2016](#CR27);
    Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR19); Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR21)).

- en: In theory, first-generation blockchain poses a threat to the banking industry
    since blockchain and Bitcoin (as well as other cryptocurrencies), taken together,
    are tools for disintermediating banks. According to McDonald et al. ([2016](#CR27)),
    blockchain can be considered a new institutional technology that might re-order
    the governance of the production of banking services since it enables bank transactions
    to move away from centralised hierarchical organisations towards a decentralised
    market.

    players (e.g. customers, banks, clearing systems, settlement systems and so on)
    working on a SWIFT network,^([4](#Fn4)) which banks use to transfer all types
    of financial information. To move money effectively, several centralised systems
    act as a “notary” of the transaction, making it a very long and complex process.
    Via blockchain, in conjunction with Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), this
    process can take place in a direct, secure and “final” way without the involvement
    of the players mentioned above. Specifically, owing to the key characteristics
    of the distributed ledger technology (see Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)),
    blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies makes it possible for two people who do
    not know each other to directly exchange digital assets in a secure and “final”
    way. This means that, at the end of the transaction, there is an effective ownership
    transfer (Martino [2019](#CR28)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the considerations above, first-generation blockchain can be considered
    a new player that competes with banks, since blockchain and cryptocurrencies facilitate
    new tools that can be deployed to manage the difficulties of transacting (MacDonald
    et al. [2016](#CR27); Lindman et al. [2017](#CR26); Frame et al. [2018](#CR15)),
    and they offer significant advantages over banks in several areas (e.g. payments)
    by allowing a fast, low-cost and secure way to transfer value. These advantages,
    as explained above, are associated with the elimination of intermediaries in transactions
    and the consequent banking fees. Furthermore, new blockchain-based start-ups (i.e.
    so-called fintech companies) may emerge and offer some banking services with lower
    fees, thus potentially causing banks to lose their market share (Philippon [2016](#CR35);
    Stulz [2019](#CR41)). For instance, many fintech start-ups are active today in
    segments of the value chain that are already managed by banks, such as business
    and consumer lending (PwC [2020](#CR37)). Such firms leverage blockchain technology
    to offer credits and funding to individuals and businesses with lower transaction
    costs; thus, they compete with traditional commercial banks. In this way, blockchain
    and cryptocurrencies may jeopardise one of the banking sector’s core business
    activities (i.e. lending), with the consequent erosion of bank revenue, thus undermining
    the banks’ profitability (Yeoh [2017](#CR44)). According to Gartner ([2018](#CR17)),
    one of the world’s leading research and advisory companies, 80% of heritage financial
    services firms will go out of business by 2030, become commoditised or exist only
    formally without competing effectively. The reason for this is that global digital
    platforms, fintech companies and other players will gain greater market share
    by using emerging technologies, such as blockchain, to change the industry’s economic
    and business models.

    In its annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released
    in February 2019, the Bank of America Corporation (BofA) listed cryptocurrencies
    among the risk factors that could have an impact on the bank’s competitiveness
    and reduce its revenues and profits. BofA reported that technological advances
    (such as cryptocurrencies) have enabled new players to offer products and services
    that had traditionally been banking products, as well as new innovative products,
    at a lower price, thereby increasing competition, which, in turn, may harm bank
    earnings through several channels. For instance, BofA points out that these new
    technologies create pressure on banks to lower the prices of—or the credit standards
    applied to—their products and services, require substantial expenditures to modify
    or adapt existing products and services in order to stay competitive and affect
    the willingness of customers to do business with banks. This can reduce banks’
    net interest margin and revenues from their fee-based products and services. This
    view is also supported by the large US bank JPMorgan Chase, which acknowledged
    in its annual 10-K filing that payment processing and other banking services could
    be significantly disrupted by new technologies like cryptocurrencies. It pointed
    out how these technologies require that banks make additional investments for
    them to remain competitive and can put pressure on the pricing of banks’ products
    and services or cause the bank to lose market share, particularly as far as traditional
    banking products like deposits and bank accounts are concerned. According to JPMorgan
    Chase, any such impact could reduce the bank’s revenues and profitability.

    to banks, since the application of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies is constrained
    by several limitations: there are numerous regulatory issues (linked to illicit
    activities like money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion), technical/scalability
    problems, business model challenges, government rules and others that currently
    limit the use of this kind of blockchain and mitigate the associated risks for
    banks (Martino [2019](#CR28)).'

- en: 'Regulation issues are among the most important problems limiting the application
    of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies at present since the banking sector is
    highly regulated, while blockchain and cryptocurrencies are, for the most part,
    not (yet). For instance, for issues related to terrorism and tax avoidance, among
    others, banks must track transactions step by step, which is not always feasible
    with first-generation blockchain, thus raising issues related to transaction traceability.
    As Houben and Snyers ([2018](#CR20)) argue, cryptocurrencies are thought to be
    very suitable for illicit activities given their anonymity, cross-border nature
    and quick transferability. The anonymity, in particular, which can vary from complete
    anonymity to pseudo-anonymity, prevents cryptocurrency transactions from being
    adequately monitored, thus allowing transactions to occur outside the regulatory
    perimeter and, consequently, enabling individuals to use cryptocurrencies for
    their unlawful actions. Therefore, regulators around the world are worried about
    criminals increasingly using cryptocurrencies to commit fraud and manipulation,
    tax evasion, hacking and money laundering or to fund terrorist activities, and
    they are trying to overcome such problems by regulating cryptocurrencies (see
    Chapter [5](490216_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml)). Another set of issues relates to privacy:
    in a simple transaction between two subjects, only the parties that participated
    in the operation (e.g. customers, banks, the central bank and the clearing system)
    have access to information about the transaction; by contrast, with public blockchain,
    everyone can access this information and see that one person has sent money to
    another. Also, as explained in Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml), the transparency
    inherent in public blockchain is such that anyone can retrieve the history of
    all transactions performed on a blockchain and rely on big data analytics to retrieve
    potentially sensitive information (De Filippi [2016](#CR10)). These regulatory
    problems currently limit the application of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies
    as a potential competitor to banks in areas like payment and lending. This, in
    turn, reduces the resulting risks to banks’ core business and profitability.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, other problems that limit the use of blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies
    and, consequently, reduce the potential risks for banks concern scalability and
    the high volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Regarding scalability
    problems, as explained in Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml), public blockchain
    on which cryptocurrencies operate can process only four to seven operations per
    second, while traditional systems today carry out even thousands of operations
    per second, thus making the latter more convenient than blockchain. The high volatility
    of cryptocurrencies generates problems relating to exchange rates with fiat currencies
    and the consequent foreign exchange risks.

    to cryptocurrencies as a competitor to banks in areas such as payment and lending,
    although it does represent a threat that will likely become more significant in
    the future, particularly if banks fail to fully exploit their potential and end
    up leaving room for new competitors.

    (first-generation blockchain) because of the lack of regulation and technical
    problems, they are embracing blockchain’s underlying distributed ledger technology,
    particularly private or permissioned blockchain,^([5](#Fn5)) thanks to the many
    benefits it may offer. As explained in the previous chapter, since a permissioned
    blockchain is a closed system between pre-defined organisations, it does not suffer
    from public blockchain’s regulatory issues (e.g. traceability and privacy issues).
    Also, it requires lower costs and computational power to work than public blockchains,
    thus mitigating scalability concerns.

    is distributed and shared only among those with permission and in an immutable
    way, guaranteeing cybersecurity), banks may obtain several advantages. Many scholars
    and financial players (Buitenhek [2016](#CR5); Guo and Liang [2016](#CR18); Peters
    and Panayi [2016](#CR34)) suggest that the distributed ledger technology of blockchain
    may solve most of the problems currently affecting traditional banking processes,
    such as efficiency bottlenecks, transaction lags, fraud and operational risks,
    by cutting costs, boosting process efficiency and increasing security. According
    to these studies, blockchain may be applied to change the ways financial services
    are offered and will improve traditional financial institutions’ competitive advantages
    by enabling smart contracts, maintaining immutable logs of transactions and facilitating
    the real-time execution of transactions (McKinsey & Company [2016](#CR29); KPMG
    [2017](#CR22)).

    their business model to provide their services, they may exploit its benefits
    to improve their efficiency in terms of reducing operational cost and time. Specifically,

    concern different banking processes and operations (Yermack [2019](#CR45)). According
    to a study by Santander InnoVentures (the Spanish bank’s fintech investment arm),
    in collaboration with Oliver Wyman and the Anthemis Group ([2015](#CR39)), it
    is possible to identify 20–25 usage cases where blockchain technology may be applied.
    The study also estimates that blockchain’s distributed ledger technology could
    cut banks’ infrastructure costs by up to between $15 billion and $20 billion a
    year by 2022\. These usage cases include several banking areas and operations
    such as international money transfers, trade finance, syndicated lending, securities
    trading and regulatory compliance. In line with these findings, a joint analysis
    by Accenture and McLagen ([2017](#CR3)) estimates that blockchain may reduce infrastructure
    costs for eight of the world’s 10 largest investment banks by an average of 30%,
    which means $8 billion to $12 billion in annual cost savings for those banks,
    including: a 70% reduction in central financial reporting; a 30% to 50% reduction

    efficiency are clearing and settlement systems, which currently require a complex
    process with many players, myriad messages and manual reconciliations and are,
    therefore, characterised by long times (Buithenek [2016](#CR5); Fanning and Centers
    [2016](#CR14); Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR34)). Blockchain technology may provide
    a better clearing and settlement system by allowing banks to clear and settle
    directly and securely, thereby reducing operational costs and timing for activities
    like corporate lending and capital markets. According to an Accenture Consulting
    ([2017](#CR3)) study, large investment banks could save $10 billion by using blockchain
    technology to improve the efficiency of clearing and settlement, which are currently
    managed via a host of messages and manual reconciliations.

- en: Thus, activities such as securities transactions, where post-trade clearing
    and settlement is slow and expensive and involves many parties, may benefit from
    the adoption of blockchain (Yermack [2019](#CR45)), which can securely and transparently
    move securities in seconds or minutes, with automatic clearing and settlement
    (Buithenek [2016](#CR5)). As a consequence, this would lead to reduced costs and
    lower counterparty risk associated with clearing and settlement (McKinsey & Company
    [2016](#CR29)). Several transactions have demonstrated the blockchain’s impact
    on capital markets. For instance, in April 2019, Société Générale SFH, a subsidiary
    of Société Générale Group, issued €100 million in covered bonds as a security
    token directly registered on the Ethereum blockchain, exploring a more efficient
    process for bond issuances by reducing costs and the number of intermediaries
    involved. Subsequently, in September 2019, Banco Santander issued the first end-to-end
    blockchain bond (worth $20 million) using the public Ethereum blockchain, which
    allowed the bank to tokenise the bond securely (i.e. digitally represent traditional
    assets on the blockchain) and register it in a permissioned manner on the blockchain.
    The automation of the entire process enabled the bank to reduce the number of
    intermediaries required in the process, making the transaction faster, simpler
    and more efficient.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another activity in this area covers syndicated loans, which take on average
    around 20 days for a transaction to be settled by the banks due to the quantity
    of information exchanged, lengthy reviews and the paper forms of communication
    between parties (Fanning and Centers [2016](#CR14)). Blockchain may reduce the
    time and costs for the transaction by automating the entire process and making
    it more transparent. First, when a party enters contract information into the
    blockchain, information is made available in real time to all other parties, thus
    removing the need for paper communications and multiple contract reviews. Also,
    smart contracts can be used to digitise the syndicated loan to reconcile trades
    against credit agreements, automatically debit interest payments from the borrower’s
    account and adjust loan liability within the blockchain. As Rutenberg and Wenner
    ([2017](#CR38)) suggest, by using smart contacts, it is possible to manage the
    entire process—from entering into the loan contract and collecting interest payments
    to calling a default and even seizing collateral—without any human involvement.
    This can reduce the need for manual reconciliations and processing, which can
    result in time and cost savings. For instance, in 2018, Spain’s BBVA and two partner
    banks (MUFG of Japan and BNP Paribas of France) completed the first syndicated
    loan (to the tune of €150 million) on blockchain with the Red Eléctrica corporation,
    thus providing a working example of how such transactions can be simplified and
    accelerated by using blockchain technology. The whole negotiation process was
    done over a private blockchain network, which significantly expedited the process
    while ensuring full documentation tracking and negotiation transparency.

    Financial institutions are required to make credit assessments and perform payments—often

    digitalise and authenticate records (e.g. via smart contracts) and allowing the
    parties involved in an operation to access the same information, it is possible
    to reduce time, cost and operational risk (Buithenek [2016](#CR5); Guo and Liang
    [2016](#CR18)). This means that blockchain may enable participants from different
    sectors (e.g. banking and freight shipping) to directly interact and share information
    in a more easily verifiable and decentralised manner to increase the speed of
    transactions and reduce the need for paper reconciliation (FSB [2019](#CR16)).
    For instance, in May 2018, HSBC and ING Bank completed the world’s first commercially
    viable trade finance transaction for the international food and agriculture conglomerate
    Cargill by using blockchain (specifically, R3’s scalable Corda blockchain platform).
    HSBC issued a letter of credit to ING for the firm Cargill and executed the transaction
    in a record time of 24 hours instead of the standard period of 5–10 days by removing
    the need for paper reconciliation, since all parties were linked on the platform

    Currently, value transfer is expensive and slow, particularly in cross-border
    payments, because of a series of complicated processes (e.g. manual reconciliation)
    and the need for intermediary clearing firms. A single payment transaction often
    involves a significant number of parties and is typically carried out through
    decentralised and complex correspondent banking networks that face challenges
    relating to cost and customer due diligence, as well as inefficiencies from operations
    across different currencies, message formats, time zones and laws (FSB [2019](#CR16)).
    For example, sending $100 from a country in Europe to a country in Africa can
    cost around $10 extra and require several (on average, five) days for processing.

    reduce transaction inefficiency by automating reconciliation, reducing operational
    costs or increasing the availability of “know-your-customer” (KYC) data. Specifically,
    by applying blockchain technology to payments, transactions can be executed directly
    between banks without any third party, thus simplifying the process and offering
    many advantages to banks, such as lower transaction and operational costs, as
    well as increased processing speed (Buithenek [2016](#CR5); Fanning and Centers
    [2016](#CR14); Guo and Liang [2016](#CR18)). According to estimates by Deloitte
    ([2016](#CR11)), business-to-business and person-to-person payments across borders
    with blockchain may result in a 40–80% reduction in transaction costs and take
    an average of four to six seconds to finalise, instead of the standard transfer
    process of two to three days. In April 2018, Banco Santander launched the first
    blockchain-based international money transfer service, which makes it possible
    for customers to complete international transfers on the same day or by the next
    day. It also shows the exact amount that customers will receive in the destination

    is a time-consuming task for the financial institutions and regulators who have
    to process such vast amounts of information. Blockchain could significantly reduce
    the costs associated with such operations. It may simplify all administrative
    work involved in the compliance process since with blockchain a transaction is
    automatic, and then it automatically feeds the compliance database. For instance,
    Buithenek ([2016](#CR5)) suggests that blockchain, by enabling smart contracts,
    could make it possible to enforce compliance upfront instead of verifying it after
    a transaction, thereby dramatically reducing the time and effort that financial
    institutions spend on regulatory reporting and improving the quality, accuracy
    and speed of the entire process. As a result, it will also reduce the costs involved.
    This means that compliance can work in real time concerning the payment process
    (and, in general, any banking activity), improve the speed of processes and reduce
    the related costs. Furthermore, blockchain may be used to keep track of the steps
    that regulations require: immutably recording transactions on the distributed
    ledger, which renders information decentralised and accessible, provides a comprehensive,
    secure and irreversible financial audit trail for regulators to verify compliance,
    thus eliminating the need for regulators to collect, store, reconcile and aggregate
    information. By allowing regulators and central banks to independently extract
    information on transactions, banks may avoid all the administrative work, which

    and Ross [2017](#CR31)). Such processes in many financial institutions are inefficient
    and characterised by long times, the duplication of effort and a potential for
    error, which are costly and could also harm customers’ experience (Capgemini [2019](#CR6)).
    A global survey by Thomson Reuters ([2016](#CR42)) reports that the costs and
    complexity of KYC are rising, and financial institutions are spending between
    $60 million and $500 million per year to keep up with KYC and customer due diligence
    regulations.

    make it more secure and efficient. Through its cryptographic protection, which
    helps to keep information secure, and its ability to share a constantly updated
    record with many parties, blockchain may ensure consistent and reliable customer
    information. This means that once customers carry out the full KYC process with
    one bank, information resulting from the KYC process may be shared with other
    banks, which will eliminate redundant work and reduce the number of steps in current
    KYC practices. Fundamentally, blockchain may enable the creation of a chronological,
    decentralised and shared data depository in which banks that need to conduct KYC
    practices for a customer can directly verify the result of the process that has
    already been conducted for this customer, thereby avoiding duplicate KYC tasks
    and achieving cost and time savings. This may lead to an increase in efficiency
    in the broad sense, both as lower costs and time to do KYC processes and because
    the customer has the immediate benefit of opening an account, unlike other current
    systems. Indeed, from a customer standpoint, blockchain can reduce on-boarding
    wait times and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same information to
    their financial services providers (KPMG [2018](#CR23)).

    of banks’ potential profitability. If banks can incorporate this technology into
    their business models and boost their efficiency in terms of cost reductions,
    they may reduce the commissions they charge their customers and have a better
    margin, since the decrease in the commissions may be balanced by the decrease
    in costs. Thus, blockchain can be instrumental in improving the quality of the
    services offered to clients, which will provide an important competitive edge.
    Nonetheless, it is worth noting that, to date, there has not been any evidence
    of blockchain technology usage leading to efficiency improvements (i.e. cost reductions).
    It will take two to three years before blockchain proves that it works effectively
    and can generate advantages for banks (Martino [2019](#CR28)).

    all the benefits mentioned above. For instance, regarding the benefits identified
    in compliance processes (the KYC process and regulatory reporting), there are
    regulatory issues (e.g. relating to privacy and security, like the General Data
    Protection Regulation or GDPR^([6](#Fn6))) that may constrain the use of blockchain
    technology in these banking processes. In KYC processes, for example, privacy
    issues must be addressed before adopting blockchain, since customers must first
    authorise the sharing of their data between banks. Thus, it is necessary to address
    these issues before adopting blockchain in these areas. Moreover, there is the
    problem of the progressive adoption of blockchain and the resulting standardisation
    to allow for interoperability, that is, the ability to share information without
    restrictions across different blockchain networks (Casey et al. [2018](#CR8)).
    Specifically, different blockchain systems will need to be interoperable with
    other ledgers and integrated with existing systems if they are to be introduced
    at scale into the financial system. As research by Moody’s ([2019](#CR30)) suggests,
    standardisation is vital to improving interoperability between blockchains, applications
    built on the same blockchain, and between blockchains and legacy IT systems, thereby
    facilitating the establishment of blockchain-based ecosystems. This means that
    the involvement of the entire banking system is essential: it becomes profitable
    to use blockchain only if all banks adopt the same methodology to transmit information.
    Then, it is necessary to have collaboration across industries (i.e. other financial
    institutions, such as insurance or non-financial companies) and along the value
    chain to enable the broad adoption of blockchain and harness its benefits.'

    of blockchain for banks is access to lots of information. Having recorded on the
    distributed ledger a full and transparent history that any client banks have on
    board, blockchain may provide a way for banks to gain swift and secure access
    to updated customer data, resulting in greater operational efficiency and a reduction
    in the time and cost needed to gather and process data.

    a competitive advantage (Prescott [2016](#CR36)). Since information on customer
    payments and credit profiles represents a source of knowledge about customers
    for banks, banks may utilise this information as a key resource to generate new
    products and services in order to better address customer needs (Martino [2019](#CR28)).
    Nevertheless, the key advantage for banks is the ability to access numerous and
    diversified kinds of information—relating not only to the bank (e.g. information
    on customers) but also to other organisations such as ships, ports and so on and
    their resulting exploitation—to create new products and services that do not exist
    yet. The availability of a series of distributed information derived from a variety
    of sources gives banks a better and more complete understanding of their customers’
    behaviours, needs and preferences (Prescott [2016](#CR36)), which enables banks
    to create and offer products and services tailored to these customers’ individual
    needs.

    institution (Demirguc-Kunt et al. [2018](#CR12)). They constitute what has been
    called the unbanked population, while many other individuals have limited access
    to traditional financial services and are known as the underbanked population.^([7](#Fn7))
    Together, these groups account for some 2 billion financially excluded individuals
    worldwide.^([8](#Fn8)) Moreover, over half the micro, small and mid-sized enterprises
    (MSMEs) in emerging markets, equalling more than 200 million businesses, currently
    do not have access to banking services (EY [2017](#CR13)).

- en: These individuals face difficulties accessing banking services for several reasons.
    First, banks have difficulties reaching these individuals because of their poor
    credit histories and the lack of appropriate identification needed to open a bank
    account, for example, which makes it hard to implement KYC practices and other
    eligibility and due diligence requirements to formally open an account. Additional
    problems relate to the affordability of financial products and services, deficient
    payment and credit infrastructures, the limited geographical access to financial
    institutions and so on (Natarajan et al. [2017](#CR32); Lichtfous et al. [2018](#CR25)).

    making the costs and profits in serving this segment more attractive (Ouma et
    al. [2017](#CR33); EY [2017](#CR13)). This part of the world population may represent
    a key opportunity for banks since blockchain technology could allow them to access
    banking services much more easily.

    by addressing their needs and solving most of the abovementioned challenges (Natarajan
    et al. [2017](#CR32); Lichtfous et al. [2018](#CR25); Schuetz and Venkatesh [2020](#CR40)).
    First, banks can reach these individuals by allowing them to create their own
    financial alternatives (e.g. cryptocurrencies) that meet specific customer needs
    at an affordable cost (EY [2017](#CR13)). The advantage can stem from using the
    digital currency as the transfer medium between two parties globally (i.e. as
    a universal means of exchange), which lowers transaction costs by preventing individuals
    from paying currency fees when they transfer money to different countries. Since
    they are universal currencies, cryptocurrencies eliminate the foreign exchange
    transaction fees that banks usually charge. Second, owing to the technology’s
    ability to establish a digital identity rapidly and cost-effectively, blockchain
    may enable banks to solve problems linked to KYC processes when trying to serve
    these potential customers, thus allowing the financial inclusion of previously
    underserved consumer segments.

    existing banks and allow them to reach many new potential customers, thereby generating
    new revenue streams and improving their profitability. According to Accenture
    ([2015](#CR1)) estimates, by bringing today’s excluded individuals and businesses—particularly
    those in the larger and more affluent emerging market regions—into the formal
    banking sector banks could generate about $380 billion annually in new revenues.
    This view is also supported by recent research conducted by EY ([2017](#CR13)),
    which indicates that banks can drive inclusive growth, restore trust and boost
    profits by serving underbanked individuals and businesses in emerging markets.
    Specifically, EY ([2017](#CR13)) estimates that banks could generate incremental
    annual revenue of $200 billion by better serving financially excluded individuals
    and MSMEs in 60 emerging countries.

- en: This chapter shed light on blockchain’s potential implications for banks. It
    is important to differentiate between blockchain technology linked to cryptocurrencies
    (i.e. first-generation blockchain) and blockchain’s distributed ledger technology
    (i.e. second-generation blockchain). While blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies
    is perceived as a potential threat to banks because blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    represent a tool to disintermediate banks, blockchain’s distributed ledger technology
    (particularly private or permissioned blockchain) provides an opportunity since
    it may improve banking processes’ efficiency and the services that banks offer
    to their customers, with a positive impact on banks’ profitability. Lending, payment
    systems, trade finance and capital market are the main banking areas that could
    benefit from adopting blockchain technology. Moreover, blockchain may enable banks
    to create new product and services and to reach new customers from among the unbanked
    and underbanked populations, thus potentially generating major new revenue streams.

    is hampered by several regulatory and technical issues that currently reduce the

    distributed ledger technology by incorporating the technology into their business
    models.
