    almost from its beginning, directing its expansion from its redoubt in The Dalles
    to the ends of the earth. Early in 2017, he reported on his feats to the annual
    Optical Fiber Conference, which gathers the world’s leading optical engineers
    and scientists to contemplate the unbounded demands for modulated light and the
    exquisitely crafted machines needed to transmit, amplify, add, drop, shape, shuffle,
    switch, and carry it.[¹](notes.html#ch18note-1)

    a distance the length of Long Island, combine thousands of threads in each cable
    and scores of data-bearing wavelengths in each thread, and are made of glass so
    pure that you could see through a pane of it forty miles thick. What Hölzle calls
    “low-power, high-density coherent optics” is one of the heroic feats of engineering
    in the Information Age, and it allowed him to increase the bandwidth across his
    data centers fifty-fold in six years. His forty-two-kilohertz global information
    finder-fetcher, completing forty-two thousand searches per second, each one entailing
    hundreds or thousands of computing steps, is a historic technological achievement.

    a 12,899-kilometer line running from California to Hong Kong, will carry data
    at a rate of 144 terabits a second. Such speeds have pushed bandwidth up twenty-nine-fold
    since 2010, when Google’s Unity cable between the West Coast and Japan began service.
    In 2018, Google was planning an even more capacious cable all the way from New
    York to Japan.

    audience, Hölzle might have offered a message of thanks and celebration. But he
    had come to Los Angeles not so much to celebrate as to complain. His entire endeavor,
    he declared, was “approaching a wall.”[²](notes.html#ch18note-2) These relentless
    bandwidth gains, up sixtyfold in seven years, were both inadequate and too costly.
    Facing the disaggregation of memory, storage, and computation across the planet
    (“Schmidt’s Law,” which I described in chapter 2) and the explosion of demand
    for Google’s services, he needed almost immediate tenfold step-function improvements
    in bandwidth and connectivity.

    seas and continents were one thing. But input-output—catching the light-speed
    rush of photons from hundreds of different messages on each ten-micron core of
    each bundled thread and channeling them to the right addresses—was all too difficult
    and costly. Hölzle wanted cloud 3.0\. He wanted pluggable fiber optics modules
    made in volume on automated equipment at one-tenth the cost. He wanted fiber optics
    to improve far faster than microchip gear under Moore’s Law, and he wanted the
    price to drop even faster still. He wanted the moon, fast and cheap.

    industry, Hölzle’s complaint was an early sign of the death of a paradigm. Paradigms
    die when they no longer fit the conditions of the real world. Propelled beyond
    the bounds of economic and technological reality by the nearly infinite demand
    for free goods, Hölzle and the rest of the Google team have no idea of the real
    demand for their products. Demand is registered by price signals, and none are
    transmitted. Google was confounded by its commitment to free and its idea of a
    zero-marginal-cost economy.

    marginal costs—Hölzle’s “wall”—in the face of surging demand for Google’s cornucopia
    of valuable products at no cost. Think of a billion addicted teenagers around
    the world turning to “free apps” on their open-source Android phones an average
    of eighty times a day.[³](notes.html#ch18note-3)

    consumption is the scarcity of time. Beyond the scores of hours a week for its
