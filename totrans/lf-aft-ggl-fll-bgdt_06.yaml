    Columbia River Gorge to the quaint Oregon town of The Dalles (rhymes with “pals”),
    seems like a journey into an alluring American past. Through a filigree of Douglas
    firs you glimpse ancient basalt bluffs riven by glittering waterfalls. Signs direct
    you to museums of native Americana, full of feathery and leathery tribal relics.

    nearby rapids on the Columbia River—back when the local industry involved transporting
    beaver pelts by canoe. Now the beavers are left alone, and the aluminum plants
    are mostly abandoned, but The Dalles is booming. Here beside the river, six miles
    west of the dam, Google bought thirty acres in 2005 for the company’s first owned-and-operated

    to two billion (out of some $29 billion invested in its global plant). With its

    is a fiber-optic artery built in 2001 to handle 640 gigabits per second (billions
