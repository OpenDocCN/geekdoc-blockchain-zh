    but also because I believe in the collaboration of two different technologies
    to enrich the real-world problem. This book combines two interesting topics, i.e.,
    probabilistic data structure and blockchain technology. When I first heard about
    the concept of this book, I was pleased as this book is coming up with a new concept.
    Reading this book readers will find develop a reason on usage of probabilistic
    data structures for blockchain technology that too in easy and most understandable
    language. To make the concepts more clear, examples have been taken by the authors.
    Moreover, for preparing questions and classroom activities, each chapter contains
    a set of MCQ's and some questions. Even if you don't have any good computer science
    experience, this book explains concepts from basics.

- en: The blockchain technology is growing rapidly. The biggest challenge that blockchain
    technology faces is the storage issue. Some believe blockchain technology is not
    getting much popularity because of data deduplication which leads to high space
    requirements and query processing on blockchain data takes a lot of time. I believe
    this book is one of the best investments to answer those minds. This book aims
    to discuss techniques to analyze big data on blockchain databases with less storage
    and minimized time complexity making use of probabilistic data structures. Probabilistic
    data structure eases query execution keeping a huge amount of data in mind. Also,
    the practical execution of probabilistic data structure and blockchain is shown
    using Python language. This book is introduced for technology practitioners, software
    developers, researchers, professional developers, students, teachers, and decision-makers.
