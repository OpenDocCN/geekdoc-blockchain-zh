- en: 'The chapter describes conceptually how a blockchain (BC), through smart contracts
    (SC) and tokenisation, can act as a stigmergic information layer for the creation
    of collective digital factories in construction. The chapter focuses on the orchestration
    of a series of design agents and tools in the design of buildings; however, the
    presented framework can be extended to the whole lifecycle of the AEC industry.
    Furthermore, a cryptoeconomics-like strategy for the AEC industry is explored,
    based on smart contracts, having the potential to operationalise the stigmergic
    coordination via token incentive mechanisms. We expect that stigmergic coordination
    through cryptoeconomic incentives on the blockchain is a better fit for the fragmented
    nature of the construction industry, compared to current modes of organisation;
    consequently, the scope for presenting this strategy is threefold: the incentives
    mechanism can lead to an increase in productivity, a reduction in both whole-lifecycle
    carbon and waste, and a decentralised governance through smart contracts. While
    blockchain and decentralised ledger technologies have proven to have the potential
    to be embedded deeply as an information governance layer in many industries, the
    scope within the paper is limited to the digital aspects of the AEC industry,
    forming what we call “collective digital factories”. An engagement strategy of
    the manufacturing sector of the AEC industry is presented with arising open questions
    discussed at the end.'

- en: Value in Architectural design is a controversial subject, as it normally is
    related to the cost of a building rather than the value of the act of design.
    Academic and professional sources that reference value in architectural design
    tend to come from allied disciplines in evaluating costs of design, for example,
    quantity surveying [RICS source] or specifiers [[7](#CR7), [15](#CR15)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Value is also ascribed to the level of control an individual or group has over
    the design of a building [[15](#CR15)], where a sense of ownership for the design
    will develop in the designer, by having a high degree of autonomy and control
    in making decisions. Architectural design, however, is not a solitary act. It
    involves a variety of stakeholders, and in most cases encompasses groups of architectural
    designers working together to achieve a common goal. Design Value is the value
    attached to the design specification in relation to cost. In that sense, value
    management or value engineering exercises are driven towards cost reduction against
    a requirement specification for the client. As such, architects have surrogated
    value and the discussion around value to other professions, whether these are
    specifiers or quantity surveyors or construction managers, that value and cost
    estimate the physical object of the building. In a similar manner, the Target
    Value Design process structures design processes that work towards the budget
    the client has available, instead of designing, then evaluating the design, and
    then optimising the existing design to fit the available budget. Target Value
    Design “relies on clusters of collaboration organised by systems (e.g. envelopes,
    structures, mechanical)” [[38](#CR38)]. Tillman et al. [[40](#CR40)] have found
    that costs in TVD appearing in three categories, (a) product design (b) process
    design, and (c) service design. Product design affects the design and costs associated
    with the building itself, process design impacts the costs of the building production
    system, and service design affects the service and maintenance of the building.
    Design activity however is when the true value gets created [[3](#CR3)] as the
    designer brings the process of physical resources together in a coordinated manner.
    These value judgements by the designer are executed according to Broadbent, via
    the comparison and relative performance of parameters and conflicting factors
    that are inherent into the design process. In a sense, value in the design arises
    from the act of prioritising one parameter over another.

    have a deep impact on the value chain of the AEC industry, and due to the low
    productivity of the construction industry globally [[32](#CR32)] they are subject
    to disruption by new organisational structures and models. The shifts taking place
    though in sustainability requirements, costs, skills scarcity [[18](#CR18)], materials
    and industrial approaches [[41](#CR41)], digitisation [[11](#CR11)] and the emergence
    of a new class of industrial competitors in the face of digital companies entering
    the construction industry, are set to transform the production of the value chain.
    Some of the future trends predicted by the McKinsey report “the new normal” in
    construction include Value-Chain Control and integration with industrial-grade
    supply chains, consolidation, and sustainability. Within the emergence of industrial-grade
    supply chains, the importance lies within modularisation and off-site production,
    and the shift of the construction supply chain towards a product and assembly-based
    approach. This industrial shift, coupled with digitisation of products and services,
    leads to various strategies where companies attempt to integrate design with the
    value chain [[30](#CR30)] by harnessing the collaborative power of Building Information
    Modelling, shifting crucial decision-making early in the design and construction
    process rather than have construction and design run in parallel modes. The employment
    of BIM, and the incorporation of scheduling and cost as additional information
    layers, along with automated parametric design and the use of blockchain technologies
    have the potential to radically transform construction.

    “Built environment is responsible for significant use of energy (62%) and is a
    major source of greenhouse emissions (55%) [[2](#CR2)] Embodied carbon and carbon
    from operational use are the dominant factors in the environmental impact of a
    built asset, with the construction phase surprisingly contributing only 2%. Embodied
    carbon and operational carbon are interrelated: decreasing one, increases the
    other. Significant gains in both are possible with optimised architectural designs.
    In parallel, carbon efficiencies are interconnected with supply chain structure,
    which in turn is integral to the social and economic aspects of the Architecture-Engineering-Construction
    (AEC) industry, making the carbon impact of the built environment a difficult
    problem to solve. As such an interdisciplinary collaboration framework that allows
    AEC stakeholders to create improved carbon mitigation and adaptation strategies
    is needed [[35](#CR35)]. Such a collaboration framework may be thought to exist

    faced by the industry via integration of carbon accounting with Building Information
    Modelling. Within this integration, it becomes apparent that certain BIM tools
    (aggregate the lifecycle assessment information for many off the building components
    in their database and as such the designer/researcher needs to disaggregate the
    data from the components. This leads to a need for a better, more accurate and
    well accounted process for accounting for embodied carbon in the design process.
    Certain practices in the UK for an example, also believe in the same processes
    resulting in the creation of dedicated embodied carbon accounting plugins [[37](#CR37)].
    Fenner et al. [[20](#CR20)] take a holistic look at the Lifecycle assessment of
    the buildings and focus on which parts of the lifecycle should most mitigate actions.
    They find great discrepancies in the measurement of carbon emissions amongst the
    literature. The result is that the construction part of an asset does not account
    for much in the Lifecycle Carbon Assessment process, however the production phase
    of the asset and the operational phase account for the majority of emissions.
    The paper also calls for the creation of a benchmark system that can be used to
    compare carbon intensities among buildings and help inform policy and design.
    Within this policy envelope, Evans et al. [[16](#CR16)] call for the forging of
    an environmental governance, where the management of carbon emissions is transformed
    into an issue of carbon governance, executed in parallel with a transition to
    a low carbon economy. They identify then three types of experimental governance:
    policy, technology, and urban laboratories. The latter is a type of experimental
    governance project, a policy envelope where decarbonisation is married with economic
    development. These projects are normally run with a heavy research university
    involvement and develop an integration with their urban context to avoid a kind
    of “island” effect in their relationship with the city. Within the example they
    provide in the Manchester’s Oxford corridor, they mention that the pooling of
    resources of a range of stakeholders, can result in reducing ecological impact
    and increasing economic growth, if the stakeholders orchestrate the resource utilisation
    in a coordinated manner. Within the Oxford Road experiment, they describe the
    use of embedded IoT sensors to examine and test not only the carbon performance
    but also the ecological performance of various materials in an urban setting.
    They use then the data to inform policy of where to plant trees, resulting in
    an ever-optimised recursive cycle, as the planting of trees will in turn inform
    the data in the future. We can reflect though that the governance of this type
    of projects focuses on quantitative measurements in a wider technocratisation
    of decision-making approaches, which are not always easy for the public, non-expert
    stakeholders to participate in [[16](#CR16)].'

    extends beyond simple technical decisions in the design and construction of the
    building but extend to the supply chain and its integration with the design process.
    Subsequently, policy, governance and technical decisions need to be orchestrated
    in a socio-technical framework that is both informed by data also in such a manner
    where data and evidence from it are applied in a recursive manner of continuous
    improvement, both in the same project but also globally from project to project.
    The challenge thus is to conceive and maintain methods of project governance that
    optimise and reduce carbon, with the most important areas of focus being embodied
    and operational, but also do it via collective governance.

    to provide spontaneous ordering. Delving within the mechanisms that structure
    stigmergy, Heylghten discusses stigmergy as a state machine with production rules,
    where the rules affect and change the state, and the state provides feedback and
    direction on where the rules need to be applied within a body of “work”. Forming
    this parallel, Heylighten frames condition as the antecedent of the state and
    action as the consequence of the state, where the condition is the current state
    of the world, and action changes that state to form a new condition (Fig. [1](#Fig1)).![](../images/504856_1_En_11_Chapter/504856_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.png)

    of the agent as a decision-maker, instead, stigmergy is defined with ignorance
    on the agent level, with agent-less process, for example, physical events or processes.
    This in effect makes stigmergy as a concept compatible with the notion of creating
    collaborative work using the blockchain, as within the blockchain automation actions
    change the current state to a new one. Agents do participate in the system, but
    only when defined as external to the blockchain actor. Additionally, the medium
    of stigmergy, for example, lumps of muds for termites, is forming the state itself,
    and undergoes changes through actions, whose states are sensed as conditions for
    other subsequent actions. Hence the medium, in our case the blockchain, carries
    the communication between subsequent actions, and coordinates indirectly the agents
    that act stigmergically. Constructed within the medium, the overall goal of the
    system is encoded. To provide an example, Heylighten describes the problems of
    coordination in construction, that arise from planning and from its contingencies
    and structural interconnectedness and points to well-established issues of coordination
    in construction. With this description, a proposal is made for a website where
    all construction actions and states are recorded by construction workers so that
    everyone has the most up-to-date, current state of affairs in their hands, a description
    that sounds accurately like a decentralised ledger that records all action.

- en: Stigmergic coordination in construction is also analysed by Christensen [[6](#CR6)],
    in an effort to provide a self-organised, emerging framework for collaboration
    in construction. Initially, Christensen compares and contrasts Stigmergy with
    other coordination and collaboration concepts. Specifically, stigmergy is compared
    to articulation, awareness, feedthrough. With all three concepts, stigmergy is
    unique in the sense that it differs from having to develop the work and an articulation
    about the work (articulation) nor is it needed to develop awareness for certain
    activities for certain workers (awareness) as stigmergic means already plays that
    role globally for the system of work, while also it differs from a conduit metaphor,
    where workers communicate through the feeding information through artefacts, as
    actors engaged in Stigmergy have a different basis for their actions than telementation.
    Still construction workers pay heed to the material evidence of work previously
    executed, while performing their own tasks, a very strong indication that construction
    activities are stigmergic. This incorporates the idea that workers coordinating
    through the material field of work are mindful of the material work that needs
    to be developed by others in the future, rather than just paying heed to work
    accomplished in the past.

    material artefact of the blockchain is integrated with the digital tools the architects

    and the need to motivate or incentivise coordination. Notably he writes this in
    2009, just before the first blockchain appears. Within decentralised planning,
    he notes that without a system-wide optimum, the profits are generated mainly
    for the large players within the system, and to counter that argues for optimal
    coordination. This then introduces the understanding of a coordination system:

    of the system.” Within decentralised planning as such Albrecht identifies information
    asymmetry as one of the main reasons why decentralised planning might fail: i.e.
    not all participants have the best information possible. The alternative, of sharing
    private data with everybody, is identified as problematic, as it might lead to
    the loss of a competitive advantage. As such the mathematical models developed
    up until then discuss only the planning that one participant in the supply chain
    will execute not the decentralised planning as a whole supply chain, coordinating
    every aspect of supply. Albrecht provides examples of early or late decentralised
    supply chains that result in suboptimal execution, even if all parties agree to
    upstream planning, i.e. planning with the needs of the buyer in mind, and proposes
    “collaborative” planning as the solution to the sub-optimisation of supply chains.'

    operations. Waste, is also part of the equation here, as the architectural design
    can via elegantly constructed geometry, supply chain choices and strategic choices
    of methods of construction embedded within design, directly increase and decrease
    waste. Productivity in the AEC sector, more so in construction, also firstly is
    affected by design choices and the complexity with which one develops a design.

    design choices and as such forms part of the goal and part of the incentives’
    scheme. Beyond the design phase the operational framework we present forms a smaller
    part of a larger ecosystem which is designed to incentivise the same behaviour
    in all other phases of a project (construction and assembly, operations and then
    decommissioning). The mechanism that we propose for design works best then as
    part of a larger cryptoeconomic shift in the manner in which AEC projects are

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Topologic is a software system that supports the creation of succinct spatial
    models that encode new layers of information and enable deeper analysis. Topologic
    uses boundary representation (brep) as the basis of its models. Objects in Topologic
    are represented by one or more Vertices, Edges, Wires, Faces, Shells, Cells, CellComplexes,
    and Clusters. A Vertex represents a location in space stored as three coordinates
    (*X*, *Y*, *Z*). An Edge is a line in space represented by its start Vertex and
    end Vertex. A Wire is represented by a set of connected Edges in any configuration.
    Edges in a Wire must connect through shared Vertices. A Face is a surface that
    is represented by one external boundary (a closed Wire) and a set of internal
    boundaries (a set of closed Wires) that represent holes in the Face. A Shell is
    represented by a set of connected Faces in any configuration. Faces in a Shell
    must connect through shared Edges. A Cell is a volume of space that is represented
    by an external boundary (a closed Shell) and a set of internal boundaries (a set
    of closed Shells) that represent voids in the Cell. A CellComplex is represented
    by a set of connected Cells in any configuration. The Cells in a CellComplex must
    connect through shared Faces. Lastly, a Cluster is represented as an ad-hoc group
    of objects in any configuration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The aforementioned objects are hierarchically connected which allows the user
    to deconstruct any object into its constituent sub-topologies. For example, a
    CellComplex can be decomposed into its constituent Cells which in turn can be
    decomposed into Faces, Edges, and Vertices. This hierarchical connection is bi-directional
    which means that lower-dimensional entities can be queried for the higher dimensional
    parents of which they are a member. It is important to note that objects in Topologic
    are spatially resolved which means that overlapping entities do not exist. For
    example, if we ask a Cube (Cell) for its number of Faces, Edges, and Vertices,
    the answer will be six (6), twelve (12), and eight (8), respectively. There is
    no need in Topologic to check for overlapping entities and to remove redundant
    shapes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to bi-directional hierarchical connectivity, Topologic supports
    bi-directional lateral connectivity. This means that you can query a Topologic
    entity for any of its adjacent entities. For example, you can ask a Cell in a
    CellComplex for its adjacent Cells (neighbours) that share a Face with it. You
    can also ask two entities to return any shared entities between them (e.g. ask
    two Cells in a CellComplex to return the face that they share).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More formally, one can implement the above as a topological graph made of vertices
    and edges where a vertex (*V*) represents any entity in a Topologic model, and
    an edge (*E*). In fact, Topologic implements a Graph class that can convert any
    Topologic model into a graph. This allows the user to apply graph theory to analyse
    the model including computing the shortest distance between elements and measuring
    the centrality of vertices in a graph among others.

- en: 'Topologic also allows the user to store ad hoc entities within other entities
    in the model using a Content/Context mechanism. This type of relationship is many-to-many
    in that an object can exist as the content within more than one entity and thus
    it can exist in more than one Context. For example, a window entity can be stored
    in the contents of the wall to which it belongs, but also in the contents of the
    room to which it also belongs. In this case, one can say that the window exists
    in the two contexts: The context of the wall, and the context of the room.'

- en: Beyond geometry and topology, Topologic supports the encoding of semantic information
    through the creation of dictionaries. A dictionary stores an ad hoc set of keys
    and values. Dictionaries can be associated with an entity as well as with its
    sub-topologies. For example, a Cell can have a dictionary describing its attributes.
    In addition, the Cell’s Faces can each have their own dictionaries, their Edges,
    and Vertices can also each have their own dictionaries. This allows for granular
    and hierarchical encoding of information in a Topologic model. Dictionaries can
    affect and be affected by geometric Boolean operations. New entities that emerge
    for such operations can inherit and merge the dictionaries of their parents. For
    example, if a Cell named “*A*” is merged with another Cell named “*B*” the resulting
    intersection will automatically inherit and merge the dictionaries of the parent
    cells resulting in its name being listed as (*A*, *B*). Lastly, values in dictionaries
    can be retrieved at any point and used to affect the outcome of any geometric
    operation using pre-specified rules.

    applications in the Architecture, Construction, and Engineering sector. Topologic
    has been used in the conceptual design phase to analyse a project before the complexity
    of building information modelling (BIM) sets in. Calculations of areas, volumes,
    centrality, congestion, and fit to adjacency requirements can all be conducted
    at an early stage in the design process. Topologic models with their inherent
    connectivity are also highly compatible with the input requirements of energy
    and structural analysis engines. One of the early applications of Topologic is
    Topologic Energy, which converts a Topologic model into a Building Energy Model
    (BEM) for analysis in openstudio/EnergyPlus [[5](#CR5)].

    first approach, on top of which other information is overlayed, whether this is
    for energy usage, structural analysis or other. This makes Topologic highly useful
    in our model of collective digital factories for buildings as compared to a full
    BIM approach it allows the use of JSON files which are highly compatible with
    SC/BC, but also from an information data-wrangling perspective makes the development
    of variants of architectural design solutions more elegant than full BIM model
    approaches.

    Key parameters of performance of these models are measured and recorded on a “continuous

    allowing essentially the design agents to earn a higher value of the fund against

    be swapped with the proportion of the funds that they can claim.

    teams in the AEC industry, that operates through stigmergic coordination, directly
    connecting the value of architectural design with carbon and waste reduction and
    productivity increase. The tight integration between tools such as Topologic and
    SC on a blockchain is key for our mechanisms, while the novelty lies in not only
    connecting carbon and waste reduction and increase in productivity with value
    in name only but directly through cryptoeconomics. The use of Topologic instead
    of a full BIM solution, allows for the creation of nimble, fast, accurate design
    iterations early in the design phase of the building, minimising the investment
    in time and effort that is frequently needed for developing full BIM models to
    test design solutions [[26](#CR26)]. Further, our solution can be expanded to
    the whole lifecycle of a building incentivising full AEC teams for a particular
    performance, and shifting the value from immediate task-based gains to a better
    performance of the design and built asset. The intricacies of the mechanisms involved
    in the token design, have been modelled and proof-tested already in decentralised
    finance applications, however, the capital and entrenched structure of AEC projects
    make it difficult to test the mechanisms in a real project. Still our model, we
    posit, provides another step forward in proofing the validity of using cryptoeconomics
    in incentivising a better-built environment.
