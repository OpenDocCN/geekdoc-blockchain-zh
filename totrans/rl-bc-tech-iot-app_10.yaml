    systems/practices to achieve a new paradigm of supply chain. The chapter identifies
    immediate challenges in various realms of supply chain ranging from product or
    order tracking, traceability and recall, counterfeiting, agri supply chain, automotive
    supply chain, digital homes, offices and warehouses to manufacturing and distribution
    supply chain. Elaborating the key features and capabilities of IOT and Blockchain
    it explains with example how the combination of these two powerful technologies
    along with peripherals systems and backbone ERPs can solve the listed business
    problems. It explores the process flows, technical architecture and business impacts
    with the IOT and Blockchain combination. The chapter ends with listing of the
    economic value and cost savings, the IOT Blockchain combination brings to supply
    chain and the opportunities lying in future.

- en: Supply chain in today's globalized economy is complex. A product sold in retail
    or online is designed by teams in more than one location, manufactured at some
    place, stored somewhere and delivered everywhere. Products pass through various
    countries, warehouses, weather conditions, handling methods, and storage situations
    before being delivered to end consumers. The physical realms of product flow have
    a twin with the digital aspect of the information flow. As more technological
    advancements are made this digital information is becoming more and more important.
    The timely availability of these information in a secure, transparent and structured
    way is key to faster and more accurate decision making and along with it the ability
    to save cost and judicious use of resources.

    A product from its concept or raw material to it featuring on the shelf or web
    portal generates enormous amount of data. Channelizing these data to analyze for
    future improvement, decision making and cost reduction is the direction and intent
    of every supply chain leader. Numerous components of a finished products, plethora
    of sourcing options, varied geographical and climatic conditions, storage situations,
    real time tracking need and physical handling makes it essential to track and
    monitor the physical, climatic and warehousing conditions. All these are only
    possible when the information is secure, structured, real time and easily available.

    move ahead in the digital journey there are systems within an organization like
    ERP, MRP, WMS, CRM which improves the organizations processes driving efficiency
    reducing cost and helping it function better. But it is the ability to interact
    and communicate across organizations seamlessly that can really drive benefits
    for decision making and other aspects. Focus is slowly moving from inter-organization
    data interactions to data interactions with physical machines and other realms.
    Today most of the inter-organization communications are driven by EDI, B2B messaging
    and manual reports and there is no mechanism of communicating with machines and
    other physical realms like pressure, temperature, etc. The inter-organization
    communications in these technologies are neither reliable or real time nor secure.
    These are mostly batch processed, needs manual interventions and comes with its
    own plethora of limitations. This chapter looks at the challenges faced by different
    type of supply chain with these existing technologies and how the modern and mature
    technology of blockchain with the internet of things (IOT) capability will solve
    the problems, drive efficiency and reduce cost.

    as per demand. For example, a company manufacturing routers receives a demand
    from its customers. The demand is transferred to a contract manufacturer to be
    shipped to a warehouse. The product is shipped by contract manufacturer through
    a logistics service provider. The product reaches the warehouse of the company
    which is then shipped to customer. Due to multiple stakeholders in this demand/supply
    transaction the real time information sharing is a challenge. What these companies
    do is to use reports and EDI/B2B messaging which provides information of product
    reaching or leaving a certain location. What happens in between is an information
    void. Similar information disconnects is there for pharmaceutical and food industry
    also. Most of the current/existing solutions for tracing uses a warehouse management
    solution along with RFI tags [[4]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0025). This is information

    degradation of products and medicines, the US Food and Drug administrator (FDA)
    has issued Drug Supply chain and Security Act (DSCSA). The act mandates that all
    manufacturer, distributor and third party logistics provider develop an electronic
    and interoperable system to track medicines. This calls for an almost real time
    and highly secure data interchange which can be analyzed any time. Similarly,
    US FDA mandates the manufacturer to recall products ASAP from customers if US
    FDA has already asked for it (before it damages customer). Manufactures today
    have very limited access or information to end customer. Counterfeiting of products
    is another supply chain challenge as its extremely difficult to figure out where
    the counterfeit products are injected into the supply chain. All these three scenarios
    ask for a secure real time capability to trace back products reliably and quickly.
    These challenges are constantly evolving with ecommerce and omni channel supply
    chains and there are very few credible solutions available in market to solve
    such problems.

    end with the retailer or consumption of the products at the hands of consumer.
    It is particularly complex for four reasons, first at the very beginning there
    is limited use of technology or sophistication as it lies with farmers, second
    most of the times the products undergo multiple transformations unless it is directly
    consumed, third it has multiple stake holders or value chain members with varied
    levels of sophistication, and finally it is particularly long and spans across
    time and geography. For a given end product uniquely identifying land of harvest,
    knowing the farmer who grew it and the environmental impacts of crop grown, farming
    practices for the crop, crop yield, fertilizers used, type of soil preparation,
    are of particular interest to many governmental agencies, retailers and even consumers
    [[4]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0025). With the lengthy supply chain and final
    consumer being oblivious to the upstream complexity it is not only intricate but

    is autonomous cars and second is connected cars. Of the two it is the connected
    cars that is fast evolving, greatly transforming and can potentially disrupt the
    automotive supply chain. The concept of connected cars, i.e., cars connected to
    internet and sending data to cloud transmitting car function and other allied
    information can open up various options for car owners and other members of the
    automotive value chain. These include but not limited to predictive maintenance,
    car infotainment, safety, security, recall, drive information, advanced navigation,
    customer insights and insurance information. The new cars sold that will be connected
    to the Internet are predicted to rise to 98% by 2020 [[5]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0030).
    Today the connected cars are restricted to the OEMs partnering with technology
    companies. Example Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi are slated to roll out Microsoft
    and Android connected vehicles by 2021 [[6]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0035).
    But the actual supply chain benefits lie when the automotive partners like dealers,
    service companies, component manufacturers and insurance companies are connected.
    They have access to the same data source and then can take decisions or reach
    out to owners helping them save money, time and giving them better experience.
    These are sensitive information and are complex to capture, connect and share

    quality of life and maximizes security. As the market is currently immature and
    evolving, the real benefit of smart homes or offices will come when the hardware
    manufacturer, consumer electronics, retail outlets, software and ecosystem developers,
    utility service providers and home security solutions are all connected. The connects
    has to move from devices to devices and service to service. It is a case where
    individually the products are being developed and the need is to have a holistic
    look and bring players/partners together. Lack of a mature technology is resisting

    Trust between distributor and supplier for availability of products, for price
    of a product in a specific country/geography or for a segment of a customer or
    for the shipment of the goods should be irrefutable. Apart from these another
    area of trust unique to distribution industry is ship and debit claims. Today
    the major challenge is the ship and debit claim is the manual reconciliation done
    at both the supplier and distributors end. Volume and complexity in claims leads
    to millions of dollars stuck in claims for distributors. The claim always suffers
    from trust deficit for products shipped and received, onhand, price discrepancy,
    agreements value, etc. Point of Sale reporting is another piece of the zigsaw
    of distribution industry which drives quite a few monetary decisions like commissions,
    volume rebates, etc., and suffers because of trust and transparency deficit. Most
    of these problems are solved today through manual interventions, reports, discussion
    and emails. This is primarily because there is limited to no inter-company technology
    platform. EDI, B2B messaging doesn't helps solve these problems. So every distributor
    needs a solution for this problem and in need of a mature technology to bridge
    this gap.

    from the way over the years manufacturing has evolved with global supply chains
    and localization of products. It is the real time integration among partners which
    has forced companies and products managers to look for ways to share data for
    analysis. This has given rise to consideration of data security, data transparency,
    data access and real time decision making based on accurate and untampered data.
    This has given rise to the needs of digital twins which helps simulate real world
    impacts/actions to improve the physical world with a simulation in cyber world
    [[7]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0040). Real time decision making in multi-partner
    eco system and digital twins for manufacturing are only possible when there is
    a safe, transparent and secure data sharing and availability mechanism. Today
    such real time data sharing and digital twins are not so prevalent due to lack

    chain strategy it is very evident from the discussion above that to serve customer
    and to have an effective decision making there is a need for smooth inter-organization
    data sharing. Today these are managed in some way or the other and the way those
    are managed will pave way to understand how it can be solved with better use of
    technology. Order tracking and product traceability are currently managed through
    EDI/messaging system and also through reports and gated scans at various check
    points. This indicates that the need of the future system is to provide the data
    like these scans real time from anywhere. Similarly, EDI/messaging system hints
    that the information has to reach the correct and exact destination so that informed
    decisions can be taken. Agri supply chain struggles with lack of adoption of technology
    at grass root level. This may be due to ease of use, lack of technology provisioning
    and cost. Due to this the intended transparency of crops, land use, environmental
    impacts are missing from most of the products. The capture of grass root data
    and sharing of these data transparently and securely across multiple agencies
    are a challenge today which restricts the agri supply chain and its information
    being available at the hands of end consumer. Same is the challenge for digital
    automotive, digital homes, distribution and manufacturing that are challenged
    by real time capturing and sharing of data securely across multiple agencies/stakeholder
    and analyzing these in the digital twins. All these indicate that the need of
    the hour from technology is to provide a means and mechanism of capturing data
    safely and transmitting it to multiple stakeholders securely and maintaining the
    transparency. This chapter further explores the technology of Internet of Things
    and its combination with Blockchain as a credible and mature solution mechanism

    Characteristically these can be separated as, first is the ability to capture
    data real time from the source, uninterrupted so that the data is transformed
    from physical to cyber world seamlessly. It has to be cost effective and it has
    to be completely human, system, operations and process agnostic. Second, the data
    captured has to be secured to the best extent possible. The data should be impeccable,
    trustworthy and untampered. Third, there has to be a seamless mechanism to share
    this data almost real time across enterprises/partners without any process dependency
    and minimal additional cost. The need for all the three requirements is forcing
    enterprises to look beyond the existing mechanism of ERP systems, point to point
    interfaces, EDI, messaging systems and reporting. This is where the newer technology
    and its mechanism, architecture and maturity comes to fore. For the discussed
    challenges in supply chain and the way things are handled today it is the use
    of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based Blockchain system along with the
    Internet of Things (IOT) that can solve most of the problems. The technical capability
    and architecture of data capture, storage, security and distribution greatly supports
    this combination. This combination can also provide many unforeseen benefits like
    seamless synchronization, real time analytics and mobility aspects to data.

    ledger technology. Blockchain network of systems records transactions as blocks
    and are Immutable and Secure (to a great extent) and chronologically maintains
    the data blocks across transactions. These blocks of data are shared among a number
    of computers/nodes rather than being stored on a central server. The blockchain
    can also be described as an incorruptible digital ledger of transactions that
    are programmed to record. Blockchain can tokenize a physical product into a virtual/digital
    token. One of the powerful features of Blockchain is on the controlled data access
    to certain members only based on smart contracts. In blockchain the transaction
    data can be verified by rules (smart contracts) unlike a single centralized authority.
    The biggest benefit of Blockchain is the ability to seamlessly and securely share
    data with partner organizations.

    The open blockchain network generally do not work if the network is for a specific
    purpose or by a specific owning organization. This blockchain architecture works
    on the consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanisms are drawn through the Proof
    of Work. The proof of work drives the need for authenticators or miners. These
    play a crucial role as they are the gatekeepers who onboard members, verify transactions
    and calculate credits. This architecture requires significant computational power
    to maintain a large-scale distributed ledger and standardize calculations among
    numerous participants and authenticators. Due to this challenge, open blockchain
    architecture is not so readily acceptable. Though Bitcoin network is one of the

    for other members. Smart contracts are rules defined to engagement among members.
    These standardized and well-defined criteria are the cornerstone of the permissioned

    conceptual architecture for supply chain solutions. It can be seen that it brings

    with data being captured from various systems through the IOT mechanism. The data
    captured can be anything from physical or environmental data to product specific
    data. This figure depicts a cloud based blockchain architecture. The genesis of
    the architecture lies in capture of data through any kind of mechanism like sensors
    or RFIDs and transmitting it to the gateway. The gateway will submit the data
    to the blockchain. In this architecture the data captured by IOT is directly fed
    into blockchain with no intermediate data storage. This architecture has no IOT
    platform as such to store data and then transmitting it to blockchain system.
    Thus this architecture eliminates the need for infrastructure for captured data
    in IOT platform. On the contrary because of a lack of IOT platform, data cannot
    be encrypted before transferring over the network with only possibility of basic
    authentication. Having an IOT platform can help with advanced authentication and
    encryption before transfer over the network. The architecture as depicted in [Fig.

- en: Product/Order Tracking and Product Traceability/Recall/Anti-Counterfeiting—These
    are two of the supply chain challenges identified. The solution to both these
    problems is very similar. The main challenge in product tracking and traceability
    in supply chain are multiple stakeholders, real time tracking of physical goods
    movements information across stakeholders and ability to trace back ownership
    at any given point in time in the life cycle of the product. This information
    is not only needed and worthy for stakeholders within the supply chain but also
    for end customers who want real time information of its demand. The information
    voids in these areas are transparency and losing customer satisfaction. The combination
    of Blockchain and IOT can help track the information of physical goods movement
    in the supply network and make it available to any stakeholder. This can provide
    the information reliably, real time and in a controlled way which are otherwise
    not possible. The core of the solution lies in having sensors at various key supply
    chain cardinal points which can capture the deemed information and transmit it
    to a cloud based gateway system which will ultimately transmit it to a blockchain
    network. The data once available in blockchain network can then be securely shared
    across partners using smart contracts thus bringing in control and authenticity.
    Smart contracts can decide the level of access and information to partners.

    can greatly help bridge this important gap. The sensors in the trucks/ocean freight,
    warehouse can capture the physical storage conditions and make it available in
    blockchain network. Based on smart contracts various partners can access this

    IOT sensors can help track this when the transaction happens. Storing them in
    blockchain will help establish provenance and traceability to any stakeholder
    as per the smart contracts to access data. During manufacturing and after, the
    status of various environmental/physical and product related attributes can help
    determine the quality of final product, its freshness and other characteristics
    at the hands of consumer. Aberrations during manufacturing (in cases of baby products)
    can be really dangerous and today this information is not available. With the

    is in home security. Currently these systems do not operate over a blockchain
    system and thus cannot give partial access to someone or a pin pointed access
    to a neighbor. To achieve this the use of IOT and Blockchain for a stringent and
    flexible authentication is required. Blockchain system will hold the smart contracts
    to enable or deny login to a particular user. The smart contracts (in Blockchain)
    along with IOT can also enable partial access to house or office. Comcast in the
    United States is already experimenting with the use of IOT and Blockchain for
    security systems [[20]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0105) for partial and temporary
    accesses in home security. But what is to be noted is these are still in silos
    of the company (provider of service).

    in home/office/warehouse lighting, temperature and alarms controls. These ranges
    from continuous monitoring of temperature and lighting to alarm setting as per
    the need of the consumer. The ability to remotely manage temperature, alarms,
    smoke detectors, lighting devices, refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers,
    etc. are the key goals of the devices today. These devices are working independently
    and in silos. These systems are focused on the purpose of automation and information
    dissipation to consumers today. The need of the hour is to bring them together
    so that they can lead the next generation of service. These can be to connect
    these devices to utility company for bill settlement or root cause for electrical
    faults. There can be capabilities developed to connect the retail stores with
    washing machine or dishwashers for placing orders on detergents or washing pods
    seamlessly with/without user intervention. An alarm in one system can be a helpful
    information for other system also like a drop in temperature can be an indicator
    for security breach or a fire alarm can be a good information to utility service
    provider. Similarly, if the security information and other aspects like detectors
    and controls are transparent to insurance companies it will help them provide
    better coverage and ultimately save cost to consumers.

    and services from lighting, temperature, washing machine, refrigerator, dish washer,
    alarms and controls for homes, offices and warehouses. The real benefits will
    start to surface when with one system or application will be able to control everything
    smart at home or office. This application will be based on an integrated IOT and
    blockchain platform system rather than an individual application. IOT in these
    cases will play a critical role as it is the sensor which will pick up aberrations
    to trigger alarms or other actions. The data being available in blockchain will
    help harmonize and cross reference it across systems (bringing in transparency).

- en: Manufacturing is globalized today. It has multiple partners spread across geographies.
    It is very important that these manufacturing systems are synchronized. Due to
    multiplicity of the partners it is almost impossible to bring all of them in the
    same information platform unless it is driven by blockchain. IOT system for data
    capture and Blockchain network for data repository is an all-powerful combination
    that can revolutionize the manufacturing systems. [Fig. 6](S0065245819300336.xhtml#f0035)
    depicts a high level architecture of how multiple ERP systems from multiple partners
    can be brought together using IOT/Blockchain combination. This figure helps us
    understand the distinct role of IOT to capture data from individual ERP and transmitting
    them to blockchain network. The figure also depicts the data can be captured directly
    from ERP system and interfaced to blockchain (without IOT). The data captured
    from IOT systems can be like those of shipping, logistics, production output,
    manufacturing lines problem, material quality issues, etc. The data captured (without
    IOT) from the ERP system could be like orders, supply, master data and those can
    be directly fed to blockchain. Blockchain system makes the data, partner and platform
    independent and make its availability seamless for any analysis or decision making.
    For example, as shown in [Fig. 6](S0065245819300336.xhtml#f0035) the supply information
    from ERP like the on hand, work in process data, manufacturing problems from sub-assembly
    plant (plant 1) is a critical piece of information to multiple partners if it's
    a feeder plant to multiple assembly plants (like plant 2). This is where the information
    captured through IOT and available in blockchain will need to be individual plant
    system independent and available for every supply chain partner. Smart contracts
    and controlled access of data to partners can be enabled in blockchain network.
    These all will be possible from this IOT Blockchain solution.

    boilers it is the digital twins which is the need of the hours. Digital twins
    are virtual replicas of physical devices to run simulations. Digital twin is a
    computer program, that takes real-world data about a physical object or system
    as inputs and produces outputs predications or simulations of how that physical
    object or system will be affected by those inputs. Digital twins exist only because
    of IOT systems. IOT sensors are placed on the physical device and they transmit
    the data which is used for analysis. These data can be the status of the system
    or action of some inputs. If these data are transmitted to the blockchain then
    it will help make it available to partners as per their access and will democratize
    the data for analysis from different partners as per their expertise. Most of
    the major manufacturing companies like GE, Chevron, Schneider Electric have already
    invested in digital twins and are benefitting in millions from it [[21]](S0065245819300336.xhtml#bb0110).

    chain solution. Obviously there is an amount of investment associated with its
    establishment, process definition and implementation. But once it is implemented
    it can help reduce cost by getting rid of peripheral systems, reducing human dependency,
    eliminate redundant processes, simplifying warehousing processes and automating
    supply chain processes which are reports and human driven. It can also help bolster
    brand value with ability to track and trace, establishing provenance and smoother
    recalls. It can also boost revenue with unlocking of opportunities which were
    not possible due to systems working in silos. With synchronized products and services
    across segments and the adoption of a single platform for supply chain with backbone

    in any field. In supply chain and logistics, it can derive significant benefit
    with the combined architecture of IOT, blockchain and other supply chain systems
    like ERP. The architecture presented is generic and can help any type of supply
    chain orchestration and few specifics are highlighted and discussed. The chapter
    individually discusses the problem faced today in agri supply chain, auto supply
    chain, product or order tracking, traceability and recall, counterfeiting, digital
    homes, manufacturing and distribution supply chain and how these challenges can
    be solved with the IOT Blockchain combination. Ranging from generic supply chain
    flows to specific agri or automotive supply chain the benefits are similar in
    eliminating the intermediaries, bringing in transparency and establishing provenance
    or tracking it to the detailed level. Blockchain and IOT as a technology are maturing
    and growing together. They are codependent on one another and stands maximum changes
    of development with both being together. IOT desperately needs the blockchain's
    features as it brings in security, immutability and smart contracts while the
    blockchain is in need of IOT to channelize the feed of data to convert every aspect
    as a big-time opportunity for supply chain to become more effective. IOT Blockchain
    combination will revolutionize the supply chain in the way the partners interact
    today. The combination will add value to products, invoke trust among partners,
    reduce supply chain cost, improve process efficiency, avoid information voids
    and empower customers.
