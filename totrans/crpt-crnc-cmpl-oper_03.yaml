    the fund will actually operate once it has raised capital from investors. These
    operational mechanics of the fund will not only include understanding the ways
    in which actual crypto investments will be made or traded but also the post-trade
    operations and associated fund accounting. Additionally, there are a number of
    other operational aspects involved in running a crypto fund ranging from establishing
    procedures for the use and maintenance of information technology assets to human
    capital considerations such as processing employee payroll.

- en: As a general guideline, for both operational and compliance policies and procedures
    the best time to start thinking about what the content of these policies will
    be is before the fund is actually launched (i.e., during the pre-launch phase).
    In practice, however, these policies will not be put into practice until the fund
    has actually been formed. While some policies, such as compliance restrictions
    and recordkeeping regarding investor outreach at the initial fund raising stages,
    in practice the bulk of operational policies and procedures will be utilized on
    a going forward basis only after the fund has started trading in the crypto markets.
    For reference fund compliance procedures are discussed in more detail in Chapter
    [4](513667_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml).

    an ***operations manual*** or ***operating manual***. The goal of an operations
    manual is to outline a general set of operating guideposts that the fund will
    follow as it operates. When drafting an operations manual the goal should not
    be to develop protocols to address every potential operational challenge that
    may develop but rather to provide a general framework to address key operating
    areas of the firm. In some instances, a crypto fund may opt to develop an operations
    manual that is more formal and high level in its focus and then supplement the
    specific nuts and bolts of more specific operational procedures with less formal
    documentation.

    the unique circumstances surrounding each crypto fund, there are a general list
    of items that every operations manual should generally cover. Once again if a
    crypto fund opts to put one of these items into a smaller stand-alone manual or
    combine policies related to a specific operational item into a different manual,
    such as a compliance manual, this is also acceptable. The important thing to remember
    is in practice it doesn’t matter whether the policies and procedures related to
    a particular operational area are placed in a document labeled, “operating manual,”
    or are instead covered in a different manual, but rather that the crypto fund
    has developed a policy with regard to the particular operational area in question
    as opposed to not addressing it in any form.

    of a crypto fund is that it has capital to invest. This is why the process of
    raising and holding onto capital is so essential. Once a crypto fund raises capital
    and receives inflows of capital from investors, the next step is for the fund
    manager to actually invest the money into the crypto markets in line with the
    fund’s investment strategy.

    the retail world, an investor would simply establish a brokerage account at a
    crypto exchange, fund the account, pick which cryptocurrencies they would like
    to invest in, and then allocate their capital accordingly. A crypto-asset manager
    effectively does the same thing in a more formalized way. Compared to a retail
    crypto investor, the crypto fund manager also generally deploys capital, utilizes
    more crypto exchange partners and works with more service providers to support
    the trading process.

    a ***pre-trade process*** that it follows. The first step in this process would
    be for the crypto fund’s investment strategy to be utilized to construct a list
    of cryptocurrencies that the fund is allowed to invest in to form what is known
    as an ***investible universe*** or ***investment universe***. This list could
    be a definitive list of cryptocurrencies or instead a general list of desired
    characteristics of cryptocurrencies that would be eligible to be part of the investible
    universe. An example of the latter would be large market cap cryptocurrencies
    with an operating history of over five years and offered on at least four exchanges
    for trading. Based on this example, a number of coins would be excluded from this
    particular fund’s investment universe and therefore, the crypto fund would not
    be able to invest in them without revising its guidelines or making a documented
    trading exception.

    thesis is commonly known as ***trade idea generation***.

- en: An example of trade idea generation would be an investment analyst that proposes
    that the crypto fund they work for should go long Bitcoin and short Ethereum when
    the correlation between the two drops below 0.90 during any time in the next three
    months. We don’t know if this will be a profitable strategy or not, but this is
    the strategy that is being proposed at this point based on factors such as the
    investment analyst's research and trading intuition.

- en: After a trade idea has been generated the person proposing the strategy typically
    documents the trading idea in what is known as an ***investment memorandum***.
    This memorandum is then typically circulated to senior investment personnel in
    the crypto fund for review. In many cases, a select group of these individuals,
    including the CIO, would then likely vote as to whether or not they would like
    to go ahead with this strategy. These groups of people are commonly referred to
    as an ***investment committee****.* Firms can employ different governance structures
    regarding the way these voting mechanisms work. For example, some crypto funds
    may follow a policy that all votes need to be unanimous in favor of proceeding
    with the investment strategy otherwise it is not approved. Others may follow a
    policy that a majority is only required instead of unanimity. When this is the
    case, typically the CIO must be one of the individuals voting in favor of proceeding
    with the strategy.

  zh: 在生成交易想法之后，提出策略的人通常会在所谓的***投资备忘录***中记录交易想法。这份备忘录通常会发送给加密货币基金的高级投资人员进行审查。在许多情况下，包括首席投资官在内的这些人的一组人可能会投票决定是否愿意实施这个策略。这些人群通常被称为***投资委员会***。公司可以采用不同的治理结构，关于这些投票机制的方式。例如，一些加密货币基金可能遵循的政策是所有投票都需要一致同意才能进行投资策略，否则就不会批准。其他人可能遵循的政策是只需要多数票，而不是一致性。在这种情况下，通常首席投资官必须是投票支持进行策略的人之一。
- en: Assuming that the investment committee approves the proposal, then a ***trading
    strategy*** must be developed. A trading strategy is different than trade idea
    generation in that a trading strategy focuses on the most successful way for the
    fund manager to execute their trades. There are many different measures of success
    in trading depending on the priorities of the firm. For example, if a crypt fund
    is purchasing a position for the first time, known as ***initiating a position***,
    in a newly launched highly desirable low market cap cryptocurrency, then the measure
    of success for the crypto-asset manager in this instance may be merely making
    a purchase of the cryptocurrency in question. In other instances, for a highly
    liquid cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, the measure of trading success
    may be the speed at which the trades are executed in order to reduce what is known
    as ***slippage***, the difference between the desired price versus the price at
    which the trade actually occurred. Another consideration could be the cost of
    executing the trades and whether or not measures were taken to minimize costs
    or instead work with brokers who may charge higher fees but may provide additional
    value-added services such as investment research. In practice, many investment
    firms maintain a committee known as the best execution committee, to review the
    success of the trading strategies being employed by the funds. This review process
    can include utilizing a scoring system for different exchanges and brokers and
    then utilizing these scores going forward to determine which brokers the funds
    will show preference to when executing future trades.

  zh: 假设投资委员会批准了该提案，那么必须制定一个***交易策略***。交易策略与交易想法的生成不同，交易策略关注的是基金经理执行交易的最成功方式。根据公司的优先级，交易中有许多不同的成功标准。例如，如果一个加密货币基金首次购买一个被称为***初始化持仓***的位置，在一个新推出的市值低且非常受欢迎的加密货币中，那么在这种情况下，加密货币资产管理者成功的衡量标准仅仅是购买了所说的加密货币。在其他情况下，对于像比特币或以太坊这样的高流动性加密货币，交易成功的衡量标准可能是交易的执行速度，以减少所谓的***滑点***，即
    desired price 与实际交易价格之间的差异。另一个考虑因素可能是执行交易的费用，以及是否采取了减少成本的措施，或者与可能收费较高但可能提供额外增值服务的经纪人合作。实际上，许多投资公司维持一个名为最佳执行委员会的组织，以审查基金正在使用的交易策略的成功情况。这个审查过程可以包括利用不同的交易所和经纪人的评分系统，然后利用这些分数来决定基金在执行未来交易时会偏向哪些经纪人。

    and very cost-effective, these types of systems present a great deal of operational
    risk to the crypto fund in large part due to their highly manual nature. Other
    more sophisticated, and generally larger, crypto funds employ complex proprietary
    trading systems they developed themselves or they purchase third-party trading
    systems commonly referred to as order management systems (OMS) to capture trade
    information. By loading the information into the pre-trade blotter, often the
    OMS will have built in a number of operational checks to ensure that the fund’s
    systems are accurately set up in order to handle the proposed trade.

    new cryptocurrencies that are within the investible universe but that have not

    must be undertaken from an operational perspective in order to properly set up
    the new cryptocurrency. If the OMS is not able to process the trade, the pre-trade
    operations checks would typically produce an alert to the trader and senior operational
    professionals, such as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and then the situation
    could be further investigated or rectified. Additionally, it should be noted that
    the OMS may also facilitate the use of pre-trade compliance checks. For reference

    simply referred to as a ***blockchain transaction***, are trades or transactions
    that actually occur on the blockchain themselves. In order for the transactions

    and then the public ledger would be subsequently updated with evidence of the
    transaction. Another method is known as an ***off-chain transaction***. These
    trades or transactions do not happen on the blockchain but instead outside of
    it. In practice there is often an interaction of the on-chain and off-chain models,

    tokens that is created by on-chain smart contracts that also implement the trade
    execution and subsequent trade settlement procedures.[¹](#FPar1) Buy and sell

- en: It should be noted that a crypto fund manager may trade directly with another
    counterparty, in what is known as an ***off-exchange trade***. When these types
    of trades take place, it is often common for a broker, commonly referred to as
    a ***clearing broker***, to assist in facilitating the transaction. The use of
    a broker that effectively sits between the two parties, as opposed to having the
    two parties trade directly with each other, can help to reduce counterparty risk
    in the overall transaction in a number of ways. An example of this would be if
    the broker holds the cryptocurrencies and fiat in escrow for each counterparty.
    Another example would be if the broker facilitates trade settlement as well as
    protecting the identities of the counterparties from each other if so desired.
    Other services that can be performed by brokers in off-exchange trades can include
    facilitating any pre- and post-trade compliance checks in areas such as anti-money
    laundering (AML).

    are exchanged between trading counterparties. In the traditional finance world,
    securities such as equities do not settle instantly but instead the settlement
    date occurs after the trade date. For equity trades in particular the common settlement
    period is three business days after the trade date. The common convention for
    writing this is to say that equity trades settle on a T+3 basis, where “T” is
    used to denote the trade date.

    known as ***trade reconciliation***. This process refers to the operational procedures
    by which a crypto-asset manager, or their designated service provider, compares
    the specific detail of a trade with other parties to the trading. The goal of
    this is to ensure that all parties to the crypto trade maintain the same details
    of the trade. Therefore, while trade settlement compares the trade details on
    a pre-trade basis, the trade reconciliation compares trade details on a post-trade
    basis. These pre- and post-trade checks are important because discrepancies can
    lead to the incorrect amount of money and crypto securities being transferred
    among the parties to a trade. These types of errors could have further detrimental

    Other crypto funds may instead choose to allow redemptions during an investor’s

    purpose of the penalty is to discourage investors from redeeming during the soft

    fee based on fund AUM. For reference 1 basis point is equal to 0.0001 or 1/100th

    8 bps a month on $1 million of your crypto fund’s assets at launch. Therefore,
    8bps on $10 million would be a fee of $800 per month for the administrator. In
    practice, however, many administrators require a minimum fee to be met on a monthly
    basis that may exceed the purely calculated basis points fee (i.e., the $800 in
    our example). For example, if the administrator required $2,000 per month as the
    minimum fee, then the monthly administration fee for your crypto fund at launch

- en: As assets under management for your fund rose the calculated basis point fee
    would continue to rise. Continuing our example at $30 million of assets under
    management the calculated 8bps administration fee would be $24,000 per month which
    would meet the minimum fee required by the administrator. With this minimum met,
    above $30 million the new higher fee (i.e., above the $3,000 minimum) would be
    applied. These fees do not scale uniformly in perpetuity. Instead, most fund administrators
    typically employ a reduced basis points fee as fund’s assets under management
    increase beyond certain predetermined levels. This is known as a **sliding scale
    fee model**.

    above $30 million the new higher fee (i.e., above the $3,000 minimum) would be

    by investors in the fund. Despite the fact that investors are the ones effectively
    paying for the administrator, the administrator often defers to the fund manager
    and not investors in most instances.[³](#FPar1) Although this structure is very

    by banks that work in the crypto space can vary greatly with some as low as $50,000
    or less up to $250,000 or more. In general, banks perceive crypto as higher risk

- en: Different banks apply rules regarding minimum balances differently. Some banks
    will apply a flat figure that they want an account or accounts as applicable to
    maintain at all times. The way this would work in practice would be that the bank
    would require the crypto fund to maintain a set amount of cash, such as $50,000,
    in the account at all times. This would be a requirement to maintain the account
    in good standing. If the cash balance in the crypto fund account went below $50,000
    then the bank may have the right to terminate the account or subject the fund’s
    bank account to additional substantial fees. Other banks may apply an average
    monthly balance rule. Under this methodology, the average of cash throughout the
    month in an account must exceed a certain threshold. This means that throughout
    the month the balance can go above and below a certain amount, such as $50,000

    substantial 费用。其他银行可能会应用平均月余额规则。根据这种方法，账户中整个月现金的平均数额必须超过某个阈值。这意味着整个月份，余额可以高于或低于某个数额，比如5万美元这个数字，只要平均余额高于5万美元即可。

    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This fee, sometimes called an FDIC
    assessment, essentially lowers the earnings credit that a bank offers on balances
    in the account. The FDIC assessment is often quoted in basis points. A basis point
    is one-hundredth of a percent, and is often abbreviated as, “bps.” The impact
    of the FDIC assessment is often viewed in conjunction with the earnings credit
    for the crypto fund and management company bank accounts. Specifically, the earnings
    credit is the soft dollar credit applied against monthly fees. Additionally, both
    the earnings credit and FDIC assessment are typically based on average collected
    balances each month. For example, let us consider if the earnings credit rate
    is 16 bps and the FDIC assessment fee was 14 bps. The net earnings credit therefore

- en: An important consideration when utilizing a custodian for a crypto-asset manager
    is the method used by the custodian to hold the asset of the crypto fund. Historically,
    in the world of traditional finance, some custodians would hold fund assets in
    the name of their own custodian firm. This is referred to as a ***non-segregated
    custodial relationship*** because the assets of the crypto fud manager are not
    segregated from the assets of the custodian, This type of relationship potentially
    exposes the assets held by the custodian to a larger degree of counterparty risk.
    The reason for this is because if the custodian should then itself fail, then
    as part of the insolvency procedures the fund’s assets could be repossessed and
    taken away to pay the custodians debtors. This type of situation would result
    in the crypto fund’s assets being effectively unrecoverable. To avoid these types
    of problems, and minimize unnecessary counterparty exposure, it is generally therefore
    considered to be a preferable option for a custodian to not hold in the name of
    the custodian, but rather in the name of the fund itself. This type of arrangement
    is referred to as a ***segregated custodial relationship*** because the crypto
    fund’s assets are segregated from the assets of the custodian.

    Outside of crypto-specific considerations, the term ***arbitrage*** means a riskless

    Arbitrage strategies have historically been particularly popular in the hedge
    fund space. Examples of common hedge fund arbitrage strategies include regulatory
    arbitrage, relative value arbitrage and convertible bond arbitrage. Many crypto
    arbitrage strategies commonly employ similar trading techniques to hedge fund
    arbitrage strategies. It should be clarified that many of the crypto and hedge
    fund strategies that utilize the term arbitrage are not actually riskless in nature

    to select to service your crypto fund and management company, the next stage is
    to actually hire them. As we outlined above with regard to the fund administrator,
    as part of this process you will need to enter into a contract with the firms.
    This contract can come in different forms depending on the service provider in
    question. For example, a law firm will not typically provide you with a detailed
    contract per se but rather an engagement letter that outlines the various services
    that will be provided to support the fund launch and the associated hourly fees
    for ongoing and additional work. Other vendors such as the fund administrator
    will typically provide a more traditional long-form contract.
  id: totrans-155

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the contract, which is often full of highly technical legal language
    and disclaimers, the other document you will typically be asked to sign is something
    known as a service level agreement (SLA). Similar to the engagement letter from
    a law firm discussed above, the purpose of the SLA is to describe in more straightforward
    language the scope of services that a vendor will provide for your crypto fund.
    To illustrate the difference between the contract and SLA let us consider a description
    of the monthly reconciliation services that could be provided by a fund administrator.
    The contract may describe the services as follows, “The Fund Administrator (or
    ‘Administrator’) will provide services in their discretion including but not limited
    to the preparation of reconciliation and related services in a frequency as mutually
    agreed upon between the crypto manager and the Administrator.” While technically
    accurate from a legal perspective this is not necessarily clear to non-legal personnel
    or specific enough to really understand how frequently the fund administrator
    may be performing reconciliations. The SLA on the other hand could describe the
    services as follows, “The Fund Administrator will perform monthly reconciliation
    service for the crypto fund.” This is much more straightforward and understandable.
    To be clear there is nothing wrong with the more technical legal language contained
    in the contract, however, it serves a different purpose than the more straightforward
    SLA.

    you fully understand all the services being described as well as the proposed
    fees. Furthermore, it is often advisable to have your law firm review the contracts
    and service legal agreements proposed by the other vendors prior to your execution
    of them.

    proposed services, fees and ultimately contracts and SLAs from service providers
    you do not have to accept their terms as first described. As we have outlined
    above, different service providers offer a wide variety of different service levels
    and fees. You should shop around and potentially attempt to negotiate for lower
    fees or more advantageous terms for your crypto firm. The worst that can happen
    is that the vendor will reject your proposal, but if you don’t at least attempt
    to negotiate then you will have no opportunity to gain more in the deal. This
    is not to say you should over negotiate or simply pick the lowest priced vendor,
    but the point to remember is ultimately the vendor is competing for your business
    and therefore, you should ensure they are incentivized to make their pricing and
    services levels competitive with the rest of the marketplace.

- en: This chapter provided an introduction to the subject of operations for crypto-asset
    managers. It began with an overview with considerations for a crypto-asset manager
    developing operating policies and procedures. As part of this conversation, we
    discussed the process of creating an operations manual as well as the common topics
    covered in these manuals. This included a discussion of trade operations and controls
    ranging from pre-trade operational procedures through to specific trade implementation
    for cryptocurrencies and trade settlement. We next discussed operational considerations
    for crypto trading exchanges. As part of this discussion, we covered on-chain
    versus off-chain transactions and covered a decentralized exchange example. Other
    topics in this chapter included the onboarding process and operational roles of
    the fund administrator, bank and custodian. Now that we have established a fundamental
    understanding of crypto fund operations, in the next chapter we will expand our
    discussion to include compliance and governance considerations for crypto-asset
    managers.
