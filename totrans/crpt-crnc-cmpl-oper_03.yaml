    with service providers have been established the next step is to determine how
    the fund will actually operate once it has raised capital from investors. These
    operational mechanics of the fund will not only include understanding the ways
    in which actual crypto investments will be made or traded but also the post-trade
    operations and associated fund accounting. Additionally, there are a number of
    other operational aspects involved in running a crypto fund ranging from establishing
    procedures for the use and maintenance of information technology assets to human
    capital considerations such as processing employee payroll.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a general guideline, for both operational and compliance policies and procedures
    the best time to start thinking about what the content of these policies will
    be is before the fund is actually launched (i.e., during the pre-launch phase).
    In practice, however, these policies will not be put into practice until the fund
    has actually been formed. While some policies, such as compliance restrictions
    and recordkeeping regarding investor outreach at the initial fund raising stages,
    in practice the bulk of operational policies and procedures will be utilized on
    a going forward basis only after the fund has started trading in the crypto markets.
    For reference fund compliance procedures are discussed in more detail in Chapter
    [4](513667_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml).

- en: The first step in developing these procedures is to create what is known as
    an ***operations manual*** or ***operating manual***. The goal of an operations
    manual is to outline a general set of operating guideposts that the fund will
    follow as it operates. When drafting an operations manual the goal should not
    be to develop protocols to address every potential operational challenge that
    may develop but rather to provide a general framework to address key operating
    areas of the firm. In some instances, a crypto fund may opt to develop an operations
    manual that is more formal and high level in its focus and then supplement the
    specific nuts and bolts of more specific operational procedures with less formal
    documentation.

    the unique circumstances surrounding each crypto fund, there are a general list
    of items that every operations manual should generally cover. Once again if a
    crypto fund opts to put one of these items into a smaller stand-alone manual or
    combine policies related to a specific operational item into a different manual,
    such as a compliance manual, this is also acceptable. The important thing to remember
    is in practice it doesn’t matter whether the policies and procedures related to
    a particular operational area are placed in a document labeled, “operating manual,”
    or are instead covered in a different manual, but rather that the crypto fund
    has developed a policy with regard to the particular operational area in question
    as opposed to not addressing it in any form.

    of a crypto fund is that it has capital to invest. This is why the process of
    raising and holding onto capital is so essential. Once a crypto fund raises capital
    and receives inflows of capital from investors, the next step is for the fund
    manager to actually invest the money into the crypto markets in line with the
    fund’s investment strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is at this stage where the concept of trade operations comes into play. In
    the retail world, an investor would simply establish a brokerage account at a
    crypto exchange, fund the account, pick which cryptocurrencies they would like
    to invest in, and then allocate their capital accordingly. A crypto-asset manager
    effectively does the same thing in a more formalized way. Compared to a retail
    crypto investor, the crypto fund manager also generally deploys capital, utilizes
    more crypto exchange partners and works with more service providers to support
    the trading process.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before a crypto fund actually purchases a cryptocurrency, there is generally
    a ***pre-trade process*** that it follows. The first step in this process would
    be for the crypto fund’s investment strategy to be utilized to construct a list
    of cryptocurrencies that the fund is allowed to invest in to form what is known
    as an ***investible universe*** or ***investment universe***. This list could
    be a definitive list of cryptocurrencies or instead a general list of desired
    characteristics of cryptocurrencies that would be eligible to be part of the investible
    universe. An example of the latter would be large market cap cryptocurrencies
    with an operating history of over five years and offered on at least four exchanges
    for trading. Based on this example, a number of coins would be excluded from this
    particular fund’s investment universe and therefore, the crypto fund would not
    be able to invest in them without revising its guidelines or making a documented
    trading exception.

- en: Once the investible universe has been defined the next step would be for the
    crypto fund’s investment personnel, such as a Chief Investment Officer (CIO) or
    an investment analyst, to decide what cryptocurrencies they would actually like
    to trade at a particular point in time. This process of developing an investment
    thesis is commonly known as ***trade idea generation***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of trade idea generation would be an investment analyst that proposes
    that the crypto fund they work for should go long Bitcoin and short Ethereum when
    the correlation between the two drops below 0.90 during any time in the next three
    months. We don’t know if this will be a profitable strategy or not, but this is
    the strategy that is being proposed at this point based on factors such as the
    investment analyst's research and trading intuition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After a trade idea has been generated the person proposing the strategy typically
    documents the trading idea in what is known as an ***investment memorandum***.
    This memorandum is then typically circulated to senior investment personnel in
    the crypto fund for review. In many cases, a select group of these individuals,
    including the CIO, would then likely vote as to whether or not they would like
    to go ahead with this strategy. These groups of people are commonly referred to
    as an ***investment committee****.* Firms can employ different governance structures
    regarding the way these voting mechanisms work. For example, some crypto funds
    may follow a policy that all votes need to be unanimous in favor of proceeding
    with the investment strategy otherwise it is not approved. Others may follow a
    policy that a majority is only required instead of unanimity. When this is the
    case, typically the CIO must be one of the individuals voting in favor of proceeding
    with the strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming that the investment committee approves the proposal, then a ***trading
    strategy*** must be developed. A trading strategy is different than trade idea
    generation in that a trading strategy focuses on the most successful way for the
    fund manager to execute their trades. There are many different measures of success
    in trading depending on the priorities of the firm. For example, if a crypt fund
    is purchasing a position for the first time, known as ***initiating a position***,
    in a newly launched highly desirable low market cap cryptocurrency, then the measure
    of success for the crypto-asset manager in this instance may be merely making
    a purchase of the cryptocurrency in question. In other instances, for a highly
    liquid cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, the measure of trading success
    may be the speed at which the trades are executed in order to reduce what is known
    as ***slippage***, the difference between the desired price versus the price at
    which the trade actually occurred. Another consideration could be the cost of
    executing the trades and whether or not measures were taken to minimize costs
    or instead work with brokers who may charge higher fees but may provide additional
    value-added services such as investment research. In practice, many investment
    firms maintain a committee known as the best execution committee, to review the
    success of the trading strategies being employed by the funds. This review process
    can include utilizing a scoring system for different exchanges and brokers and
    then utilizing these scores going forward to determine which brokers the funds
    will show preference to when executing future trades.

    the details of proposed trades in a database such as Microsoft Excel. While straightforward
    and very cost-effective, these types of systems present a great deal of operational
    risk to the crypto fund in large part due to their highly manual nature. Other
    more sophisticated, and generally larger, crypto funds employ complex proprietary
    trading systems they developed themselves or they purchase third-party trading
    systems commonly referred to as order management systems (OMS) to capture trade
    information. By loading the information into the pre-trade blotter, often the
    OMS will have built in a number of operational checks to ensure that the fund’s
    systems are accurately set up in order to handle the proposed trade.

    new cryptocurrencies that are within the investible universe but that have not
    been set up in the firm’s trading systems. There are often a series of steps that
    must be undertaken from an operational perspective in order to properly set up
    the new cryptocurrency. If the OMS is not able to process the trade, the pre-trade
    operations checks would typically produce an alert to the trader and senior operational
    professionals, such as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and then the situation
    could be further investigated or rectified. Additionally, it should be noted that
    the OMS may also facilitate the use of pre-trade compliance checks. For reference
    these are discussed in more detail in Chapter [4](513667_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml).

    to be executed. This ***trade execution process*** involves the crypto fund manager
    purchasing or selling a cryptocurrency, or related crypto security such as a derivative.
    The entity on the other side of the trade is known as a ***trading counterparty***
    or ***counterparty***. It is common for a crypto fund manager to coordinate trading
    through an exchange. The date a trade is executed is referred to as the ***trade
    date***. After a crypto trade has been executed it must then go through a process
    known as ***trade confirmation***. As the name implies, the trade confirmation
    process involves the fund receiving confirmation that both the trade was executed.
    Crypto exchanges work with crypto-asset managers to facilitate the purchase and
    sale of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets in a variety of ways.

    be via both on-chain and off-chain transaction. ***On-chain transactions***, also
    simply referred to as a ***blockchain transaction***, are trades or transactions
    that actually occur on the blockchain themselves. In order for the transactions
    to be executed and considered validated then they need to be confirmed by miners,
    and then the public ledger would be subsequently updated with evidence of the
    transaction. Another method is known as an ***off-chain transaction***. These
    trades or transactions do not happen on the blockchain but instead outside of
    it. In practice there is often an interaction of the on-chain and off-chain models,
    and exchanges may be involved in facilitating that interaction.

- en: To understand the interaction between off-chain and on-chain transactions we
    can utilize the example of the decentralized crypto exchanges. Decentralized exchanges
    are often abbreviated as ***DEXs***. These decentralized exchanges receive buy
    and sell orders from investors. These orders are typically organized by counterparty
    into an ***order book model***. Order books can exist in a variety of formats
    including on-chain and off-chain. Other DEXs utilize a ***reserve-based model***
    where the exchange maintains a reserve to fulfil the supply and demand of different
    tokens that is created by on-chain smart contracts that also implement the trade
    execution and subsequent trade settlement procedures.[¹](#FPar1) Buy and sell
    orders are then executed directly from the ***token reserve***, as opposed to
    from a counterparty under the order book model.

- en: It should be noted that a crypto fund manager may trade directly with another
    counterparty, in what is known as an ***off-exchange trade***. When these types
    of trades take place, it is often common for a broker, commonly referred to as
    a ***clearing broker***, to assist in facilitating the transaction. The use of
    a broker that effectively sits between the two parties, as opposed to having the
    two parties trade directly with each other, can help to reduce counterparty risk
    in the overall transaction in a number of ways. An example of this would be if
    the broker holds the cryptocurrencies and fiat in escrow for each counterparty.
    Another example would be if the broker facilitates trade settlement as well as
    protecting the identities of the counterparties from each other if so desired.
    Other services that can be performed by brokers in off-exchange trades can include
    facilitating any pre- and post-trade compliance checks in areas such as anti-money
    laundering (AML).

    are exchanged between trading counterparties. In the traditional finance world,
    securities such as equities do not settle instantly but instead the settlement
    date occurs after the trade date. For equity trades in particular the common settlement
    period is three business days after the trade date. The common convention for
    writing this is to say that equity trades settle on a T+3 basis, where “T” is
    used to denote the trade date.

    known as ***trade reconciliation***. This process refers to the operational procedures
    by which a crypto-asset manager, or their designated service provider, compares
    the specific detail of a trade with other parties to the trading. The goal of
    this is to ensure that all parties to the crypto trade maintain the same details
    of the trade. Therefore, while trade settlement compares the trade details on
    a pre-trade basis, the trade reconciliation compares trade details on a post-trade
    basis. These pre- and post-trade checks are important because discrepancies can
    lead to the incorrect amount of money and crypto securities being transferred
    among the parties to a trade. These types of errors could have further detrimental
    cascading events in the areas including fund valuation, risk management and fund
    reporting.

    of reconciliation referred to as a ***two-way crypto reconciliation***. The two
    parties involved in a two-way reconciliation are the crypto fund and the crypto
    exchange. A more intricate reconciliation is known as a ***three-way crypto reconciliation***.
    A three-way reconciliation builds upon a two-way reconciliation to add a third
    party, the other trading counterparty to the reconciliation process. This is sometimes
    referred to as a ***triangular crypto reconciliation*** process. A common service
    provider that facilitates the fund accounting and operations as part of the trade
    settlement and reconciliation processes is a fund administrator.

    category relates to fund account activities. The second category relates to shareholder
    services.
  prefs: []

    to not engage a third-party administrator. In this instance the services typically
    performed by an administrator would be performed in-house. When a fund does this,
    it is known a ***self-administration***. The second option would be to engage
    a third-party administrator for your fund. This is known as ***outsourced administration***.
    It is considered best practice to follow an outsourced administration model. A
    key reason for this is because a third-party administrator is viewed by most fund
    investors as providing an additional degree of third-party oversight to the funds.
    Additionally, as a crypto fund manager, you may not have the requisite experience
    or time to devote to performing the traditional tasks performed by an administrator.

    process related to managing investor inflows and outflows of capital into and
    out of the funds. This subscription and redemption process includes not only accounting
    for the actual cash movements associated with investors but also the associated
    compliance checks for example in the areas of anti-money laundering. For reference
    anti-money laundering is discussed in more detail in Chapter [5](513667_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to compliance checks, as part of the subscription and redemption
    work of a fund administration, they should also perform checks related to compliance
    with fund terms such as lock-up periods. Some crypto funds opt for no redemptions
    to be processed during the lock-up period. This is known as a ***hard lock-up***.
    Other crypto funds may instead choose to allow redemptions during an investor’s
    lock-up period subject to a penalty. This is known as a ***soft lock-up***. The
    purpose of the penalty is to discourage investors from redeeming during the soft
    lock-up period while still providing them with the flexibility to redeem their
    capital if necessary. If a redemption is permitted during a soft lock-up period,
    then the administrator would calculate and apply the appropriate penalty fees.
  prefs: []

    are processed on a permissible date as outlined in the fund documentation. This
    is typically at the beginning of a month or quarter. Further related to redemptions,
    the administrator should also check to ensure that investors have complied with
    the guidelines outlined in your crypto fund’s offering documentation such as the
    provision of a ***redemption notice period***. These are the number of days, usually
    counted as business days, in advance that an investor must indicate prior to being
    eligible to receive a redemption of their capital back. Typically, redemption
    notice periods are in the range of 90 to 120 business days.

    is the providing of statements to investors showing their account balance in the

    about the crypto fund’s portfolio holdings, fund performance and risk information.
    Investor reporting will also typically include assistance with fund-related tax
    reporting relevant for investors such as the preparation of tax forms such as
    Schedule K-1\. Most modern administrators offer investor reporting through online
    Web-based portals. Prior to engaging the administrator, you should evaluate these
    portals and the various reporting packages that are available off-the-shelf as
    well as potential customized reporting options.

    the services offered by the overall administration firm but also the quality of
    the specific staff that will be servicing your account. Typically, many fund administrators
    maintain separate locations for their fund accounting and shareholder services
    team. You should interview these individuals to ensure they have the appropriate
    experience in the crypto space. Additionally, you should inquire as to how many
    other fund managers they will be servicing at the same time to ensure there is
    adequate capacity on the fund administration teams to service your account.

    charge variable flat monthly fees that scale up based on assets under management
    (AUM). Beyond a certain asset level, the flat fees convert to a basis points (bps)
    fee based on fund AUM. For reference 1 basis point is equal to 0.0001 or 1/100th
    of a percent. An example of this type of flat dollar based fee schedule is in

    8 bps a month on $1 million of your crypto fund’s assets at launch. Therefore,
    8bps on $10 million would be a fee of $800 per month for the administrator. In
    practice, however, many administrators require a minimum fee to be met on a monthly
    basis that may exceed the purely calculated basis points fee (i.e., the $800 in
    our example). For example, if the administrator required $2,000 per month as the
    minimum fee, then the monthly administration fee for your crypto fund at launch
    would be $2,000 not the $800, we had previously calculated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As assets under management for your fund rose the calculated basis point fee
    would continue to rise. Continuing our example at $30 million of assets under
    management the calculated 8bps administration fee would be $24,000 per month which
    would meet the minimum fee required by the administrator. With this minimum met,
    above $30 million the new higher fee (i.e., above the $3,000 minimum) would be
    applied. These fees do not scale uniformly in perpetuity. Instead, most fund administrators
    typically employ a reduced basis points fee as fund’s assets under management
    increase beyond certain predetermined levels. This is known as a **sliding scale
    fee model**.

    of the fund manager, there is a potential conflict of interest inherent in the
    fund administration relationship. Specifically, the administration fees for your
    crypto fund are fund expenses that are ultimately paid for by capital provided
    by investors in the fund. Despite the fact that investors are the ones effectively
    paying for the administrator, the administrator often defers to the fund manager
    and not investors in most instances.[³](#FPar1) Although this structure is very

    will need to undertake that can take up to two months or more to complete before
    a crypto fund is brought fully onboard with a bank. The first reason this process
    can take several months is because correct or not, crypto funds are viewed as
    being inherently riskier from the banker's perspective. Due to the perceived riskiness
    of the crypto space combined with the illicit ways in which criminals have utilized
    crypto on the dark web and through well-publicized dark net markets such as Silk

    experience in this space. This will be an important consideration for all the
    service providers we will discuss. The crypto space presents a number of unique
    risk management, operations and legal and compliance challenges that service providers

    one relationship and therefore, use the sum of the cash across all these accounts
    to determine if you have met the minimum requirements. Other banks may take a
    more segregated approach and view the different bank accounts as being subjected

    would require the crypto fund to maintain a set amount of cash, such as $50,000,
    in the account at all times. This would be a requirement to maintain the account
    in good standing. If the cash balance in the crypto fund account went below $50,000
    then the bank may have the right to terminate the account or subject the fund’s
    bank account to additional substantial fees. Other banks may apply an average
    monthly balance rule. Under this methodology, the average of cash throughout the
    month in an account must exceed a certain threshold. This means that throughout
    the month the balance can go above and below a certain amount, such as $50,000
    figure, as long as on average the balance is above the $50,000 figure.

    cash in and out of the accounts once they are up and running. These ***wire transfer
    fees*** are typically charged on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Domestic
    cash wires are usually cheaper than international cash wires. Additionally, incoming
    wire fees are usually less than outgoing wire fees. In general wire fees for each

    is one-hundredth of a percent, and is often abbreviated as, “bps.” The impact
    of the FDIC assessment is often viewed in conjunction with the earnings credit
    for the crypto fund and management company bank accounts. Specifically, the earnings
    credit is the soft dollar credit applied against monthly fees. Additionally, both
    the earnings credit and FDIC assessment are typically based on average collected
    balances each month. For example, let us consider if the earnings credit rate

    is the method used by the custodian to hold the asset of the crypto fund. Historically,
    in the world of traditional finance, some custodians would hold fund assets in
    the name of their own custodian firm. This is referred to as a ***non-segregated
    custodial relationship*** because the assets of the crypto fud manager are not
    segregated from the assets of the custodian, This type of relationship potentially
    exposes the assets held by the custodian to a larger degree of counterparty risk.
    The reason for this is because if the custodian should then itself fail, then
    as part of the insolvency procedures the fund’s assets could be repossessed and
    taken away to pay the custodians debtors. This type of situation would result
    in the crypto fund’s assets being effectively unrecoverable. To avoid these types
    of problems, and minimize unnecessary counterparty exposure, it is generally therefore
    considered to be a preferable option for a custodian to not hold in the name of
    the custodian, but rather in the name of the fund itself. This type of arrangement
    is referred to as a ***segregated custodial relationship*** because the crypto

    to select to service your crypto fund and management company, the next stage is
    to actually hire them. As we outlined above with regard to the fund administrator,
    as part of this process you will need to enter into a contract with the firms.
    This contract can come in different forms depending on the service provider in
    question. For example, a law firm will not typically provide you with a detailed
    contract per se but rather an engagement letter that outlines the various services
    that will be provided to support the fund launch and the associated hourly fees
    for ongoing and additional work. Other vendors such as the fund administrator
    will typically provide a more traditional long-form contract.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and disclaimers, the other document you will typically be asked to sign is something
    known as a service level agreement (SLA). Similar to the engagement letter from
    a law firm discussed above, the purpose of the SLA is to describe in more straightforward
    language the scope of services that a vendor will provide for your crypto fund.
    To illustrate the difference between the contract and SLA let us consider a description
    of the monthly reconciliation services that could be provided by a fund administrator.
    The contract may describe the services as follows, “The Fund Administrator (or
    ‘Administrator’) will provide services in their discretion including but not limited
    to the preparation of reconciliation and related services in a frequency as mutually
    agreed upon between the crypto manager and the Administrator.” While technically
    accurate from a legal perspective this is not necessarily clear to non-legal personnel
    or specific enough to really understand how frequently the fund administrator
    may be performing reconciliations. The SLA on the other hand could describe the
    services as follows, “The Fund Administrator will perform monthly reconciliation
    service for the crypto fund.” This is much more straightforward and understandable.
    To be clear there is nothing wrong with the more technical legal language contained
    in the contract, however, it serves a different purpose than the more straightforward
    SLA.

    and fees. You should shop around and potentially attempt to negotiate for lower
    fees or more advantageous terms for your crypto firm. The worst that can happen
    is that the vendor will reject your proposal, but if you don’t at least attempt
    to negotiate then you will have no opportunity to gain more in the deal. This
    is not to say you should over negotiate or simply pick the lowest priced vendor,
    but the point to remember is ultimately the vendor is competing for your business
    and therefore, you should ensure they are incentivized to make their pricing and
    services levels competitive with the rest of the marketplace.

- en: This chapter provided an introduction to the subject of operations for crypto-asset
    managers. It began with an overview with considerations for a crypto-asset manager
    developing operating policies and procedures. As part of this conversation, we
    discussed the process of creating an operations manual as well as the common topics
    covered in these manuals. This included a discussion of trade operations and controls
    ranging from pre-trade operational procedures through to specific trade implementation
    for cryptocurrencies and trade settlement. We next discussed operational considerations
    for crypto trading exchanges. As part of this discussion, we covered on-chain
    versus off-chain transactions and covered a decentralized exchange example. Other
    topics in this chapter included the onboarding process and operational roles of
    the fund administrator, bank and custodian. Now that we have established a fundamental
    understanding of crypto fund operations, in the next chapter we will expand our
    discussion to include compliance and governance considerations for crypto-asset
    managers.
