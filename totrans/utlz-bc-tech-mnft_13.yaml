    solutions used by industrial firms to improve customer satisfaction and to assess
    their effect. This study seeks to discover and suggest new connections between
    logistics management solution theory and customer satisfaction using semi-structured
    interviews. Twelve small and mid-sized Algerian industrial firms from various
    industries participated in the semi-structured interviews. Their 22 top supply
    chain and logistics managers were questioned to determine their perceptions of
    what is essential to their suppliers and how logistics management is crucial for
    them to be happy customers. In today's highly competitive global economy, businesses
    are under increasing pressure to discover innovative methods to generate value
    and deliver it to their consumers.

- en: Nearly 25 years ago, consumer satisfaction with customer service was the focus
    of business research. Business consultants, companies, and operational management
    have worked together to identify the characteristics of companies that consistently
    delight their customers, develop techniques for measuring customer satisfaction,
    and implement continuous quality improvement mechanisms that respond to customer
    feedback. Customer service and satisfaction are essential for every firm looking
    to evaluate its performance and guarantee its survival, regardless of whether
    the study was performed by and for the business sector. Product prices gradually
    increased throughout the 1950s and 1960s, resulting in many crises and restricted
    buying power. Business consultants were looking for a solution that balanced customer
    happiness, cost, and quality. Furthermore, the fierce competition at the period
    pushed businesses to seek a competitive edge. According to the study, logistics
    management may help a company achieve customer satisfaction, cost, and value advantage.

    supply, and third-party logistics service provider administration are all examples
    of logistics management. Customer service, sourcing, procurement, production planning,
    scheduling, packing, and assembly are all examples of logistics management. Logistics
    management is an important part of strategic, operational, tactical, and operational
    planning and execution at all levels (Achumba.,et.al,2013). In today''s competitive
    market, businesses must run at peak efficiency and provide great service to be
    profitable. In the fast moving consumer products sector, three variables have
    been discovered to influence warehouse efficiency and effectiveness: warehouse
    management system simplicity/complexity, product slotting methods, and warehouse
    layout design. The capacity of the company to efficiently manage the warehouse,
    minimise costs, and fulfil orders is crucial to its success. It is important to
    note that warehouse management presents significant difficulties for businesses.
    Because of changes in the way raw materials, intermediate commodities, and final
    products are handled, the function and significance of warehouses in the American
    economy has shifted significantly(Albernaz.,et.al, 2014). Warehouse management
    is becoming more generally recognized as a necessity in today''s market, where
    customer satisfaction and service have become a crucial element in a company''s
    capacity to stand out from the competitors. To ensure optimal performance throughout
    the business, the warehouse operating system must be built for receiving inventory,
    fast order fulfilment, automated validation of warehouse operations, and accurate
    inventory management.'

- en: The success of physical product distribution relies heavily on the warehousing
    network. Leading companies are seen to use and execute various warehousing techniques,
    including as capacity switching, hub networking, cobbling, and outsourcing. For
    enhancing warehouse design techniques, both analytic and simulation models are
    suggested. Analytic models are often design-oriented, which means they look at
    a lot of different options rapidly to find a solution. Simulation models, on the
    other hand, are often analysis-oriented. They can offer an opinion on a design,
    but they are generally restricted in their capacity to explore the design area.
    To gain more flexibility in evaluating warehouse issues, both methods must be
    integrated. Aside from new supply chain trends, technological advancements have
    a significant effect on storage. Many formerly manual activities have now been
    mechanised or even automated. Robots may be employed to arrange arriving goods
    on pallets in an automated warehouse (Dobler Burt.,et.al,2006). Each pallet's
    contents are transmitted to a central computer, which allocates the pallet to
    a vacant storage space. Incoming pallets are transported to the storage buffer
    by conveyors or guided vehicles, and pallets are stored in the correct location
    in the storage area by automated Storage/Retrieval equipment.

    efficient, effective, forward, reverse flow, goods, services, related information
    of origin, and point of consumption in order to meet customer requirements, according
    to the Council of Logistics Management. In layman's terms, having the right product
    in the right location at the right time in the right condition means having the
    right thing in the right place at the right time in the right condition. On the
    other side, the supply chain includes all of the processes involved in fulfilling
    a customer's request. It starts with the supplier and extends to production, distribution,
    retail, and, finally, the customer (Kandampully.J.,et.al, 2003). Supply chain
    management is the management of goods, information, and money as they move through
    the supply chain from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to customer.
    Developing new technologies, businesses may gain strategic competitive advantages
    in a variety of management activities, such as logistics and supply chain management.
    The application's degree of success, on the other hand, is determined by the technology
    it employs, as well as the presence of appropriate organisational infrastructure,
    culture, and management practises. In the logistics sector, information, communication,
    and automation technologies have dramatically improved the speed with which data
    is recognised, collected, processed, analysed, and sent while maintaining a high
    degree of accuracy and dependability. Technology can help businesses improve their
    competitiveness and performance. It makes a major contribution to supply chain
    performance by enhancing the logistics system's overall performance and efficiency.
    Many modern technologies are utilised in logistics in industrialised countries,
    but acceptance in India is sluggish. As the Indian economy liberalises, competition
    is intensifying, and the only way to stay ahead of the pack is to invest in technology-enabled
    processes (C.R. Kothari et al., 2008).

    rivalry. As a consequence of the rapid rate of change in global markets, many
    manufacturing companies have been pushed to become more responsive to changing
    customer expectations and needs for more value-added products and services(Chepkoeh.A,et.al,2019).
    The most important approach for manufacturing companies to succeed in today's
    competitive market is to offer value-added, high-quality, and creative products.
    To remain competitive, many Malaysian industrial firms have implemented a variety
    of improvement initiatives and established new operational philosophies (Cooper.D.R,
    et.al,2015). Since the 1980s, SCM has gradually grown in popularity in manufacturing
    firms and has become an essential component of company strategy.

    network is becoming more dynamic. This digitization provides simple access to
    consumer requirements by efficiently sharing product/service delivery tracking
    information. The tracking information is guaranteed by the integration of businesses
    involved in the supply chain process, whose job it is to create mapping between
    different systems. The integration of data or information across different companies
    usually resulted in high expenses and sluggish dissemination. This study looks
    at how blockchain technology may be used to integrate supply chains. This technology
    works by integrating with the cloud, which provides a cost-effective business
    strategy for digital supply chains. Furthermore, via increased visibility, this
    technology may aid in the disruption of digital supply chain networks. Continuous
    monitoring is possible with such visibility, resulting in better supply chain
    performance. Due to the inherent dangers, adoption of this technology in the logistics
    and supply chain sector is sluggish, and some businesses are cautious about its
    deployment. However, it is anticipated that blockchain will gain the required
    trust and extend its acceptance across all industries.

    block-chain in the construction industry, particularly in local and international
    logistics and sales. This technology also benefits construction projects in terms
    of openness and visibility throughout the whole value chain. Blockchain technology
    is made up of three components: private key cryptography, a peer-to-peer network,

    that any of the blockchain's members can write and read into it. A read-write-controlled
    database, such as Bitcoin, is one example. Traditional database systems provide
    less confidentiality and trust than blockchain databases. Blockchain requires
    a significant amount of encryption in order to preserve information secrecy. The
    architecture, or how related technologies are integrated with one another, is
    the primary distinction between a blockchain and a conventional database. A client-server
    network architecture is used to operate a conventional database system. A client
    may update records in a database that is kept on a centralized server if they
    have the appropriate rights. The administrator is in charge of such a centralized
    database system, and authorization to access the database is needed. The blockchain
    database, on the other hand, is a decentralised database in which each member
    maintains, calculates, and updates new entries. It enables members to share information
    without the need for a central administrator.

    all over the world. Many Malaysian manufacturing firms have implemented SCM to
    reduce waste and errors, improve corporate performance, and maintain or improve
    overall firm performance as a result of the changing global business environment.
    SCM is gaining popularity because it is seen as a strong motivator and strategic
    tool for companies looking to succeed in the marketplace. As a result, academics
    are beginning to see SCM as having the potential to aid in performance improvement.
    The availability of appropriate quality and quantity raw materials will have a
    major effect on the final product's availability, quality, and quantity. Raw material
    management is critical to a manufacturing company's overall success is shown in
    Figure 1\. Aside from demand and other factors such as competitor activities and
    the general price index, the raw material condition in terms of efficient management
    and good planning has an impact on a business's level of activity, turn-over,
    and final profit. In every production process, determining the economic, reorder

    of adhering to the principles of balanced raw material management. Material management,
    which is defined as the coordination of activities in a manufacturing organization
    in order to enhance Procurement, transportation, stocking, and usage of inputs
    efficiency is therefore essential to production operations and management. Material
    management's effectiveness and efficiency have a direct impact on the organization's
    overall success. In order to accomplish continuous production cycles and improved
    operational efficiency, raw material management in a manufacturing company requires
    special attention and scrutiny. Maintaining a sufficient stock level may also
    free up operational capital that might be put to better use elsewhere.

    of boards and other materials. The terms used in the explanation of the key task
    primary distribution centre are “stockroom and focus dispersion,” which are mutual,
    controlled, and effective. In an interims chain structure, warehousing and setup
    are two completely distinct portions with equal capability. Warehousing is the
    storage of products, inventories, information, and other items in a specified
    area or structure. The products are redesigned and repackaged at a warehouse.
    On a larger size, this item will mainly seem bundled, but on a smaller scale,
    it will appear unbundled. In other words, one of the most essential things that
    this distribution centre can accomplish is to prevent the under bump goliath manufactured
    goods from spreading too far. The downstream distribution centre operations are
    usually more focused in these sectors. When the object is treated as a landscape,
    it becomes even more unique. After all, the less time you spend dealing with the
    unit, the more handling costs you'll have to pay. Although the distribution centre
    will serve a broad variety of closures, the most of them will have the same flow
    texture. To put it another way, they receive a big cargo, put it on fast healing,
    recover and sort SKUs, distribute them to consumers, and maintain the supply chain.

    sector, which continues to be one of the most underutilized areas in the country.
    While the distribution centre market is inefficient in its oversight, it may cause
    major disruptions across the manufacturing network. The ability to associate with
    areas in India is no longer particularly reassuring, as it has resulted in substantial
    losses in the item's transportation, dispersion, and capacity. Given India's significant
    development in organized retail and producing activities, market testimonies are

    management, and even rhocrematics have all been utilised. Regardless of its name,
    business logistics is an important part of management in most companies, whether
    they are manufacturing or service-oriented. The process of planning, executing,
    controlling, efficient, cost-effective, raw materials, stocks, products, and related
    information from point of origin to meet customer needs, as defined by the Council
    of Logistics Management. The global economy is becoming more linked than ever
    before. Companies are pursuing, or have already implemented, global strategies
    in which their goods are intended for a worldwide market and manufactured wherever
    low-cost raw materials, components, and labour are available, or they produce
    locally and sell globally. Supply and distribution lines are stretched in both
    instances as compared to a company that wants to produce and sell locally. Not
    only did the trend emerge naturally as a consequence of businesses seeking to
    save costs or expand their markets, but it was also helped by trade-friendly government
    frameworks. As businesses adopt a more global perspective of their operations,
    logistics performance and costs will play a larger role in globalization/internationalization.
    Since a result, logistics becomes more important inside the company, as logistics
    expenses, particularly transportation costs, account for a substantial portion
    of overall costs. If a business wishes to locate foreign suppliers for its resources
    or produce its products in other countries, for example, the goal is to earn more
    money. Although material and labour costs may be cheaper, if transportation and
    inventory costs increase, logistics costs are likely to rise as well. Shows a
    compromise that may result in a greater profit by cutting material, labour, and
    administrative costs but sacrificing logistics and tariffs. Outsourcing improves
    the supply chain's value, but it requires tighter logistics cost control to product

    them in UDDI Registries so that other businesses can discover and utilize them.
    The ideas contained in ELPIF may be extended to various domains, even though we
    are focused on the shipping sector.Shipping services would be able to follow a
    paradigm of what might be termed a generic shipping service by integrating Web
    Services with a common interface approach. This is important because it enables
    a shipping service client to create code that uses the generic shipping model
    and then use the dynamic data binding method to access a particular shipping service
    implementation at run time. Developers do not need to alter their development
    environments to create or utilize Web Services since they can be implemented in
    any programming language. As a result, the architectural flexibility of our framework
    may benefit any client application. XML enables the transmission of business data
    across businesses in most integration systems by offering a cross-platform solution
    to data encoding and data formatting. SOAP, for example, is based on XML and provides
    a straightforward method to package data for transmission between systems. UDDI
    enable programmable components to be put on remote-accessible Web sites. We can
    not only offer interoperability for our clients, but we can also utilize our multi-platform
    approach to create superior products and solutions that enable any industry to
    conduct transactions quickly and effectively by using the aforementioned technologies.

    a result, fast food outlets, particularly McDonald's, were chosen as sample units.
    The number of answers obtained throughout the research was more than anticipated,

    as if there is evidence that employing a third-party logistics company is cost-effective.
    Finally, we offer suggestions to assist in the selection and hiring of a third-party
    logistics provider for the manufacturing sector. A self-administered questionnaire
    was utilised to gather the information. The supply chain operations reference
    was used to evaluate this (SCOR). In terms of lowering order management costs,

    causing consumers to put more expectations on producers to improve quality, serviceability,
    and flexibility while keeping prices low. Improving logistics performance was
    one method to increase efficiency in manufacturing companies. As a result, if
    manufacturing companies wanted to improve their efficiency and flexibility, they
    needed new methods to manage product flow from the manufacturing site to the end
    customer.

    today's companies. Logistics management reduces overall operating expenses and
    improves the effectiveness of a company's commercial activities. Reduced lead
    times afforded by seamless material flow from the upstream to the downstream end
    of the supply chain may enhance organizational competitiveness when coupled with
    a responsive strategy. This strategy will guarantee that end consumers receive
    good value for their money while also reducing industry uncertainty. Many reasons
    led to the growth of logistics management in the form we know it today, including
    deregulation, competitive forces, information technology, globalisation, and profit
    leverage. The goal of logistics management was to increase the number, size, and
    placement of factories and warehouses while controlling distribution costs is
    shown in Figure.2.. As a result, Logistics management has excelled in inventory
    control and transportation, as well as in the operational side of Logistics.

    methods. Supply chain management and logistics have long been seen as critical
    components of a company's ability to compete. Logistics and supply chain management
    have received a lot of attention since the early 1980s. On the other hand, supply
    chain management is a difficult topic to grasp, and many writers have emphasized
    the need of precise definitional structures and conceptual frameworks in this
    area. We provide a lesson on current research in logistics and supply chain operations
    management in this article. This page begins with an explanation of the terms
    logistics and supply chain management, which will aid you in comprehending the
    breadth of the research articles that follow. The main aim of this website is
    to demonstrate how these studies contribute from various research perspectives
    and to address a range of current problems in this area. Finally, we discuss our
    findings as well as future study possibilities in this area.

- en: The management of product transit between the point of origin and the site of
    consumption in order to satisfy specific needs, such as those of consumers or
    companies, is referred to as logistics. Food, liquids, and abstract notions like
    time, information, particles, and energy are all part of logistics. Information
    transfer, material handling, manufacturing, packing, inventory, shipping, storage,
    and, in certain cases, security are all part of the logistics of physical things.
    Dedicated simulation tools may be used to simulate, analyse, visualise, and optimise
    logistics complexity. Import and export logistics are driven by the desire to
    utilise as little resources as feasible. Despite the fact that the preceding definition
    of logistics is not universal, it is likely to be accepted in this case. The Council
    of Logistics Management, now known as the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals,
    defines inventory management as the process of planning, implementing, controlling,
    and ensuring an efficient and effective flow of goods, services, and information
    from point of origin in order to meet customer requirements.

    flow. It is also emphasized the significance of product storage, transportation,
    distribution, packaging, and processing. Despite the fact that corporate logistics
    covers a broad variety of operations, traditional logistics research has mostly
    concentrated on logistics infrastructure, transportation, and inventory planning.
    The term supply chain management seems to be even less defined than logistics.
    According to the authors, SCM has been poorly defined, and “there is a considerable
    degree of variation in people's views. Nonetheless, we provide a generally accepted
    definition that is very broad, not limited to any one academic field, and properly
    reflects the vast range of problems that this term is often used to address. Supply
    chain management is defined as the systematic, strategic coordination of traditional
    business operations and strategies inside a firm and across businesses in the
    supply chain with the goal of improving the individual company's and supply chain's
    long-term performance.

- en: The words logistics and supply chain are frequently used interchangeably in
    academics and business because they are intimately related to product circulation
    over its whole life cycle, and both have been considered as the fundamental unit
    of competitive analysis in model management science. The phrase “supply chain”
    refers to a broader notion that encompasses, among other things, network sourcing,
    supply pipeline management, value chain management, and value stream management.
    Furthermore, since the supply chain is made up of a range of organisations, the
    majority of which are businesses, the idea of logistics has nothing to do with
    the concept of organisation, which is the polar opposite of supply chain. One
    of the most significant aspects of supply chain management is that businesses
    want to enhance the supply chain as a whole rather than cutting costs or increasing
    profits at the expense of their supply chain partners. As a result, one of the
    most fundamental supply chain management ideas is that supplier networks, not
    individual companies, compete. Game theory, like incentive theory, is an essential
    study technique for supply chain management in situations when information is
    lacking.

    guarantees efficient manufacturing, consistent delivery, and cost savings. Large
    variations in demand, on the one hand, and a strong need for balanced output,
    on the other, are common challenges for businesses. Flexible responses are often
    difficult due to rigid manufacturing planning. There aren't many stochastic techniques
    for optimizing sequencing. Lead times are lengthy, procedures are inefficient,
    and in-process inventories are large as a consequence of this. Some manufacturers
    may consider creating a corporate vision that maximizes operational excellence,
    offers insightful analytics, implements and measures strategic initiatives, and
    identifies and manages risks to assist their businesses transition to “ruthless
    competitor” status. To accomplish so, businesses should concentrate on consistent
    business processes and create well-defined and linked business, technological,
    and operational strategies that enhance flexibility and speed while also allowing
    them to profitably react to market changes.

    as well as overall cost management and performance assessment, should all be included
    in these efforts. In order for the company's overarching strategic vision to succeed,
    corporate leaders, business unit managers, programme managers, and operational
    employees must all support it. Master Production Scheduling (MPS) is the process
    of scheduling things across time that have a significant effect on lower-level
    components or have capacity needs. End items, intermediate components, or a pseudo
    item that depicts things gathered for the sake of planning are all examples of
    master planned items. Making a production plan requires a range of inputs, ranging
    from supply chain to operations to assembly line capacity planning. With this
    complexity comes a major divergence between the sales order input team and the
    production line orders, which are frequently accepted without evaluating acceptable
    lead times or dependencies, leaving manufacturing with a difficult task.

    expenses. Within and across businesses, the SCM synchronizes and amalgamates these
    flows. The primary responsibility of a The goal of a supply chain executive or
    manager is to reduce cycle time by managing the supply chain. The supply chain
    should be planned and implemented in such a manner that it coordinates the supply
    system. As a result, supply chain management is critical for collecting consumer
    needs, forecasting, establishing schedules, buying and managing inventories, regulating
    manufacturing orders, and optimizing customer satisfaction. Traditionally, the
    design of an MPS and the management of the SCM have been looked at independently,
    and each issue has been addressed without the outcomes being linked. This results
    in synchronisation issues, product loss and theft, delivery delays, poor inventory
    management, excessive transportation expenses, and other issues.

    with plant capacity, storage capacity, shipping capacity, and disaggregated demand
    at the retail level. Another essential guideline to follow in the MPS-SCM system
    is the customer service level. This idea is based on a number of distinct performance
    metrics. The order fill rate refers to the percentage of client requests that
    are fulfilled from stock. There is no need to consider supplier and production
    wait times for this small percentage of client orders. At every level of the system,
    the order fill rate may be assessed in terms of a central warehouse, a field warehouse,
    or stock. The stock out rate is the inverse of the fill rate, and it shows the
    number of orders that are lost due to a stock out. The number of backordered orders
    is the total number of orders that have not yet been fulfilled. To offer the greatest
    possible customer service, order fill rate, stock out rate, and backorder levels
    must all be optimized. Another measure is on-time delivery probability, which
    is defined as the proportion of customer orders completed on time, that is, before
    the agreed-upon date. Manufacturing Logistics is concerned with the opportunities
    and difficulties presented by a certain industry. These options allow for the
    deployment of a collection of critical resources to assist industrial processes,
    or they involve a series of critical logistical chores. The process of identifying
    customer end-item needs and fulfilling them starts with manufacturing logistics.
    The planning, scheduling, and management of all operations that result in inventory
    acquisition, processing, shipping, and storage is known as manufacturing logistics.
    Order acceptance, production planning and scheduling, inventory management, inventory
    distribution, and the creation of related decision procedures and decision support
    systems are among these tasks.

    human resources are all part of a hospitality unit, such as a restaurant, hotel,
    or amusement park. The supply chain is crucial in the hotel and catering sectors.
    In order to improve customer service, workers in this industry must develop excellent
    relationships with suppliers and work with a reliable ordering system. Spend intelligence

    logistics management is increasingly seen as an important component of a country's
    competitiveness. Customers' wants and expectations for products can only be met
    if goods and services are delivered on time and at a fair cost. Six logistics
    capabilities that may influence a company's performance are logistics information
    management, tight loop capability, supply chain integration, supply chain coordination,
    conformance capability, and institutional incentives. In today's economic environment,
    logistics management strategy is critical to an organization's entire corporate

    actors are required to make decisions that have a significant impact on the interests
    of other players. This term refers to circumstances in which the activities of
    a large number of participants are interdependent, whether they are people, organizations,
    companies, or a mix of all three. According to these specialists, there are two
    approaches to this Non-cooperative theory and cooperative theory is two types
    of theories. When the players may get a larger benefit by working together rather
    than alone, the former applies. Because transportation and customer happiness,
    which are variables in this research, need a high degree of global collaboration
    among all supply chain actors, this theory applies in this case. Collaboration
    is becoming increasingly important in order to enhance global logistics performance.
    They go on to say that a new collaboration model has shown to be effective in
    lowering worldwide costs and improving logistical service rates. This concept,
    especially the cooperative approach, is critical since a well-managed transportation
    system will almost definitely improve customer satisfaction by ensuring timely
    delivery of medical supplies. Because they handle the quantitative and qualitative
    mismatch between material availability and demand in production, marketing, and
    consuming, storage systems are important components of a logistics system. According
    to them, the main objectives of a logistics storage system are to organize a logical
    system of storage activities at minimum cost, to make effective use of all components,
    to identify and mobilize excess unneeded property, and to have timely and comprehensive
    inventory information. Monitoring material use is critical since it aids in the
    discovery of cost reductions and overruns.

    traffic or industrial processes to provide for temporary product storage and timely
    material resource delivery to industrial and commercial facilities in response
    to internal market requirements. They go on to say that there should be storage
    facilities between production and transportation, as well as between the times
    when products leave manufacturing units and reach consumers, to level out the
    erratic production, consumption, and operating cycles of different forms of transportation.
    As a consequence, the whole promotion of material flow from producers to consumers
    via the logistics chain must take into account the presence of a network of different
    storage systems. According to them, a warehouse is a complex technical structure
    that consists of many linked components, has a specified structure, and performs
    a range of activities in order to convert material flow, as well as the manufacturing
    and processing of consumer goods. As a consequence, rather than being thought
    of as a distinct entity, a warehouse should be considered an integral component
    of the supply chain.

    making common standards simpler to implement. Supply chain development will be
    the foundation of competitiveness in many sectors in the future age of hyper-competition,
    both implicitly and openly. As a consequence of supply chain analysis waste or
    duplicate activities, suppliers and logistics networks are urged to synchronies
    and minimize non-core operations. Regardless of the difficulties, developing a
    dependable and efficient supply chain may become a core skill, if not a differentiator,
    for any business. Supplier relationships and collaborations are critical in hotel
    logistics and supply chain management. Long-term cooperation benefits both the
    business and its suppliers by allowing them to profit from a direct, long-term
    connection while also encouraging collaborative problem-solving and planning.
    These strategic alliances allow hotels to work successfully with a select group
    of essential suppliers that are eager to share product success and cooperate to
    save time and effort. Client satisfaction rises as a result of relationships,
    and they are less likely to move on to the next hotel. As customer customization
    and personalized service have become more important, building relationships has
    become more important for company sustainability. Hotels may use the relationships
    to differentiate themselves from their competitors, keep customers loyal, and
    pass on value.
