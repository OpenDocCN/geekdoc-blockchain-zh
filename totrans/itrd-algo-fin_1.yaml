    economies. This industry relies extensively on mathematical modeling of underlying

- en: We choose the highly attractive field of option pricing, a core task of computational
    finance and risk analysis. An option is a contract that gives the holder the right,
    but not an obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a pre-agreed price, the strike
    price, on or before the date of expiry, the maturity date. The broad field of
    option pricing is quite ambitious and diverse enough to call for a wide range
    of computational tools. Confining mostly to option pricing enables us to have
    a more coherent and comprehensive textbook, to a large extent, and avoids being
    distracted away from computational issues. An option is a standard example of
    a derivative, a financial instrument whose value relies on one or more assets
    that are usually referred to as underlying assets. Generally, it takes the form
    of a contract to buy or sell an asset or item like commodity, property, etc. at
    the strike price, on or before the expiration date. Other examples of a derivative
    include bonds, futures contracts, forward contracts and swaps. (For detailed discussions
    see, among others, Jarrow and Turnbull, 2000.) The financial market in which derivatives
    are traded may be designated as the derivatives market. We assume a perfect market
    in the sense that there are no costs of transactions, no restrictions on short
    sales and existence of a common borrowing and lending rate. Short selling is a
    business tactic that involves borrowing an asset and selling it immediately, repurchasing
    the asset (hopefully at a lower price) and returning it to the lender to close
    the process. (Chapters 11 and 15 of this monograph provide further discussions
    along this line.)

- en: A derivatives market can be partitioned into two subgroups, one in which derivatives
    are traded in an organised exchange market where maintenance of market price and
    all transparencies are provided. An example of an exchange-traded derivative is
    an option. Under a futures contract, an exchange-traded agreement, the buyer is
    accountable to buy the underlying asset at a pre-arranged price at a future date.
    The seller makes the commitment to hand over the asset at the settled price and
    date. Another market-traded derivative is a bond, a debt security issued by government
    and corporate sectors to raise funds for various purposes including expansion
    of one or more sectors, infrastructural improvements and payment of existing debts.
    A financial market in which trading of bonds takes place is known as a bond or
    credit or debt market. A trading in the other market is of over-the-counter (OTC)
    type. This type of off exchange trading takes place directly between the traders
    without supervision of an exchange. An example of an OTC derivative is a forward
    contract under which two parties make an agreement to buy or sell an asset at
    a designated date on a promised price. A swap is an off exchange-traded derivative
    under which a financial instrument is exchanged between the parties concerned
    at a pre-specified time.

    be of various types such as asset risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk,
    credit risk, commodity risk and so on. While asset risk arises from volatility
    in asset prices, interest rate risk refers to the chance that variations in rate
    of interest may negatively affect an investment. Likewise, foreign exchange risk
    emerges from fluctuations in exchange rate between two different currencies. On
    the other hand, credit risk indicates the possibility of a lender's loss of principal
    and interest if a borrower fails to make committed payments. Commodity risk is
    related to the apprehension of loss that may arise because of oscillation in a
    commodity price in the future. But risks may also bring about unexpected benefit.
    Investors wish to make risky investments with the expectation of making profits
    in the future. Given that there can be alternative notions of risk, use of appropriate
    tools for the purpose of risk management becomes essential. Different forms of
    derivatives become useful in this situation. More precisely, derivatives are financial
    instruments for administering financial risks. They transfer different forms of
    financial risks to derivatives market. They are financial securities for hedging
    or bordering risks in the sense of protecting or at least reducing risks. The
    basic principle underlying asset pricing is the existence of non-arbitrage. According
    to an arbitrage opportunity, a trader can take advantage of price imbalance to
    extract rapid profit without any risk. Consequently, the non-arbitrage assumption
    means the rule of a single price. (Further discussions on arbitrage are available
    in Chapters 11 and 15 of this monograph.)

- en: Given that any investment in a risky asset includes the chance of a loss, it
    is quite likely that an investor will look into the problem of risk management
    in a portfolio, a composition of assets held by the investor. The investor often
    may be confronted with the necessity of ordering distributions of random returns
    on various financial assets or combinations of them on the basis of his preferences,
    represented by a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. This issue has been
    addressed in several pioneering contributions to the literature. A quite general
    approach to the resolution of the problem is the rule of stochastic dominance
    that enables us to order the distributions of random rates of return on assets
    for large classes of utility functions. No specific knowledge about the form of
    utility function is necessary. A concise illustrative introduction to the concept
    of stochastic dominance is presented in Chapter 7.

- en: In order to judge profitability of an investment, say, a firm's investment in
    a project, it becomes necessary to compare present values of cash inflows (benefits)
    and outflows (costs). The net present value (NPV) criterion that looks at the
    difference between present values of benefits and costs is a standard tool for
    this type of analysis. Alternatives to this are benefit–cost ratio and internal
    rate of return (IRR), a discount rate that makes NPV equal to zero. In this chapter,
    we present a brief discussion on these criteria. A brief discussion on bond as
    a particular type of constant earning security is also presented.

    = 0 and *t* = *T* represent, respectively, the current period and final period
    for which the investment affects benefits and costs. While *C* [0] indicates the
    size of the initial investment, for *t* ≥ 1, *C* [*t*] may be regarded as the
    maintenance cost. It is natural to assume that *C* [0] > 0 and *C* [*t*] ≥ 0 for
    *t* ≥ 1\. On the other hand, *B* [0] is likely to be 0, but from *t* = 1 onwards,
    *B* [*t*] s are non-negative. Then the discounted present value (DPV) of the inflows

    root whose value exceeds the discount rate may be used as IRR. In case there are
    mutually several exclusive projects, then the firm should choose the one that
    produces the highest IRR. When the discount rate varies over time, the use of
    the IRR criterion as an evaluation principle for selection of a project may not
    be feasible. Thus, while the concern of NPV is project surplus, IRR is concerned
    with break-even money flow. Of these two criteria, NPV is more popular as a project
    selection yardstick because it is easy to understand in terms of profitability
    of a project. (For further discussions, see Bierwag, 1987 and Damodaran, 2010.)

    The DPV of a consol comes to be ![inline-image](../images/CH002_7.jpg). Governments
    and corporate sectors issue bonds to borrow money with the objective of increasing
    liquid funds. Let *Q* be the face or principal value of a bond. It is the bond's
    price, par value; when the bond is first issued. This is the amount paid to the
    holder by the borrower on maturity of the bond. In exchange, the bond issuer is
    required to pay a fixed amount of money, say *A* dollars (the coupon) for a certain
    number of years, say *T*. At the terminal or maturity period *T*, the borrower
    returns the face value along with this period's coupon to the holder of the bond.

    the bond is at par. If *c* > *r*, then *Q* < *H*. In such a case the bond is known
    as a premium bond. Investors will pay a high price for a premium bond to get a
    higher coupon rate. Finally, the bond is referred to as a discount bond if *c*
    < *r*, so that the inequality *Q* > *H* holds. Lower coupon rate in this case
    is compensated by a lower or discounted bond price. So investors will pay for
    such a bond. (Further discussions on these issues are available in Damodaran,
    2010 and Chakravarty, 2013.)

    contract is an off exchange-traded obligatory contract between a buyer and a seller,
    to buy or sell an asset at a prearranged future time, at a prefixed delivery price;

    when the option expires in-the money, the buyer will exercise the right and buy
    the asset at the price *K* from the option seller although the asset's current
    market price is *S* [*t*] . This is as per the contract. If *S* [*T*] = *K* holds
    the option is said to expire at-the-money. In this case the trader is indifferent
    between exercising the right or not. Hence for *S* [*T*] ≥ *K*, the payoff associated
    with a long position in a European call option turns out to be (*S* [*T*] − *K*).
    On the other hand, when the option expires out-of-the-money, that is, when *S*
    [*T*] < *K* materializes, the payoff becomes zero, since the right is not exercised.

    gets validated. The buyer has to pay this fixed amount to the writer irrespective
    of whether the right is exercised or not. Hence it gets incorporated in the calculation

    right if the option expires in-the-money, that is, if *S* [*T*] < *K* holds. This

    holder has to supply the asset at the price *S* [*T*] to the writer which he can
    do after buying it from the market at *S* [*T*] . Since in exchange he receives
    *K*, his positive payoff from the deal becomes (*K* − *S* [*T*] ). The trader
    becomes indifferent between exercising the right or not if the put option expires
    at-the-money (*S* [*T*] = *K*). For the option expiring out-of-the money (*S*

    of a European call option indicates that if a trader expects a chance of a rise
    in the price of a stock over the strike price, it is highly likely that he will
    buy the right to purchase the stock at the strike price to exercise the right
    at the date of maturity. If at the date of expiration the strike price *K* exceeds
    the asset price *S* [*T*] , the individual will not exercise the right; the contract
    becomes worthless and the holder's loss is simply the premium ![inline-image](../images/CH003_16.jpg).
    Evidently, the same amount of loss arises if *K* = *S* [*T*] holds. If ![inline-image](../images/CH003_17.jpg)
    holds, that is, if the asset price is higher than the strike price but their difference
    is less than the contract fee, the trader should exercise the right because his
    loss is only a part of the contract fee. The right will certainly be exercised
    if ![inline-image](../images/CH003_18.jpg) holds. Likewise, when a trader foresees
    a possibility of a reduction in a stock price then he may be tempted to write
    a call option for a profitable deal. This gives a clear motivation for a trader
    to participate in a market for options. A second motivation can be explained using
    the definition of a European put option. We can deduce that if a trader presupposes
    that there can be a downturn in the price of an asset, he may be willing to purchase
    a put option to sell the asset for a profitable transaction. Analogously, if an
    asset price is anticipated to take an upturn, a trader can write a put option
    with the presumption of a beneficial execution. In other words, speculators who
    consciously take risks by gambling on future events can use options with the expectation
    of deriving benefits from changes in asset prices. If assets are priced inconsistently,
    arbitrageurs can use options to make riskless profits, since arbitrage is a trading
    strategy that takes advantage of inconsistent pricing. Finally, hedgers invest

- en: Investors may often require options for the purpose hedging, a strategy to reduce
    or evade risk. More precisely, hedging is a tool to guard the downturn of return
    from one investment by the upturn of return from another. In other words, hedging
    is a risk reduction/elimination strategy. Thus, a hedging involves at least two
    financial instruments that are highly negatively correlated. When it is possible
    to shield an investment or a portfolio, a dashboard of two or more investments,
    against all losses with the help of hedging, then we refer to the situation as
    perfect hedging. Hence, for perfect hedging a list of investments has to be combined
    in appropriate proportions so that the overall risk gets eliminated. The brief
    illustrational discussion presented in this section will enable us to understand
    the role of options as hedging strategies.

    a bullish price-spread strategy borders a trader's upward and downward risks.

- en: The binomial option valuation model is an extremely simple model for pricing
    of options. The model traces the evolution of the underlying asset price in discrete
    time units. The price of the underlying asset, instead of changing in a continuous
    manner, takes a leap to one of the two different new values, up and down, at the
    next time point. Consequently, the valuation of options relies on an iterative
    process, where for each iteration the only two possible outcomes are up and down.
    For each iteration, the model uses the same probabilities for up and down. The
    model is analytically simple and easy to understand. The simple structure of the
    model becomes helpful in administering the valuation of options under the possibility
    of early exercise.

    model of stock price evolution process stating the assumptions explicitly. The
    process has a finite number of times *t* [0] < *t* [1] < … < *t* [*T*] . Starting
    from the time *t* [0], it terminates at the time *t* [*T*] , and any two consecutive
    time points are equidistant, that is, *t* [*i*] − *t* [*i*−1] is a positive constant,
    say Δ*t*, where *i* = 1,2,…,*T*. Thus, the time steps *i*Δ*t*, *i* = 1,2,…,*T*,
    correspond, respectively, to the times *t* [1], *t* [2],…,*t* [*T*] . Let *S*
    [*i*] denote the price of the underlying asset at time *t* [*i*] . Assume that
    *S* [0], the price of the asset at the initial period *t* [0], is known. We make
    the following assumptions at the outset. (1) For any *i* = 0,2,…,*T* − 1, at time
    *t* [*i*] , *S* [*i*] either increases to *S* [*i*] *u* or decreases to *S* [*i*]
    *d* at time *t* [*i*]+1, where the unknown parameters *u* and *d* satisfy the
    constraint 0 < *d* < 1 < *u*. Further, for any *i* = 0,2,…,*T* − 1, at *t* [*i*]
    the probability of *S* [*i*] increasing to *S* [*i*] *u* is *p* [*u*] , 0 ≤ *p*
    *u* ≤ 1 and the probability of *S* [*i*] reducing to *S* [*i*] *d* is *p* *d*
    = 1 − *p* [*u*] , where *p* *u* (hence *p* *d* ) are not known. (2) The underlying
    asset is non-dividend paying during the lifespan of the option. (3) There are
    no transaction costs. (4) The rate of interest *r* is risk free throughout the
    lifetime of the option. (5) The risk-neutral valuation principle for the pricing
    and hedging of financial derivatives applies.

    expected rate of return on all assets is the risk-free rate *r*. The associated
    probabilities employed for calculating the expected value are known as risk-neutral
    probabilities, and the implied probability measure is known as a risk-neutral
    probability measure. Consequently, in a risk-neutral financial framework, an investor
    cannot claim any extra return above the risk-free rate *r*, which is as well the
    spontaneous rate of return on a stock. The present value of any cash flow stream
    is the discounted expected value at the risk-free rate. A market model has a risk-neutral
    probability measure if and only it does not provide any scope for arbitrage. (See

    is independent of direction of changes in *S* [*j*] , where *j* = 0,1,…,*i* −
    1\. To understand this more explicitly, we consider the two-period evolution process.
    Note that at the time step Δ*t*, the asset price *S* 1 can take on values ![inline-image](../images/CH004_1.jpg)
    and ![inline-image](../images/CH004_2.jpg) with probabilities *p* *d* and *p*
    [*u*] , respectively. Thus, *S* [1] is stochastic although *S* [0] is non-stochastic.
    (More generally, for any 1 ≤ *i* ≤ *T*, *S* [*i*] is stochastic.) Next, at time
    step 2Δ*t*, the three possible values that *S* [2] can assume are ![inline-image](../images/CH004_3.jpg),
    ![inline-image](../images/CH004_4.jpg) and ![inline-image](../images/CH004_5.jpg),

    2*p* *u* *p* *d* and ![inline-image](../images/CH004_7.jpg). This clearly indicates
    that the direction of change in *S* [1] is independent of direction of changes
    in *S* [0]. Evidently, this is true for all *i* = 1,2,…,T − 1\. Thus, starting
    with a given initial price *S* [0] of the underlying asset, a tree, known as binomial
    tree, of all possible asset prices for the remaining *T* periods can be generated.
    In the general setup, at time step *i*Δ*t*, the sequence of *j* prices is given

- en: The discrete time models for the pricing of derivatives are simple and easy
    to understand. However, they have some disadvantages as well. The range over which
    asset price moves is restricted. This in turn restricts the time points at which
    price movements occur. The length of a trading interval in such a stock price
    evolution process is assumed to be of some reasonable length and the number of
    trading intervals is limited. In a practical situation this may not be so. In
    a perfectly competitive framework where all information are readily accessible,
    largeness of number of trading intervals and smallness of length of an interval
    are quite likely so that trading takes place virtuously continuously. In fact,
    in the limiting situation where the length of the trading interval becomes infinitesimally
    small, the trading process turns out to be continuous, on which the majority of
    option theory relies. In this chapter, we present a concise annotation of the
    celebrated continuous time model, the Black–Scholes (1973)–Merton (1973) model.
    The principal idea that regulates the Black–Scholes–Merton model is hedging to
    wipe out risk. The model establishes that under continuous adjustment of the proportion
    of the stock with option in a portfolio, it is possible to make the portfolio
    riskless.

    of an arbitrary derivative security that depends on *S* [*t*] , the current price
    of the stock, and *t*, the time of commencement of the contract. We now design
    a dynamic strategy that exactly replicates the instantaneous changes in the price
    of the derivative security. A replicating strategy of assets is a scheme that
    exactly reproduces the cash flows of one or more stochastic scenarios. If a trader
    is required to trade continuously to hold this replicating scheme, then it possesses
    a dynamic character. The choice of the scheme is guided by the requirement that
    the market risk is completely eliminated. It is assumed to fulfil the self-financing
    property in the sense that there can be no inflow or outflow of money during its
    lifespan. Any rearrangement in the strategy at time *t* can be made using just
    the money which comes from the initial investment and the gain up to time *t*.
    Equivalently, we say that it is a closed strategy. The two instruments involved

    strategy involving the stock and a risk-free bond can be employed. Other trading
    strategies can be designed to derive this equation. For instance, a dynamic portfolio
    composed of −*q*, short one derivative, and ![inline-image](../images/CH005_72.jpg)

    a change in one or more parameters, suppose a trader's objective is to invest
    *X* units of money in *w* 1 units of a risk-free bond *B*, one long unit of a
    put option and *w* 2 units of the stock, the underlying asset, where the choices
    of *w* 1 and *w* 2 are guided by the requirement that change in *X* should be
    negligible for a small change in the stock price. Now, the value of the portfolio
    consisting of the financial instruments considered is given by *X* = *w* 1 *B*
    + *w* 2 *S* 0 + *P* [*EP*] . Then ![inline-image](../images/CH005_105.jpg), where
    *Delta* *P* and *Delta* *C* stand, respectively, for Deltas of a put and a call.
    Our requirement can now be executed by setting ![inline-image](../images/CH005_106.jpg).
    Consequently, if the trader invests *w* 2 = 1 − *Delta* *C* units in the stock
    and ![inline-image](../images/CH005_107.jpg) units in the bond, the change in
    the total value of the portfolio will be very minor for a small change in the
    stock price. This is Delta hedging, a hedging strategy modelled to keep the value
    of a portfolio of derivatives insensitive to small variations in the price of
    the underlying asset. Such a policy becomes useful when the trader apprehends
    a small reduction in the stock price.

- en: Alternatively, if the trader invests *X* units of money in *w* 1 units of the
    risk-free bond *B*, *w* 2 units of the stock and possesses a short position in
    a call option, then the value of his portfolio becomes *V* = *w* 1 *B* + *w* 2
    *S* 0 − *P* [*EC*] . In such a case, Delta hedging requires ![inline-image](../images/CH005_108.jpg),
    which gives *w* 2 = Delta *C* . Hence the trader invests ![inline-image](../images/CH005_109.jpg)
    units in the bond. The premium received from the sale of the call option can be
    invested such that the trader can meet his obligations at the time of maturity
    of the option. If the value of a portfolio remains unchanged under small variations
    in the value of the underlying asset, then it is called Delta neutral. That is,
    the sum of Deltas across constituents of a portfolio is 0\. In other words, Delta
    neutrality of a portfolio refers to its immunity with respect to minor variations
    in the price of the underlying asset. A trading strategy composed of one unit
    of the stock and some amalgamation of long and short calls and puts on the same
    underlying asset can make the sum of the Deltas across the components of the strategy
    equal to 0\. Thus, the trader can have a long put (call) to hedge a long call
    (put) for downward (upward) asset price changes.

- en: Asian options are one of the most frequently bartered over-the-counter options
    of non-vanilla categories. It is often referred to as the average option since
    its value relies on the average stock price instead of the spot price of the stock.
    It is a path-dependent derivative because it depends on the entire history of
    the underlying asset price starting from its inception. The premium of an Asian
    option is lower than that of a comparable European or an American option. The
    reason behind this is that the volatility associated with the average value of
    the underlying asset is likely to be lower than the volatility of the asset. This
    characteristic of the option makes it less risky. An Asian option is commonly
    traded in currency and commodity markets. While with an increase in the stock
    price the holder of a European call may be able to make large amount of money,
    this is ruled out for the holder of an Asian call since the latter relies on the
    average stock price. This is a negative feature of an Asian option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To determine the payoff function of an Asian option, it is necessary to calculate
    the average stock price, where the averaging principle may be of arithmetic or
    geometric type. We consider a finite number of equidistant time steps, *t* 1 <
    … < *t* *m* indicating that (*t* [*i*] − *t* [*i*]−1) takes on the same value
    for *i* = 2,…,*m*. For a finite positive time series ![inline-image](../images/CH006_1.jpg)
    of stock prices, the geometric mean is defined as ![inline-image](../images/CH006_2.jpg),
    where ‘exp’ and ‘ln’ stand, respectively, for the exponential and logarithmic
    transformations. When the observations on the stock price are sampled continuously
    over the non-degenerate interval [0, *T*], the continuous analogue to the geometric
    average defined above comes to be ![inline-image](../images/CH006_3.jpg). Here
    we are going to adopt the geometric averaging rule since underlying asset prices
    have a lognormal distribution when the price follows a (*μ*, *σ*)-geometric Brownian
    motion, where *μ* and *σ* are, respectively, the drift and volatility components
    of the motion. Given that risk neutrality holds, we can replace *μ* by the risk-free
    interest rate *r*. (See Section 4.2 of Chapter 4 and Section 5.5 of Chapter 5.)

    by decreasing the price of the underlying asset. Thus, we can categorise these
    four options into two broader subgroups – Ups (the asset price starts from a level
    below the barrier and increases up to it) and Downs (the asset starts from a level
    above the barrier and reduces down to it). They can also be categorised as knockout
    or extinguishable options that cease to be active when the asset price hits the
    barrier and knock-in or lightable options that become active as soon as the asset
    price breaches the barrier. Therefore, the barrier can be above or below the asset
    price at the time of initiation of the contract. Barrier options, which are less
    expensive than standard options, can be useful as hedging instruments when the
    investor has potential idea about the movement of the asset price. To determine
    the payoff structure of the barrier options, let *S* *M* and *S* *m* denote, respectively,

- en: Consider a person who is exploring the possibility of investing in one of the
    two prospects or assets, say stocks, *A* and *B*, whose rates of returns (returns,
    for short) are uncertain. It is natural for the investor to choose the stock whose
    expected return is higher. A risk-averse investor also becomes biased towards
    the choice of an asset whose expected return is not associated with high risk.
    One proposition to the resolution to this problem is the mean-variance approach
    (see Markowitz, 1959; Tobin, 1958), where the variance of returns is taken as
    an indicator of risk. In the well-known Markowitz model of portfolio management,
    the quadratic utility function, the mean return minus a positive constant multiple
    of the variance, is taken as the expected utility function of an investor. In
    this model, a risk-averse investor's objective becomes designing a portfolio to
    maximise expected return for a given level of risk or to minimise risk when the
    expected return is given. But the Markowitz approach, although quite appealing,
    relies on a specific expected utility function. Furthermore, two investments cannot
    be unambiguously ranked if one of them has a higher expected return accompanied
    by a higher variance. Alternative weaker concepts, with extensive applications,
    that can rank uncertain prospects have been suggested in the literature. They
    can be defined without having knowledge about an investors' trade-off between
    return and risk, as represented by his utility function. These ranking criteria,
    the stochastic dominance relations, are the subject of this chapter.

    Neumann–Morgenstern utility function *U* defined on [*a*, *b*], that is, ![inline-image](../images/CH007_6.jpg),
    where ![inline-image](../images/CH007_7.jpg) is the real line. Assume that *U*
    is twice continuously differentiable. The first- and second-order derivatives
    of *U* are denoted by ![inline-image](../images/CH007_8.jpg) and ![inline-image](../images/CH007_9.jpg),
    respectively. It is assumed throughout that ![inline-image](../images/CH007_10.jpg),
    which means that *U* is increasing, an assumption that reflects the view that
    more is preferred to less. Given increasingness, we also assume that *U* is strictly
    concave, that is, ![inline-image](../images/CH007_11.jpg). Strict concavity of
    a person's utility function is related to his attitude towards risk. An individual
    is called risk averse if he prefers his current wealth to any fair gamble in which
    there is a 50–50 chance of losing some amount out of the current wealth or winning
    the same amount. A person is risk averse if and only if *U* is strictly concave.
    This is also necessary and sufficient for the Arrow (1970)-Pratt (1964) absolute
    and relative coefficients of risk aversion; defined, respectively, as ![inline-image](../images/CH007_12.jpg)
    and ![inline-image](../images/CH007_13.jpg) to be positive, where ![inline-image](../images/CH007_14.jpg).
    A person possessing a utility function *U* satisfying strict convexity ![inline-image](../images/CH007_15.jpg)
    is risk lover and these measures are negative for him. While a risk-loving person
    prefers high variability among levels of returns on a prospect, a risk averter
    dislikes this. In contrast to these two extreme positions, if the individual's
    utility function is linear ![inline-image](../images/CH007_16.jpg), then these
    two coefficients take on the value zero; and the individual is regarded as risk
    neutral.

    with uncertain returns, if the former first stochastic dominates the latter then
    the former will be preferred to the latter by all individuals who prefer more
    to less. The converse is also true. Thus, if the stochastic dominance condition
    (1) in Theorem 7.1 is demonstrated, we do not need to have information on the
    form of the utility function to judge whether the expected utility of the former
    is higher than that of the latter. However, although the ordering is transitive
    and irreflexive, it is not complete. To understand this, note that ![inline-image](../images/CH007_21.jpg)
    requires that the graph of *F* *A* can never lie above that of *F* [*B*] , that
    is, the two graphs can never intersect. If the two graphs intersect at least once
    we can get two different utility functions which will rank the prospects *A* and
    *B* in different directions with respect to expected utility values. Thus, ![inline-image](../images/CH007_22.jpg)
    is a partial or quasi-ordering.

    two are strictly concave, the next two are strictly convex and the fifth one displays
    risk neutrality. However, if ![inline-image](../images/CH007_29.jpg) is substantiated
    then for all of them *A* is preferred to *B* by the expected utility criterion.
    This is because under the first-order stochastic dominance criterion, the only
    distinguishing feature between two uncertain prospects is efficiency, that is,
    desirability for a higher expected utility. Consideration about the decision maker's
    attitude towards risks is totally absent. In other words, this principle of ranking
    prospects does not tell us whether a person is risk lover, risk averter or risk
    neutral. This issue is addressed by the second-order stochastic dominance rule,
    which we analyse below.

    . While for *U* 1, *AP* *A* (*z*) is decreasing, for *U* 2 it remains constant.
    Decreasingness of *AP* *A* holds only if marginal utility function is strictly
    convex, that is, ![inline-image](../images/CH007_65.jpg). In this case, the demand
    for the underlying risky prospect increases when the individual's wealth increases
