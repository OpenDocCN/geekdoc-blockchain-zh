- en: Essentially, a crypto exchange is a digital marketplace in which traders can
    buy and sell cryptos using different fiat currencies (or other items of value).
    It’s an online platform that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers.
    A crypto exchange functions similarly to a traditional stock exchange. It matches
    buyers and sellers, allowing customers to make trades.

- en: The first such exchange was a Bitcoin exchange founded in October of 2009\.
    It was named New Liberty Standard and was located in New York. It was a place
    where people could exchange Bitcoins for fiat money, or fiat money for Bitcoins.
    Martti Malmi, an early Bitcoin evangelist, supported New Liberty Standard by investing
    5050 Bitcoins as seed money. In return, he received a whopping $5.02 USD via PayPal.
    When it was launched, New Liberty Standard estimated the value of Bitcoins based
    on the consumption of electricity per Bitcoin cost. Based on this valuation system,
    between October and November of 2009, the exchange rate between Bitcoins and US
    dollars was approximately 1000 to 1.

- en: ERC-20 is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
    for implementing tokens. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. Today, ERC-20
    drives an increasing amount of tokens into the crypto world through ICOs. ERC-20
    was first proposed in November of 2015, and it functioned such that any token
    that complied with ERC-20 would be compatible with Ethereum wallets. With ERC-20,
    developers can also build apps (DAPPs), and people who build DAPPs usually issue
    tokens as “currency” to be used within the DAPP. These tokens are not allowed
    to be directly traded for fiat money. They have to first be exchanged for Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. However, the creation of ERC-20 is important to the history of exchanges
    because of the “currency within a currency” it makes possible. Clearly, the appetite
    for trading between cryptos is not diminishing.

    were a major force in the global crypto market. BTCC, founded in 2011, is generally
    considered to have been the first crypto exchange in China. The volume of trading
    on BTCC was immense, among the top three global exchanges. Yet, like many others,
    BTCC was asked to close in 2017\. Current exchanges like Huobi, OKcoin, and Binance
    were all founded by teams originating in China.

    of the crypto economy. They’re also a place where true entrepreneurs and innovators
    rub elbows with speculators and scam artists. Their lack of regulation often creates
    a vacuum in which people can take advantage of one another. In the United States,
    Japan, and South Korea, all exchanges are registered domestically, which means
    that they exist under strict government regulation. China was one of the markets
    that initially adopted the strictest regulations for cryptocurrency. Yet China
    eventually decided the risk was not worth the reward and shut them down completely.

    exchanges.

    the assurance of transparency, and the ability to pin trades to the current market
    price. It is true that there are certain risks associated with exchange trading—such
    as inner management risks, unethical business practices on the part of the exchange
    itself, and the potential for asset misappropriation fraud. However, decentralized
    exchanges can address many of these risks and issues. If you compare centralized
    exchanges with decentralized exchanges, you’ll find big differences between the
    two.

    and asset clearance. Centralized exchanges also provide sophisticated solutions
    for clients in terms of asset management. They have flexible approaches when it
    comes to charging clients. These exchanges will charge users trading fees, initial
    listing fees related to ICOs, and so forth.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, were once the hottest thing in the
    crypto market because of their different approach. In June of 2017, Bancor Protocal
    initiated a crowd-funding ICO to establish a multilayered system of currency wherein
    one token could be be “reserved” for another. It aimed to set the new standard
    for cryptocurrency exchanges. (As a decentralized exchange, Bancor Network relies
    on smart contracts to match trades and execute them automatically.) The ICO raised
    $153 million worth of Ethereum. (By then, the market price of Ethereum was $273.)
    It was the most valuable ICO in history at the time. Bancor’s ICO also received
    the endorsement of well-known investors, including Tim Draper, the American venture
    capitalist. (Even though Bancor has a very successful ICO, it would not be correct
    to say it has become “the star” of decentralized exchanges. The twenty-four-hour
    trading volume of Bancor is only $6 million, far behind competitors like Kybernetwork
    and IDEX.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Decentralized exchanges like Bancor’s satisfy all the demands of investors and
    traders that centralized exchanges fail to address. Centralized exchanges use
    a strong ICO filtering system that many find too exclusive. Decentralized exchanges
    support the trading of any token based on ERC-20\. Decentralized exchanges also
    have a lower market barrier than centralized ones. Some ICOs that are less fortunate
    in their “launch phases”—meaning they don’t receive cornerstone investments or
    cannot afford the cost of being in centralized exchanges—find that decentralized
    exchanges remain an effective way for them to raise capital.

    biggest and most dominant Ethereum decentralized exchanges. About 230 different
    tokens were actively traded on it. Many ICOs would use it to offer exclusive token
    sales to investors and institutional investors two days before they were available
    to the public. Because of this, EtherDelta was a popular starting point for ICOs
    and at its peak had millions of users.

    increase in market value—the exchanges carrying it draw increasing attention from
    hackers. Hackers try their best to find any loopholes in the exchanges that will
    allow them to steal cryptos. (We have talked about the DAO project that ultimately
    forced Ethereum into two blockchains.) Safety and security were also the issues
    that brought down EtherDelta. Many users trusted implicitly that a decentralized
    exchange would be safe from hacking. However, EtherDelta was hacked multiple times.
    EtherDelta doesn’t use a traditional computer server. Instead, it’s all backed
    up on Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract. It is a true DAPP, a distributed
    app existing in the crypto world. When users trade on EtherDelta, they need to
    create a wallet that can talk to the smart contract. EtherDelta is what’s often
    called a “wholesome wallet solution.” EtherDelta users need to input a public
    key and a private key when they access their wallets. It is this step that puts
    users in a spot where they become the target of hackers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    entering the safety loopholes in EtherDelta and inputting malicious code that
    would farm private keys from users’ wallets and then steal their tokens. But in
    December of 2017, hackers directly targeted the exchange’s DNS server, which shocked
    everyone and resulted in losses across the exchange. EtherDelta has now lost the
    trust of most of its users and is largely considered a “has-been.”

    fees and charge token sale fees related to ICOs. Leading centralized exchanges
    are realizing profits in the millions on a daily basis, simply due to the overwhelming
    volume of the trading they facilitate. (According to Recode, Coinbase, an American
    Bitcoin exchange, had revenues of over $1 billion in 2017\. Binance, now based
    in Japan, expects a net profit of $500 million to $1 billion in 2018, according
    to its chief executive officer, Changpeng Zhao. And the volume of cryptocurrency
    trading is only going to increase in the days ahead.)

    most severe hacking incidents in cryptocurrency history, resulting in losses of
    $30 million. In the aftermath, Bithumb promised to refund the hacking victims’
    losses using its own reserve.

    more and more similar to entities like NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.
    Centralized exchanges have developed well-established trading systems that attract
    ICOs and investors. They are even beginning to attract “market makers.” In the
    traditional financial industry, market makers can be brokerage houses or independent
    security dealers who assist investors with the selling and buying of securities.
    Market makers provide liquidity to the market and make it easy for investors to
    sell and buy at any moment. Decentralized exchanges support person-to-person trading,
    but their lack of market makers may become yet another hurdle.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial listing fee for an ICO on a centralized exchange can be a lot of
    money. How much exactly? Currently, there is no agreed-upon standard. The cost
    of listing an ICO on an exchange largely depends on the liquidity and structure
    of the exchange itself. Exchanges with high liquidity will charge more to list
    an ICO. The cost will also be related to the “heat” of the ICO. During the peak
    of the ICO market in 2017, the cost to list an ICO on a centralized exchange crept
    to between $1 million and $2 million on the top ten exchanges with the highest
    liquidity levels. Compare that to what stock exchanges charge for an IPO. According
    to NASDAQ, the initial listing fee of an IPO is usually between $125,000 and $300,000
    (excluding the yearly listing fee). Yet for many startups and investors, an ICO
    is a much easier way to raise capital. Startups benefit from the low cost of money,
    and early investors like getting in on exciting young technologies before everyone
    else. Keeping ICOs attractive in the future will be the single factor that most
    determines if the success of these exchanges continues. Not all exchanges profit
    through their initial listing fees. Some have instead implemented community voting
    as part of the selection criteria for new tokens, and they charge a small fee
    for each vote. (This helps ensure that fake or fraudulent coins not be introduced
    and also gives the exchange a tidy profit.) Voters pay each time they cast a ballot.
    More votes means more support for an ICO, and more profit for the exchange.

- en: Bibox, an exchange that I cofounded, uses both an initial listing fee and community
    voting to select and list ICOs. A few high-quality projects will be listed on
    the exchange directly after providing legal papers and paying an initial listing
    fee, but the rest go through the community voting procedure. To stay competitive
    in this fast-evolving industry, Bibox is constantly improving its community voting
    mechanism to make the process easier and better. In Bibox’s earliest days, community
    voting was much more simple and direct. Any user could simply open an account
    on Bibox and start voting. Today, voters pay one token (issued by Bibox) each
    time they vote. One person can vote 10,000 times if he or she wants to.

- en: Some exchanges have also introduced the “super node” model. To be a super node
    in the community, a person (or a group of people or institutions) must reserve
    a certain amount of tokens issued by the exchange. They are also required to have
    investments with the exchange. But the votes of these super nodes, as you might
    imagine, can settle an issue once and for all. Initially, super nodes were only
    seen in crypto investment funds. Now, however, the model has slowly been migrating
    into traditional venture capital spaces.

- en: The notion of “consensus” is a concept that’s bigger than crypto. It can touch
    all aspects of human society. But when it comes to the financial world, consensus
    can be dominated by institutional investors or powerful groups. This is a problem,
    because it’s a reversion back to centralization. Community consensus ought to
    be a way to create balance between elites and the majority. That’s why Bibox’s
    next step will be to introduce third-party valuation into the consensus-reaching
    process. Under our model, one third of voting rights will be given to super nodes,
    one third will be the community’s, and the rest will be reserved for the exchange
    itself.

    it’s a super node or an individual investor, voting is always going to be based
    on how many tokens a group or person holds. In the case of Bibox, each community
    member is entitled to voting rights equivalent to tokens held. Before voting for
    an ICO, each voting member needs to reserve a certain amount of tokens.

    hold onto the coin, the more voting rights they will have when it comes to issuing
    more DAI next year. Ideally, under this model, everyone is supposed to be involved

    good example, having recently become one of the top ten global exchanges. Fcoin
    introduced the concept of “trading is mining” in June of 2018, and it has been
    attracting many investors and traders. This model came about after a loophole
    was exploited in Fcoin’s way of doing business. Fcoin announced it would cease
    using 30 percent referral fees. The day after the announcement, its trading volume
    decreased by 5 percent. But with the launch of the “trading is mining” model,
    it has become more successful than it ever was before! The model of “trading is
    mining” is innovative and exciting, and others are adopting it. Coinpark, for
    example, has also moved to a “trading is mining” format. Yet Coinpark goes even
    further than Fcoin. Newly listed tokens go to Bibox first, and the ones who “survive”
    the filtering system will then go to Coinpark. It is essentially an exchange for
    quality tokens!

    for self-discipline. As I noted at the outset, exchanges are commonly known as
    the “top of the food chain.” They control the ebb and flow of trade and play a
    crucial role in the token economy. Exchanges are not supposed to support insider
    trading in either the prime market or the secondary market. Because of their influence,
    any policy or rule an exchange introduces will probably have a powerful influence
    on the market as a whole. In the early days of crypto, there were many “gray areas”
    when it came to crypto exchanges. Many investors made a fast buck with unethical
    business practices. Yet the crypto exchanges expelled the bad elements because
    they had to. There was no other way to continue to exist. It is my belief that
    to move forward effectively, the exchanges will have to acknowledge that their
    journey of self-improvement is far from over.

    make the case that we are not opposed to any regulation. In fact, it must be shown
    that crypto can be regulated. The best case scenario, of course, is that the industry
