    of a person identified by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008\. But since then,
    blockchain has gone through radical growth with the assured support in every dimension
    of applications in the information technology world. Meanwhile the question in

    transaction ledger with the idea of recording those transactions across numerous

    in with series of time-stamps which cannot be changed and which are organized
    by a set of computers, not possessed by any sole unit. The time-stamped record
    in the series can be viewed as a block, and by means of cryptographic algorithms,
    the blocks are fully bound to one another. Hence, the blocks and the chain of
    the interlinked blocks lead to the term blockchain.

    any domain put up on the blockchain will be in the public domain, and anyone involved

    does not require any transaction cost. The underlying mechanism in blockchain
    is simple, secured, effective and robust transactions between any two systems
    by automated means. It can be viewed as a transaction between any two parties.
    In this scenario, the first party namely “A” initiates and requests a transaction
    from the other party “B”. The initialization of the transaction is followed by
    the creation of a block. This block is broadcasted to all the computers distributed
    in the network. The block is verified by all the systems in the network and validated.
    This verified and validated block is added to a chain and the chain is stored
    across the network; the birth of new exclusive record with a unique history. The
    transactions are done with verification and executed between “A” and “B”. Any
    scenario which affects a single record falsely will in turn incorrectly affect
    the entire chain coupled with the blocks in millions of instances.

    through the website. Usually the credit or debit card service providers demand
    a processing fee for their services. Using the blockchain technology, railway
    systems can eliminate the processing fee and even enhance the efficiency of the
    entire process. In this picture the railway system can be seen as “A” and the
    customer can be viewed as “B”. The ticket can be an individual block of a record
    which is validated and added to the chain. A ticket is autonomously verifiable
    and immutable like any financial transaction one carries out in day-to-day life.
    The entire transaction, including the particular train route, train network, each
    ticket sold and each journey traveled in the route, can be viewed as a record.
    The people involved in this transaction to update or modify by any means are completely
    responsible for the transaction.

    programming concept of data encapsulation. So in this IoT world, we can understand
    that the spontaneous flow of incredible volumes of data from numerous devices
    may lead to the leakage of data or unauthorized access of data if it does not
    provide guaranteed security mechanisms. We can visualize some of the privacy challenges

    effective tool for the protection of privacy and security of data in the IoT era.
    Blockchain security primarily originates from a cryptographic puzzle identified
    as proof of work (PoW), used for adding new blocks into the chain. The unfixed
    public key for the users’ identities is used by blockchain to render a high level
    of privacy. The salient features of blockchain and its usage in various non-financial

    of blockchain without compromising the privacy and security benefits extracted
    from blockchain implementation. They have focused on the optimization of resource
    ingestion and increasing the network scalability by adopting a hierarchical structure.
    The structure for optimization comprises a smart home, overlay network and cloud
    storage as three different tiers.

    a private immutable ledger (IL), which can be visualized as a blockchain but with
    the difference of central management and symmetric encryption to lessen the processing
    overhead. Another difference in the case of blockchain is that the devices requiring
    greater resources mutually create a distributed overlay that instantiates a public
    blockchain. The transactions are the communications held between the entities
    in the mentioned different tiers which are assembled into blocks. These blocks
    are attached to the chain without resolving the PoW, which reduces the appending
    overhead considerably. The verified and validated transactions are accessible
    for the complete network instantaneously. This mechanism potentially decreases
    the delay of IoT transactions, like data access or queries. The possible salient
    distributed trust method can be used in the overlay to decrease the processing
    overhead in authenticating new blocks.

    an extensive growth in the number of applications and together IoT devices are

    by a report of Gartner and Cisco. But cloud-based IoT suffers from issues of latency,
    bandwidth and connectivity since the computing takes place at the center of the
    network. The industrial IoT (IIoT) applications for smart cities, smart factories,
    smart grids and smart farms are not compatible with cloud-based architectures
    due to the aforesaid issues. Therefore there is paradigm shift towards edge computing-based
    application development which may be well-suited for such IIoTs. Edge computing
    coupled with IoT can avoid all the issues of latency, bandwidth and connectivity.

    the user in finding the pitfalls of any IoT device and unveils its vulnerability
    for restructuring. Using blockchain in any IoT ecosystem will certainly boost
    the trustworthiness by absolutely eradicating some single point of failure. The
    hashing algorithms along with cryptographic mechanisms are used in blockchain,
    to encrypt the data which can yield the best security mechanisms while binding
    it with IoT. Meanwhile, the flip side of the IoT with respect to the demand of
    high computing power while using hashing methods and cryptographic techniques
    is a challenge when combining the blockchain technology with IoT. But the research
    is going on to overcome these issues at the blockchain level itself.

    concept to record its transactions with reserved safeties. Because of the advantages
    of blockchain, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), USA, is also working
    with Axoni for the monetary payment facilities such as post-trade stuffs and trades.
    The government regulatory boards are also keen on blockchain for its capability
    to render safe, secluded, distinguishable simultaneous watching of trades.

    Therefore, the blockchain can preclude damaging information by handling and safeguarding
    industrial IoT gadgets. In this wonderful fully protected scenario, once a sensor,
    device or controller is deployed and starts functioning, there is no room for
    any modification, and subsequently any changes in the device will be traced in
    the blockchain.

    processes and mechanisms connected to the Internet ([Figure 3.2](chapter3.xhtml#fig3.2)).
    Since we have seen the large-scale IoT systems in the previous topic which includes
    all the necessary cutting-edge technologies, we can view a smart home too with
    those technologies. In the proposed case study, let us have IoT and cloud computing
    as major building blocks integrated to experience the vital power of blockchain.

    all the transactions. It takes all inward- and outward-bound communications and
    makes use of a public key for local transactions with IoT devices and native storage.

    proprietor to approve the established transactions. Overlay nodes or the devices
    inside the home might produce transactions with the purpose of sharing, requesting
    or storing data. We can assume that the cluster head which is the head of a set
    of devices, a node in the intersection or the cloud storage can be the adversary.
    The adversary is capable of fabricating transactions or deleting the data or making
    unwanted links to the nodes or authenticating bogus transactions.

    using a comprehensive Diffie–Hellman algorithm with a shared key. The shared key
    should be assigned by the miner to devices for direct communication with each
    other to accomplish user control over smart home transactions. Keeping data on
    the local storage, each device is required to be authenticated to the storage
    using a shared key. The locally stored data can be moved to the cloud storage
    in what is known as a store transaction which is an anonymous process. The additional
    likely transactions are access and monitor transactions. These transactions are
    primarily produced by the home proprietor to observe the home when she/he is outside.

    violate the policies, then these packets will be dropped. The second-level defense
    is that any device attached to the local blockchain will be allowed to make a
    transaction only after genuine authentication at SHM. If any device is found to
    be genuine it will be isolated from the network.
