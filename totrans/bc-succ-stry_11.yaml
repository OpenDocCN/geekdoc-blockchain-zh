    automobiles (manufacturing new cars using recycled parts), and farming (reducing

    the company to grow its platform and partnerships. In September 2019, Everledger

    known as the creator of WeChat, one of the most powerful social media apps in

    of an asset’s origin, characteristics, and ownership.”^([28](ch11.html#ch01fn172))
    This transparency would add more value to the final product by allowing companies
    and consumers to see the story of their stuff. This, in turn, would speed the
    development of a circular economy, where products could be reused, recycled, and
    remanufactured, reducing waste and making the global economy more efficient.
