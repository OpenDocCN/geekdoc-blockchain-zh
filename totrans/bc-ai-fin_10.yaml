- en: This book is a wide ranging analysis and conversation around both the emerging
    technologies and the implications that these emerging technologies will have on
    different aspects of the finance and accounting. Such an analysis and examination,
    however, would be incomplete without at least mentioning how these changes are
    being viewed from a bigger picture and macroeconomic level. Data and other quantitative
    information are, as has been discussed both in this text as well as numerous others,
    may very well represent the next competitive advantage for organizations both
    now and going forward. Stepping outside of the financial services arena for a
    brief minute this trend is arguably more evident in search, social media, and
    the entertainment spaces. Technology giants such as Google, Facebook, Alibaba,
    Amazon, and Netflix have access – and use – the vast quantities of information
    available to them to generate new insights, improve business models, and increase
    margins. These advances and business improvements, however, have not come without
    costs and increased regulatory scrutiny. One need merely to look at the hearings
    that Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Apple have had to contend with during 2017
    and beyond to see that as corporate power increases governments across the globe
    will become increasingly interested.

    as points of friction and increased cost. Figure [8.1](#Fig1) presents what, from
    a consumer perspective is a simple transaction (the usage of a credit card), with
    each break in the diagram representing a point of cost, time delays and organizational
    friction. Such commonplace instances of cost and friction also seem to be encouraging
    the broader adoption of blockchain and other emerging technology tools.![../images/467992_1_En_8_Chapter/467992_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_8_Chapter/467992_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png)

    from what is already occurring in the financial services space as emerging technology
    play an increasingly important role. Drilling down specifically, and returning
    the conversation to the financial services space, the regulatory pressure facing
    organizations is already high and set to increase. Taking publicly available statements
    and memos, it does seem that financial organizations are going to come under increased
    regulatory scrutiny – at least in the United States – as Democrats consolidate
    power and assume various positions of leadership in the U.S. Congress. Not entirely
    unfounded as a result of both memories of the Great Recession and the increases
    in consolidation that have followed, blockchain and other emerging technologies
    may actually increase the pace of consolidation and market concentration. This
    might seem like a contraction to the underlying ethos of blockchain, which supporters
    contend will eventually disrupt the financial system entirely, but upon future
    examination it does indeed make sense. Information itself, including but not limited
    to the quantitative data that drives, and will continue to drive, the success
    or failure of different firms, requires scale and professional competency.

    the ability to finance and contend with these new rules and guidelines, information
    and data do tend to concentrate at the larger organizations. Potentially amplifying
    the trends and forces already underway at different areas of the marketplace,
    these very technologies meant to disrupt established players may actually lead
    to increased concentration over time. Not as far fetched as some may assume, the
    shift toward centralized exchanges are already increasing in importance in the
    marketplace.

    technological details of any particular service or tool, but is rather connected
    to offering appropriate services in technologically dominated environment. In
    order to do so, however, practitioners need to understand one of the driving forces
    and trends that continues to shape the blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape.
    Perhaps the most significant iteration and representation of this overarching
    change and trend in how business is conducted is the development and refinement
    of what is commonly known as lex cryptographica or the creation of a new legal
    and business system centered around cryptography and decentralized operations
    versus the current centralized and traditional model.

    concerned with – after all there is not usually Latin in the day to day operations
    of a financial professionals – this is an important trend that is critical to
    understand. Taking a step back, and returning to the conversation connected to
    financial services, there are several considerations that must be taken into account
    as this trend continues to emerge unabated.

- en: Blockchain may actually increase the risk associated with the financial system.
    Many of the proponents and advocates for increased blockchain adoption and integration
    emphasize the benefits, including reduced risk associated with financial transactions
    and data storage. The combination of a virtually immutable record with unhackable
    (until this point) encryption means that data will in fact be more secure than
    under previous systems. Even with these benefits, however, the centralized system
    and model that currently underpins the financial system does generate numerous
    efficiencies and protections, especially for consumers. Thinking back to the origin
    of the current financial system and construct, the centralization trend that dominates
    the marketplace means that consumers are protected, insurance and other risk reducing
    strategies are possible, and that risk can be shared between counterparties. A
    distributed and decentralized financial system, lacking a centralized clearinghouse,
    could expose counterparties and institutions to risk that is currently offset
    and contained by regulations and frameworks. Certainly, a distributed and decentralized
    model can, and already is, allowing more and more participants access to capital
    markets and information, but there is also a risk from an institutional perspective
    that must be assessed as well.

    2, is an important fiduciary role that financial professionals must play and fulfill
    in the marketplace. Specifically, and in accordance with the responsibility professionals
    have to protect investors, financial and accounting professionals have a duty
    to examine, contest, and hold the data reported by management to a certain level
    of scrutiny. Although the blockchain concept, at the core of the idea, emphasizes
    transparency and encryption; this paradox exposes a flaw in the model that could
    eventually undermine the validity of corporate governance initiatives.

    associated to the rise of such a business model and landscape focusing on the
    lex cryptographica model of operating and conducting business. Cryptography, by
    its very nature, creates opportunities for professionals who understand not only
    how the cryptography functions on an operational level, but also how the impact
    of cryptography drives other business process improvements. For example, if consumers
    and organizations are more confident in the security and protection over financial
    information, it becomes simpler to engage in cross border and cross industry transactions.
    Taking a look at actual examples, imagine an entrepreneur or small business owner
    looking to access capital markets, but being unable to do so; something financial
    planners and CPAs must advise clients on continuously. Even with crowdfunding
    platforms such as Kickstarter becoming increasingly prevalent and widespread,
    these services continue to rely on a centralized clearinghouse and approval process.

- en: A blockchain based platform, however, which we will discuss in more detail later
    in this text, can enable greater and more widespread entrepreneurship by allowing
    a more peer to peer based model of capital attraction and raising. In terms of
    financial analysis and accounting, however, there are also opportunities for professionals
    motivated to offer additional advisory and assurance services. For example, if
    capital is being raised on blockchain based network – and whether or not it is
    raised via cryptocurrencies or fiat capital – remaining in compliance with existing
    regulations is something that must be addressed. One of the core components and
    benefits of a blockchain based model is the anonymity of pseudo anonymity provided
    to network members. The rise of privacy coins such as Zcash and Monero are seeking
    to improvement and augment the existing privacy rules and guidelines surrounding
    traditional cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Being able to track both different
    pieces of ownership and custody via advanced computer forensics and other software
    tools undermines one of the core components and benefits most commonly associated
    with blockchain technology.

- en: Financial professionals comfortable with discussing the various aspects of blockchain
    and cryptocurrencies can seize on these options and opportunities. Remaining in
    compliance and well informed about the emerging regulatory issues driving both
    the financial and broader business landscape moving forward can allow firms and
    organizations to expand current offerings as well as developing new options as
    well. That said, and acknowledging the reality that increasing amounts of cryptography
    inserted into business operations will create benefits and options for motivated
    professionals it is also reasonable to acknowledge that such a distributed and
    decentralized model also crates challenges at the very core of the financial services
    profession.

- en: Lex cryptographica, while not representing an entirely new technology or model
    of operating – after all cryptography has been around for hundreds of years –
    does pose a unique set of challenges for practitioners. The primary driver of
    this challenge returns to exactly what some of the benefits of blockchain and
    cryptocurrency are in the context of business processes and operations. Anonymity
    is an often cited benefit and positive attributed associated of blockchain, but
    not every business situation calls for or is appropriate for anonymous communication.
    Counterparty risk, the same type of risk that threatened to undermine the global
    financial system during the Great Recession, can actually be amplified in a situation
    or landscape with increased anonymity. The entirety of trade finance and the flowing
    of funds between different institutions and organizations relies on a sophisticated
    system and infrastructure of insurance, identity verification, and risk reducing
    tools that could possibly be undermined due to the identities of certain individuals
    or associated organizations being obscured. This is not new news or information;
    these attributes and potential risks associated with blockchain have been relatively
    well documented since the introduction of cryptocurrency and blockchain to the
    mainstream business conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Focusing back to the financial services profession, however, there are several
    different implications that have an effect directly on various aspects of the
    financial services profession and landscape. First, from an accounting perspective
    there are multiple situations in which increased anonymity or encryption connected
    to different types of data and information, and a few of these are linked directly
    to audit and attestation services. For example, how would an auditor and audit
    team be able to accurately assess the value and ownership of various assets that
    are stored or governed by a blockchain based model of storage and transmission.
    Verifying valuation and different types of information and data, especially those
    connected to assets owned or controlled by an entity, form an important point
    of any audit or attestation engagement. If, however, custody, transference, and
    value of assets are obscured or hidden via different layers of cryptography this
    adds extra layers of complexity to the conversation.

    and accountants perform specific duties and responsibilities connected to the
    reporting and communication of information. Whether or not the business does business
    on a purely domestic basis or engages in international trade and commerce, businesses
    must be able to confirm that balances – from an investment, payable, and receivable
    side – are accurately accounted for and reported. While the transparency affiliated
    with information and data stored on a blockchain model certainly helps with the
    communication of data, but that same transparency can actually pose issues and
    concerns for the auditing and attesting to information and data, both linked to
    operational and financial information.

- en: While organizations are used to, obviously, allowing accounting professionals
    and auditors to have access to virtually every type of information produced and
    stored and entity, storing this same information on a consortium or network blockchain
    based model is not something organizations are accustomed to doing. Obviously
    the encryption and security associated with blockchains can help alleviate some
    of these concerns, but that is only a partial solution. As has been mentioned
    throughout this text, no encryption is perfect, and hear is where an additional
    items or piece of information may be helpful. Setting up a private blockchain
    and consortium model. Consortium based or private blockchain models offer additional
    benefits from an enterprise perspective via the ability to customize which stakeholders
    and parties of the network have access to which pieces of information.

- en: In addition to the states benefits and challenges that are can be associated
    with the rise of a new legalistic system and way of doing business, there are
    also several implications that such a new model of conducting business and confirming
    information. Entire books and presentations have been dedicated to addressing
    the changing and evolving needs of practitioners, but for the sake of brevity
    let’s focus on two that seem to be among the most important or wide ranging in
    nature. Especially if practitioners are seeking to engage in new services, businesses,
    or other sorts of business activities, it is important for these some professionals
    to understand just what will be necessary in order to do so moving forward. Let’s
    take a look at two definitive shifts already underway in the marketplace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, teams of practitioners and professionals will need to become more diverse,
    both in terms of personnel and the skill sets that are brought to the conversation.
    These skills are going to include a variety of different factors, including but
    not limited to legal, technical, communicative, and analytical problem solving
    competencies. While this might not seem like news or a piece of information that
    is new to anyone who is actually working in the profession, the implications are
    just beginning to be understood. At the core of this shift is the underlying market
    reality that, even at the Top 100 accounting firms, CPAs only account for approximately
    20% of staff that deal with client issues, down from approximately 33% of staff
    just a decade ago. If even the largest CPA firms, with long held (and deserved)
    expertise for financial reporting, tax, and attestation engagements are only employing
    a relatively small percentage of employees that are CPAs this demonstrates serious
    implications for the rest of the financial services landscape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, but connected to this shift occurring under the surface at the largest
    accounting organizations, is the fact that a similar shift is already underway
    in trading, investment, and capital market firms. Some of the most high profile
    hedge funds and investment pools in the world, including those based in the United
    States and internationally, are increasingly driven and managed by quantitative
    analysts and traders versus traditional financial analysts. The CFA designation
    is, and still remains, a robust and very much respected credential in the marketplace,
    but is not necessary anymore to launch a trading organization. The real question
    is, and will continue to be, that even if venerable designations such as the CPA
    and CFA designations are ceding ground to technology and quantitative professionals,
    what does this mean for professionals working without said credentials and experience.
    Not meant to inspire anxiety, but simply meant as a reality check for practitioners
    or firms that are not appreciating the disruptive nature of these emerging technologies;
    they are already in the marketplace and are driving change across different organizations.
    Such change, however disruptive it may be, also creates opportunities for organizations
    and firms willing to drill down, engage in new market areas, and be proactive
    members of the financial technology community.

- en: After working through some of the technical terminology and concepts that are
    driving change within the broader financial services profession it’s a good idea
    to take a step back and to frame the conversation before drilling down into specific
    business implications. The view from the top should be thought of as an opportunity
    to research, view, and frame out the specific business implications of emerging
    technologies on financial services. While not always specifically applicable to
    every financial services role or professional, being able to see and understand
    how emerging technologies fit into the business landscape at large is an integral
    part of how finance can play a more strategic role in the business decision making
    process. Offering strategic advice and guidance to clients across any number of
    sector lines means that professionals must understand from a technical and operational
    perspective. This is what is addressed in this next section of the book; applications
    and implications of emerging technology tools. Part II of this book attempts to
    break down, and provide actionable business intelligence, related to how emerging
    can – and already is – being used across different industry lines. This section
    of the book should be thought of as a tool and framework to help professionals
    see how these technologies are being used, understand what future applications
    can be developed, and learn from leading firms in the space.
