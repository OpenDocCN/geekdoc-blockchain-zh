- en: This book aims to be accessible to novices who have some basic working experience
    with computers, and at least *some* experience with programming. Knowing how to
    program is not a strict necessity, although it may help in grasping some concepts.
    The book also assumes some experience with high school mathematics, such as functions.

- en: One of the reasons for writing this book is that I could not find a single book
    that explained how to implement blockchain from scratch, covering all the details.
    I had to do a lot of research on the Internet to come up with a complete picture
    of what blockchain is, how one can implement it, and what it is good for.

    contains a summary to serve as recall. Moving back and forth between chapters
    until information sticks can be useful in aiding understanding.

- en: The recommended approach to the book is to follow along and write the code as
    it’s being explained instead of reading passively. This way you will get the most
    of it. All of the source code is available for download from [https://github.com/bor0/racket-coin](https://github.com/bor0/racket-coin)
