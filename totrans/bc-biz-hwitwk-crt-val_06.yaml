    to be an authority, a Governor, who can frame rules, implement them and monitor
    each system. The present scenario has been dictated by a centralized scheme of
    governance. The scheme has its own flaws. There is a lack of trust and transparency,
    delayed processing, and complexity involved in the whole system. Hence, the wave
    is transitioning towards decentralized governance and it may become the modus
    operandi in the near future. A decentralized control structure makes the system
    more versatile and trustworthy by eliminating several unwanted middle authorities
    as well as removing the single locus of control. Blockchain has emerged as a powerful
    tool and can serve as a building block for realizing the implementation and benefits
    of decentralized governance. In this piece of work, we attempt to highlight the
    advantages that the blockchain infrastructure can reap in, ventures wherein blockchains
    have been utilized to bring about improvements from the current centralized implementations
    and finally the challenges that need to be catered to before we can fully switch
    to a decentralized model of governance.

    the power of blockchain technology. Governance may be undertaken by distinct entities:
    a central government, a market or, a network. It is the way rules, norms or guidelines
    are designed, implemented, maintained, regulated, and held accountable [1, 2].
    Through governance, one can bring a proper system into the way the society transacts,
    to establish the methodology of interaction, and to build a cohesive institutional
    framework. Informally, governance relates to the political processes executing
    within an organization and between organizations. Generally, governance is implemented
    in a centralized manner in which there is a single entity, say governing body
    that is endowed with the complete responsibility of maintaining order through
    formulated laws. Its decisions are binding and need to be strictly adhered to

    to imbibe innovations, speedily cope with challenges and to evolve with the changing
    requirements of the society. The majority of the power lies with few individuals
    and if this central locus of power fails, the entire system drowns. There is an

    has paved the way for a decentralized system that can actually be trusted and
    in which the power lies with each participating member. Every entity is held accountable
    for its actions and governed by strict laws in the surveillance of every other
    participant [5]. Blockchain develops on four important features: a distributed
    architecture, trust, immutability, and transparency. Trust is the most important
    attribute sought for in a government and blockchains are a perfect way to provide
    seamless trust through the several cryptographic primitives deployed, digital
    signatures, and through mining. With decentralization, the power is no longer
    in the hands of few but is distributed. This could help the entities involved
    to achieve political equality and transparency. The norms are established and

    of global currency known as cryptocurrency or BitCoin. This currency has gained
    abundant attention due to its advantages such as decentralization, disintermediation,
    anonymity, data security, data integrity, and availability [1]. After the success
    of BitCoin, Blockchain applications are not only applicable to the mere execution
    of a transaction, but are useful in computation of network, banking, healthcare,
    crowd funding, and many others (each field has its own blockchain architecture
    demands) [5]. The fundamental key to the implementation of Blockchain in the respective
    area is smart contract technology. These smart contracts eliminate the need for
    human interaction and lower the risk of manipulation in documents. In simple terms,
    a smart contract is a piece of code that can be written into the blockchain to
    aid the validation or negotiation between two parties. It operates beneath a set
    of predefined conditions that both parties agree to and the conditions of the
    agreement are automatically carried out. There are various platforms available
    that provide smart contracts. The most popular is known as Ethereum, which enables
    a decentralized platform to operate smart contracts. The users who opted for ethereum
    can create their own set of rules and be able to run the applications as written
    by them in the coding [1, 3].

    vested strategic interests in the donor agencies, and limited transparency due
    to information asymmetry. The receiving countries often fail to spend the funds
    in the designated area. Hence, the principal-agent problem is again witnessed
    in which the principal delegates the work of disbursement of aid to an agent who
    can carry out the task effectively but in reality, due to communication gaps or
    hidden selfish motives, the recipient procurement is affected.

    the important “trust” factor when the system involves several participants namely
    governments, international organizations, and NGOs. Mostly the aids are conditional
    i.e. the recipient organizations have to fulfill some necessary obligations before
    their aid is released. With blockchain smart contract implementation, the commitment
    issues can be easily resolved and there is less possibility of any cheating. As
    soon as all the conditions are met, the grant release can be automatically initiated.
    Also, blockchain based prediction markets can help provide authentic real world
    information related to aid relations managed by smart contracts. Hence, there
    is no information asymmetry. Due to the presence of several intermediaries, the
    transaction costs are high in the current system. But with blockchain, the transaction
    costs can be reduced, owing to less dependency on intermediaries. All the transactions
    are traceable, and hence there is no problem of accountability. Also, the accuracy
    and success of the project can be effectively evaluated because there will be
    input from both the donor and the beneficiaries reporting results. But of course,
    such a DAO can only be realized with the support and approval of the governments.

    implementations catering to the need of the hour. Undoubtedly, organizations like
    the United Nations that play an important role in global environmental governance
    have begun to understand the hype of blockchain and consider it as an alternative
    model for governing environment related pacts and treaties. The main reason behind
    this transition is the power of blockchain to provide authentic data that is readily
    accessible; and data is of utmost importance before any strategies in the environmental
    hemisphere can be thought of. There is a generally a lack of open data as expressed
    by environmental activists. But with blockchain, facilitation of data and communication
    is simplified. Several projects have already been initiated and one such noteworthy
    project is Integrated Program for Climate Initiatives (DAO IPCI). The project
    was an initiative of Russian Carbon Fund and implemented by connecting to a nongovernmental
    Carbon registry due to dissatisfaction with governmental registry. An ethereum
    based system was developed with the participants being ones dealing with greenhouse-gas
    credit based and quota-based emissions. Smart contracts were used to simplify
    the trading process, reduce the cost of transactions and undertake processing
    of mitigation units in a transparent manner. The project was in line with the
    business processes devised by Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) keeping in mind environmental
    concerns as well as the international climate regime coming from the Paris Agreement.
    In 2017, the first carbon credit transaction was carried out pioneered by DAO
    IPCI and Aera Group using blockchain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Corporate Governance is another important area where blockchain can play a significant
    role. Corporates are often affected by the agency problem to which there is no
    well-defined solution. The agency problem arises due to a lack of trust between
    a principal and an agent who the principal hires to represent him/her. The agent
    is authorized with the decision making abilities on behalf of the principal. Whenever
    there is a lag in communication between the two entities or the agent makes decisions
    to fulfill his own selfish motives, a conflict situation prevails. Due to the
    nonalignment of trust between the two parties, a residual loss is incurred. Hence,
    the agency costs which include monitoring costs, bonding costs, and residual loss
    actually increase the expenditure for the principal. Blockchain offers a highly
    reliable and secure decentralized network to overcome agency costs. To prevent
    this, the principals have to resort to costly mechanisms to improve information
    flow and to continuously monitor the activities of the agent. Existing universal
    governance solutions are inadequate as the nature of agency conflicts varies across
    firms. There is no such solution that could have a wider reach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain can serve as the savior in such a scenario. The monitoring activity
    can easily be delegated to a decentralized system freeing principals off this
    time consuming and expensive activity. The agency costs can be reduced and a proper
    channel of communication can be established through smart contracts. Blockchains
    guarantee that each transaction is executed as per the rules outlined and in a
    secure manner, hence assuring the integrity of the governance framework. All information
    is validated by the principal and agent and its authenticity is guaranteed by
    digital signatures without compromising privacy. This results in building a zero
    agency cost coordination relationship between the principal and the agent.

    organizations (DAO). This would help establish peer to peer connectivity and collaboration
    without the traditional hierarchical corporate layers. Optimization routines would
    then run at each node to improve the performance of the DAO and implementation
    of value to effort workflows by rewarding the entities bringing in profits. Hence,
    if the required infrastructural resources are made available, then a networked
    decentralized environment can be created without any internal or external monitoring
    mechanisms created for resolving agency problems [22].

    motive to strengthen the decision-making function of the AGM. Due to limited information
    and time, the decisions made in an AGM are generally flawed. Specifically, small
    share-holders do not get to play a vital role in the decision-making process.
    This is attributed to the higher transaction costs of voting. The main problems
    include the chain of intermediaries involved in buying shares and the immense
    costs of cross border participation of shareholders. These problems can be easily
    catered to by deploying a private blockchain facilitated by smart contracts. All
    information is available to all shareholders. As soon as a proposal is added to
    a blockchain, each stakeholder is notified and can exercise his voting power to
    participate in the decision-making process. The entire process would be transparent
    and complete authenticity and representation is guaranteed [23].

    costs incurred while transacting via smart contracts. Inflexibility costs occur
    due to problems while devising the rules to be encoded as smart contracts. Oracle
    costs are a result of inaccurate information provided by agents that lead to inappropriate
    execution of smart contracts. Security costs needed to ensure the security of
    the blockchain framework. But blockchains can definitely impact the costs related
    to monitoring agent interests and other firm operations and lead to unrealized

    provides a viable solution to conceptualize a real world model of decentralized
    governance that is foolproof. The technological backbone of the system needs to
    be strengthened before it can be widely accepted. Services, supply chains, knowledge
    networks etc can then be readily governed through blockchain based infrastructure.
    What is exciting and intriguing is to see whether blockchain can lead to stateless
    governance i.e. a fully fledged decentralized model. This is bound to have repercussions.
    To be able to stand out as a hyper-political tool, all political interactions
    and policy making procedures would have to boil down to social contracts, which
    is totally debatable. Algorithms cannot bring in the human conscience while drafting
    policies and making decisions; though they can provide assistance in these endeavors.
    As of now, it seems they can definitely help decentralize some areas but the concept
    of a society without any central authority and totally based on decentralized
    platforms and distributed consensus needs to be deliberated upon [28].

- en: The term governance has always been symbolic of a single authoritative power,
    an administrator that controls the management of events, entities, services, trades,
    etc. Centralized mode of governance has been the norm since centuries and any
    effort towards shifting to decentralization or distribution of power in multiple
    hands has been thwarted with the lack of a supportive plan of effective implementation.
    In this work, a brief discussion on the usage of the new generation blockchain
    technology for governance has been presented. The decentralization property of
    blockchain offers a new approach for governance where centralized control is distributed
    to multiple entities. This offers several advantages over the conventional centralized
    system. The chapter begins with a comprehensive account of the issues in the centralized
    mode and how a decentralized architecture can help overcome them. The principles
    and properties incumbent of blockchain that make it a feasible technology for
    conceiving the fruits of decentralization have also been detailed. Next, a number
    of use cases where blockchain has been used for governance have been explored.
    The areas where blockchain technology can play a vital role in making the governance
    more robust has been presented from the research projects undertaken. These include
    deployment of blockchain for managing public services, sharing and communicating
    knowledge via blockchain, an evenly regulated supply chain system, proper utilization
    of foreign aid, maintaining environmental values through environmental governance,
    resolving issues like the agency problem in corporate governance and finally economic
    governance. Finally, the advantages, challenges and scope of this marvel technology
    have been discussed for it to be fully utilized in building a completely decentralized
    model for governance.
