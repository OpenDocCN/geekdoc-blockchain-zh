- en: Every systematic organization abides by laws, even the universe. There needs
    to be an authority, a Governor, who can frame rules, implement them and monitor
    each system. The present scenario has been dictated by a centralized scheme of
    governance. The scheme has its own flaws. There is a lack of trust and transparency,
    delayed processing, and complexity involved in the whole system. Hence, the wave
    is transitioning towards decentralized governance and it may become the modus
    operandi in the near future. A decentralized control structure makes the system
    more versatile and trustworthy by eliminating several unwanted middle authorities
    as well as removing the single locus of control. Blockchain has emerged as a powerful
    tool and can serve as a building block for realizing the implementation and benefits
    of decentralized governance. In this piece of work, we attempt to highlight the
    advantages that the blockchain infrastructure can reap in, ventures wherein blockchains
    have been utilized to bring about improvements from the current centralized implementations
    and finally the challenges that need to be catered to before we can fully switch
    to a decentralized model of governance.

    the power of blockchain technology. Governance may be undertaken by distinct entities:
    a central government, a market or, a network. It is the way rules, norms or guidelines
    are designed, implemented, maintained, regulated, and held accountable [1, 2].
    Through governance, one can bring a proper system into the way the society transacts,
    to establish the methodology of interaction, and to build a cohesive institutional
    framework. Informally, governance relates to the political processes executing
    within an organization and between organizations. Generally, governance is implemented
    in a centralized manner in which there is a single entity, say governing body
    that is endowed with the complete responsibility of maintaining order through
    formulated laws. Its decisions are binding and need to be strictly adhered to

    governing body，承担通过制定的法律维护秩序的全部责任。其决定是具有约束力的，需要严格遵守[3]。

    The structure involves hierarchy and top-down coordination. Often there is a lag
    in this which results in slowing down the basic processes. This results in incompetency
    to imbibe innovations, speedily cope with challenges and to evolve with the changing
    requirements of the society. The majority of the power lies with few individuals
    and if this central locus of power fails, the entire system drowns. There is an
    inevitable need for complete trust on the entities higher up and this backbone
    is split into pieces if there is evidence of corruption [4].

    [5]。区块链基于四个重要特性发展：分布式架构、信任、不可篡改性和透明性。信任是政府寻求的最重要属性，而区块链通过部署多种密码学原语、数字签名以及挖矿等方式，提供无缝的信任机制。通过去中心化，权力不再集中在少数人手中，而是分散开来。这有助于参与实体实现政治平等和透明度。规范由每位成员建立和监督，从而减少了腐败或伪造的机会。借助不可篡改性和授权，减少了分歧的可能性

    abundant attention due to its advantages such as decentralization, disintermediation,
    anonymity, data security, data integrity, and availability [1]. After the success

    of a transaction, but are useful in computation of network, banking, healthcare,
    crowd funding, and many others (each field has its own blockchain architecture
    demands) [5]. The fundamental key to the implementation of Blockchain in the respective
    area is smart contract technology. These smart contracts eliminate the need for
    human interaction and lower the risk of manipulation in documents. In simple terms,
    a smart contract is a piece of code that can be written into the blockchain to
    aid the validation or negotiation between two parties. It operates beneath a set
    of predefined conditions that both parties agree to and the conditions of the
    agreement are automatically carried out. There are various platforms available
    that provide smart contracts. The most popular is known as Ethereum, which enables
    a decentralized platform to operate smart contracts. The users who opted for ethereum
    can create their own set of rules and be able to run the applications as written
    by them in the coding [1, 3].

  zh: 6.4.6 公司治理
- en: Corporate Governance is another important area where blockchain can play a significant
    role. Corporates are often affected by the agency problem to which there is no
    well-defined solution. The agency problem arises due to a lack of trust between
    a principal and an agent who the principal hires to represent him/her. The agent
    is authorized with the decision making abilities on behalf of the principal. Whenever
    there is a lag in communication between the two entities or the agent makes decisions
    to fulfill his own selfish motives, a conflict situation prevails. Due to the
    nonalignment of trust between the two parties, a residual loss is incurred. Hence,
    the agency costs which include monitoring costs, bonding costs, and residual loss
    actually increase the expenditure for the principal. Blockchain offers a highly
    reliable and secure decentralized network to overcome agency costs. To prevent
    this, the principals have to resort to costly mechanisms to improve information
    flow and to continuously monitor the activities of the agent. Existing universal
    governance solutions are inadequate as the nature of agency conflicts varies across
    firms. There is no such solution that could have a wider reach.

  zh: 公司治理是区块链可以发挥重要作用的另一个重要领域。公司通常受到代理问题的影响，对此没有明确的解决方案。代理问题源于主体和代理之间的信任缺失，主体雇佣代理来代表他/她。代理被授权为主体做出决策。无论是在两者之间的沟通出现滞后，还是代理为了实现自己的自私动机而做出决策，都会出现冲突情况。由于两方之间的信任不对齐，会产生剩余损失。因此，包括监控成本、担保成本和剩余损失在内的代理成本实际上增加了主体的支出。区块链提供了一个高度可靠和安全的去中心化网络，以克服代理成本。为了防止这种情况，主体必须诉诸于昂贵的机制来改善信息流通，并持续监控代理的活动。现有的普遍治理解决方案是不充分的，因为代理冲突的性质在不同公司之间各不相同。没有这样的解决方案能够具有更广泛的影响力。
- en: Blockchain can serve as the savior in such a scenario. The monitoring activity
    can easily be delegated to a decentralized system freeing principals off this
    time consuming and expensive activity. The agency costs can be reduced and a proper
    channel of communication can be established through smart contracts. Blockchains
    guarantee that each transaction is executed as per the rules outlined and in a
    secure manner, hence assuring the integrity of the governance framework. All information
    is validated by the principal and agent and its authenticity is guaranteed by
    digital signatures without compromising privacy. This results in building a zero
    agency cost coordination relationship between the principal and the agent.

- en: An agent-less system is also proposed on the lines of the decentralized autonomous
    organizations (DAO). This would help establish peer to peer connectivity and collaboration
    without the traditional hierarchical corporate layers. Optimization routines would
    then run at each node to improve the performance of the DAO and implementation
    of value to effort workflows by rewarding the entities bringing in profits. Hence,
    if the required infrastructural resources are made available, then a networked
    decentralized environment can be created without any internal or external monitoring
    mechanisms created for resolving agency problems [22].

- en: A blockchain model for the Annual General Meeting (AGM) was proposed with a
    motive to strengthen the decision-making function of the AGM. Due to limited information
    and time, the decisions made in an AGM are generally flawed. Specifically, small
    share-holders do not get to play a vital role in the decision-making process.
    This is attributed to the higher transaction costs of voting. The main problems
    include the chain of intermediaries involved in buying shares and the immense
    costs of cross border participation of shareholders. These problems can be easily
    catered to by deploying a private blockchain facilitated by smart contracts. All
    information is available to all shareholders. As soon as a proposal is added to
    a blockchain, each stakeholder is notified and can exercise his voting power to
    participate in the decision-making process. The entire process would be transparent
    and complete authenticity and representation is guaranteed [23].

    effort towards shifting to decentralization or distribution of power in multiple

    technology for governance has been presented. The decentralization property of
    blockchain offers a new approach for governance where centralized control is distributed
    to multiple entities. This offers several advantages over the conventional centralized
    system. The chapter begins with a comprehensive account of the issues in the centralized
    mode and how a decentralized architecture can help overcome them. The principles
    and properties incumbent of blockchain that make it a feasible technology for
    conceiving the fruits of decentralization have also been detailed. Next, a number
    of use cases where blockchain has been used for governance have been explored.
    The areas where blockchain technology can play a vital role in making the governance
    more robust has been presented from the research projects undertaken. These include
    deployment of blockchain for managing public services, sharing and communicating
    knowledge via blockchain, an evenly regulated supply chain system, proper utilization
    of foreign aid, maintaining environmental values through environmental governance,
    resolving issues like the agency problem in corporate governance and finally economic
    governance. Finally, the advantages, challenges and scope of this marvel technology
    have been discussed for it to be fully utilized in building a completely decentralized
    model for governance.

  zh: 治理这一术语历来是单一权威权力的象征，是一个管理事件、实体、服务、贸易等的管理者。几个世纪以来，集中式治理一直是标准，任何向去中心化或权力分散的努力都因缺乏有效的实施计划而受挫。在这项工作中，对新一代区块链技术在治理中的使用的简要讨论已经呈现。区块链的去中心化属性为治理提供了一种新方法，其中集中式控制被分配到多个实体。这比传统的集中式系统有几个优点。章节从对集中式模式的问题的全面描述开始，以及如何通过去中心化架构来克服它们。也详细介绍了使区块链成为实现去中心化成果的切实可行技术的原理和属性。接下来，探索了区块链已在治理中使用的几个用例。从开展的研究项目中介绍了区块链技术可以在哪些领域发挥关键作用，使治理更加健壮。这些包括通过区块链管理公共服务，通过区块链分享和交流知识，均衡的供应链体系，外国援助的适当利用，通过环境治理维护环境价值，解决公司治理中的代理问题，以及最后的经济治理。最后，讨论了这一神奇技术的优势、挑战和发展前景，以便充分利用它来构建一个完全去中心化的治理模型。
