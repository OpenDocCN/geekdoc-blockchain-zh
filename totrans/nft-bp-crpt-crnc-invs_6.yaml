    you can buy and sell NFT, they are stored in a digital wallet - similar to what
    is known from cryptocurrencies. With the right feeling you can make real money
    with it: The initially free CryptoPunks, actually only pixelated portraits to
    collect, currently go for the equivalent of around 50,000, - € over the virtual
    counter. You don''t have to sell NFT as unique pieces, for each work you can create
    any number of tokens - with a corresponding effect on the market value, of course.'

    as MP3, GIF or PNG, pay a small fee (in the form of a cryptocurrency) and can
    then store your NFT in the wallet. Because the tokens are then part of the blockchain,
    you don't have to sell them on the same platform where you created them. There
    is no obligation to sell at all, anyone can become a collector of their own works
    of art with NFT.

    developers. There are platforms that make it possible to perform the transaction
    easily so that users do not choke on the technical world of blockchain. All you
    need to produce NFT is a digital cryptocurrency wallet. After uploading the file
    to be produced as NFT to the IPFS system through these platforms, the parameters
    of the NFT that cannot be changed are determined. After determining how many NFTs
    will be produced, its price, how much share will have to be paid on its next sale,
    NFT is produced by paying the transaction fee of the blockchain network. Upon
    completion of the transaction, NFT's are transferred to the cryptocurrency wallet
    and recorded on the entire blockchain where the production is carried out.

- en: NFT's are different from other cryptocurrencies by design and their value is
    determined by the person or investor who produces the work rather than the checkboard.
    If the subject of investment is interpreted through digital art, it is not so
    different from investing in physical art. Similarly, parameters such as how rare
    that asset is, age and cosmetics determine the value of an asset purchased as
    a collection piece.

- en: '"Non-Fungible Token" means digital asset (token) that cannot be divided and
    can never be produced again. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, which
    are "fungibles", NFT''s are unique digital assets. To illustrate with an example,
    today you can buy and buy Bitcoin or Ether by breaking it into pieces and exchange
    the same cryptocurrency in its own unit. However, NFT, a private digital entity,
    cannot be traded with another token because it is unique. Its internal value is
    determined by its manufacturer or investor.'

    是一个私人数字实体，不能用另一个代币交易，因为它是独一无二的。它的内在价值由其制造者或投资者决定。

    like Bitcoin, is one of the cryptocurrencies and offers space in its blockchain
    for additional information on which NFT depends. Theoretically, however, other
    blockchains can also be used for NFT. At the cryptocurrency Tron, corresponding
    tokens with the TRC-721 standard were already presented in December last year
    – probably also in response to the boom of ERC-721, the Ethereum protocol for
    NFT.

    NFT。在加密货币 Tron 上，与 TRC-721 标准相对应的代币在去年十二月就已经推出了 - 这可能也是对以太坊协议 ERC-721 暴涨的回应。

    fact the associated digitization of the art market opens a few rusty doors. On
    the one hand, more and more works of art are being created in virtual space, be
    they memes, graphics or objects in computer games. NFT allows a clear determination
    of ownership claims and enables new models of monetization. At the same time,
    the art market has a general demand problem and the hype is just right: When Beeple''s
    69-million-dollar work was sold, for example, almost exclusively new customers
    were in the auction house.'

  zh: 艺术行业中的一些人已经把NFT视为一个改变游戏规则的因素，实际上与之相关的艺术市场数字化打开了一些生锈的门。一方面，越来越多的艺术作品在虚拟空间中创建，无论是迷因、图形还是电脑游戏中的物体。NFT允许明确确定所有权声明，并实现新的货币化模式。与此同时，艺术市场存在普遍的需求问题，炒作恰到好处：例如，当Beeple的价值6,900万美元的作品售出时，几乎完全是新客户在拍卖行里。
- en: 'NFT also opens up new investment opportunities in art objects. Owners can sell
    percentage shares in works via NFT without having to give up their own ownership.
    Museums could also develop new forms of financing: shares in works by great artists
    could be sold proportionately with NFT, while the affected object remains in place.
    Owners can also use NFT to set royalties for their digital works and then receive
    a share of the sale price each time they resell.'

  zh: NFT会有什么影响？
- en: Considering the current uses of NFT, it can be said that it solves intellectual
    property problems first. While it is very easy to copy a work digitally; The NFT
    solves this problem by revealing who owns the rights to the work. Because they
    are a programmable digital asset, artists' share of the next sale can also be
    encoded inside the NFT. Thus, in the event of a sale, the relevant amount is automatically
    transferred to the artist's wallet. The digital nature of the NFTs allow users
    of all types to buy them from all over the world. As the customer base expands
    thanks to digitalization, the number of people who can reach the work and want
    to invest, and therefore the demand increases, as demand increases, the price
    rises. As demand increases, so does supply. More NFTs at different price levels
    are coming to market. This increases accessibility for investors and art lovers
    and expands the ecosystem by enabling more works to be sold.

  zh: 考虑到NFT目前的用途，可以说它首先解决了知识产权问题。虽然数字作品很容易被复制；但NFT通过揭示谁拥有作品的权利来解决了这个问题。因为它们是可编程的数字资产，艺术家在下一次销售中的份额也可以编码在NFT内。因此，在销售发生时，相关金额会自动转移到艺术家的钱包。NFT的数字化特性使得所有类型的用户都可以从世界各地购买它们。随着数字化带来的客户群的扩大，能够接触到作品并希望投资的人数也增加了，因此需求增加，价格上涨。需求增加，供应也增加。更多不同价格水平的NFT正在进入市场。这增加了投资者和艺术爱好者的可访问性，并通过使更多作品出售来扩大生态系统。

    easily copied by anyone. Even if the owner, copyright or the uniqueness of such
    files are documented and proven by NFT, this can be done with a simple right click.
    However, NFT gives the owner something that cannot be copied: the ownership and
    all associated claims to the digital work. As a practical example: Anyone can
    order an art print of the Mona Lisa or put it on a copier at home, but the original
    still hangs only once in the Louvre in Paris.'

    who produce NFT and want to put it up for sale go through a stream of verified
    profiles used by NFT marketplace apps to prove that their work is original. If
    you have the information of the wallet address of the artist concerned, which
    is shared publicly for the purpose of receiving payment, you have the chance to
    confirm the originality of the work. In addition, by tracking the movements of
    the NFT from the blockchain monitoring application, the authenticity of both the
    artist and his works can be ensured.

    is virtually impossible. This is ensured by the Ethereum blockchain. Information
    about buyers and sellers or the date of purchase are stored transparently for
    each transaction in the blockchain, comparable to the documentation in the account
    management. Owners, uniqueness and authenticity are thus virtually set in stone.
    In order to fraudulently manipulate part of the blockchain, an evildoer would
    have to hold at least 51% of the computing power in the mining network. In the
    industry, this scenario is considered quite a super-GAU, but the practical risk
    for it is minimal.

    51% 的计算能力。在行业中，这种情况被认为是相当严重的灾难，但它的实际风险很小。
