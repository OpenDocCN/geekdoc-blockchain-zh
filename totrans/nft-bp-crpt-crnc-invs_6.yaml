    you can buy and sell NFT, they are stored in a digital wallet - similar to what
    is known from cryptocurrencies. With the right feeling you can make real money
    with it: The initially free CryptoPunks, actually only pixelated portraits to
    collect, currently go for the equivalent of around 50,000, - € over the virtual
    counter. You don''t have to sell NFT as unique pieces, for each work you can create
    any number of tokens - with a corresponding effect on the market value, of course.'

    digital work and find a customer. On a trading platform, you upload files such
    as MP3, GIF or PNG, pay a small fee (in the form of a cryptocurrency) and can
    then store your NFT in the wallet. Because the tokens are then part of the blockchain,
    you don't have to sell them on the same platform where you created them. There
    is no obligation to sell at all, anyone can become a collector of their own works
    of art with NFT.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NFT's are manufactured according to the ERC-721 token standard prepared by Ethereum
    developers. There are platforms that make it possible to perform the transaction
    easily so that users do not choke on the technical world of blockchain. All you
    need to produce NFT is a digital cryptocurrency wallet. After uploading the file
    to be produced as NFT to the IPFS system through these platforms, the parameters
    of the NFT that cannot be changed are determined. After determining how many NFTs
    will be produced, its price, how much share will have to be paid on its next sale,
    NFT is produced by paying the transaction fee of the blockchain network. Upon
    completion of the transaction, NFT's are transferred to the cryptocurrency wallet
    and recorded on the entire blockchain where the production is carried out.

    determined by the person or investor who produces the work rather than the checkboard.
    If the subject of investment is interpreted through digital art, it is not so
    different from investing in physical art. Similarly, parameters such as how rare
    that asset is, age and cosmetics determine the value of an asset purchased as
    a collection piece.

- en: '"Non-Fungible Token" means digital asset (token) that cannot be divided and
    can never be produced again. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, which
    are "fungibles", NFT''s are unique digital assets. To illustrate with an example,
    today you can buy and buy Bitcoin or Ether by breaking it into pieces and exchange
    the same cryptocurrency in its own unit. However, NFT, a private digital entity,
    cannot be traded with another token because it is unique. Its internal value is
    determined by its manufacturer or investor.'

    like Bitcoin, is one of the cryptocurrencies and offers space in its blockchain
    for additional information on which NFT depends. Theoretically, however, other
    blockchains can also be used for NFT. At the cryptocurrency Tron, corresponding
    tokens with the TRC-721 standard were already presented in December last year
    – probably also in response to the boom of ERC-721, the Ethereum protocol for
    NFT.

    fact the associated digitization of the art market opens a few rusty doors. On
    the one hand, more and more works of art are being created in virtual space, be
    they memes, graphics or objects in computer games. NFT allows a clear determination
    of ownership claims and enables new models of monetization. At the same time,
    the art market has a general demand problem and the hype is just right: When Beeple''s
    69-million-dollar work was sold, for example, almost exclusively new customers
    were in the auction house.'

    percentage shares in works via NFT without having to give up their own ownership.
    Museums could also develop new forms of financing: shares in works by great artists
    could be sold proportionately with NFT, while the affected object remains in place.
    Owners can also use NFT to set royalties for their digital works and then receive
    a share of the sale price each time they resell.'

- en: Considering the current uses of NFT, it can be said that it solves intellectual
    property problems first. While it is very easy to copy a work digitally; The NFT
    solves this problem by revealing who owns the rights to the work. Because they
    are a programmable digital asset, artists' share of the next sale can also be
    encoded inside the NFT. Thus, in the event of a sale, the relevant amount is automatically
    transferred to the artist's wallet. The digital nature of the NFTs allow users
    of all types to buy them from all over the world. As the customer base expands
    thanks to digitalization, the number of people who can reach the work and want
    to invest, and therefore the demand increases, as demand increases, the price
    rises. As demand increases, so does supply. More NFTs at different price levels
    are coming to market. This increases accessibility for investors and art lovers
    and expands the ecosystem by enabling more works to be sold.

    easily copied by anyone. Even if the owner, copyright or the uniqueness of such
    files are documented and proven by NFT, this can be done with a simple right click.
    However, NFT gives the owner something that cannot be copied: the ownership and
    all associated claims to the digital work. As a practical example: Anyone can
    order an art print of the Mona Lisa or put it on a copier at home, but the original
    still hangs only once in the Louvre in Paris.'

    who produce NFT and want to put it up for sale go through a stream of verified
    profiles used by NFT marketplace apps to prove that their work is original. If
    you have the information of the wallet address of the artist concerned, which
    is shared publicly for the purpose of receiving payment, you have the chance to
    confirm the originality of the work. In addition, by tracking the movements of
    the NFT from the blockchain monitoring application, the authenticity of both the
    artist and his works can be ensured.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes and no. With NFT, simple "piracy", just like with common cryptocurrencies,
    is virtually impossible. This is ensured by the Ethereum blockchain. Information
    about buyers and sellers or the date of purchase are stored transparently for
    each transaction in the blockchain, comparable to the documentation in the account
    management. Owners, uniqueness and authenticity are thus virtually set in stone.
    In order to fraudulently manipulate part of the blockchain, an evildoer would
    have to hold at least 51% of the computing power in the mining network. In the
    industry, this scenario is considered quite a super-GAU, but the practical risk
    for it is minimal.

    and Co., opinions at NFT differ widely. Some consider the tokens to be an unavoidable
    revolution in the art industry, for others it is at best a gimmick with enormous
    loss potential. Although you can''t hang NFT on the wall, the tokens have often
    been sold for horrendous sums: Jack Dorsey''s first tweet brought in $2.5 million,
    a collection by Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland changed hands for $2.3 million,
    and "Disaster Girl" Zoë Roth sold an NFT of her memes for at least $500,000.'

    retails for $77,000\. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey''s tweet was bought by a Turkish-born

    this is currently particularly large due to the hype about NFT. This attracts
    speculators and collectors. In addition, digital art is certainly a powerful future
    market, so NFT will certainly shake up some in the art industry. Of course, this
    is not a guarantee for quick wealth, even with NFT bubbles can form and high losses
    arise - but also huge profits.

    dilemma of many cryptocurrencies: more than 80 kilowatt hours of electricity are
    consumed per transaction and thus around 33 kilograms of CO2 are emitted. However,
    there is hope in sight: The resource-consuming consensus procedure "Proof of Work"
    (PoW) is to be replaced by "Proof of Stake" (PoS) before the end of this year.
    This not only expects a significant reduction in energy consumption, but also
    increases the transaction speed: from currently about 15 processes per second
    to several thousand.'

    If digital art is sustainable, then it is probably also NFT. Theoretically, many
    other areas of application are also possible. In addition to the function as a
    certificate of authenticity, the tokens are also conceivable as forgery-proof
    tickets for events from concerts to adventure pools. Even non-digital objects
    could one day be verified, and they are also applicable to people: for example,
    for identification with authorities or offices.'

    crypto art. The focus is on the trade in high-priced premium articles as well

    are being constructed. First, the digitization of physical assets, i.e., 'tokenization',
    can be adapted to a wide range of sectors. Last week, for example, a 3D virtual
    world-designed home in the U.S. sold for $500,000\. It also appears that some
    games also have land sales as NFT. Another area where NFT is expected to have
    an impact is social media. Metrics such as the number of follow-ups, views and
    views that creator’s cash in have the potential to be rendered non-manipulated
    by centralized social media companies thanks to NFTs. Digitization of physical
    assets seems to cause us to redesign many of the processes we are accustomed to.
    There are even scenarios in which NFTs future uses include governments producing
    their bonds as NFT and being able to trade them globally.
