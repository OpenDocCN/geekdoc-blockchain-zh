  zh: 1 简介
- en: The IoT has gained much interest recently due to its ability to connect many
    real-world objects. It can play a vital role in many domains to improve the quality
    of life in different areas such as smart homes, medical health, education, industry,
    agriculture, transports, and smart cities. Now there is a paradigm shift towards
    the concept of “anytime, anywhere, anyone, connected to anything.” In many areas,
    whether it is our homes or workplace, the devices are becoming essential for our
    daily lifestyle. IoT has made it possible to connect everyone with everything
    in the environment [[1](#CR1)]. Connecting different devices and adding sensors
    enhance a level of intelligence to devices, otherwise they would be dumb, making
    them transfer up-to-date data without any human involvement. The organization
    of the chapter is shown in Fig. [6.1](#Fig1).![../images/501059_1_En_6_Chapter/501059_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_6_Chapter/501059_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png)

    of China, the scientists have come up with patrol robots using the technologies
    such as 5G, edge computing, and cloud computing [[46](#CR46)]. As the primary
    symptom of the disease is high temperature. Hence the robots are armed with the
    high-resolution cameras (a total of five cameras) and infrared red thermometer
    capable of measuring the temperature of the ten peoples simultaneously within
    a radius of 5–6 m. Doing these things physically/manually will lead to potential
    health threats and public safety will be exposed. If the conditions such as high
    temperature and a person without the mask are identified, then the robot will
    send the alert to the concerned authorities (the central control system for making
    a real-time decision based on the responses). These robots can be handled through
    remotes and are self-driven and reduce the need for manpower and patrolling responsibilities
    too. The same is depicted in Fig. [7.4](#Fig4). There are various demands of such
    5G based robots in every corner of the world and have already been spotted in
    areas such as shopping malls and airports. The technologies that these 5G robots
    will use are Big data, Cloud Computing, edge computing, AI, and IoT. By combining
    these aforementioned technologies, the robots can sense, do autonomous motion
    control, dynamic decision-making, and can do behavioral penetration and sensing.
    To take action at run time the 5G patrol robots are power-driven by industrial
    edge computing (high performance-MIC-770 and is equipped with eighth Generation
    Intel Core i and aimed at IoT applications using GPU iModule i.e. MIC-75G20).
    The industrial-grade edge computer combined with MIC-75G20 GPU iModule delivers
    a high-performance system for AI inference and training. Its cast aluminum heatsink
    and ruggedized chassis protect against shock and vibration, the passive thermal
    solution ensures silent setup.![../images/501059_1_En_7_Chapter/501059_1_En_7_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_7_Chapter/501059_1_En_7_Fig4_HTML.png)

    dramatic changes and has attracted a great deal of attention to IoT-based industry
    automation with the advent and application of modern technologies such as digital
    twin, cloud computing, big data, edge and service-oriented technology, and advanced
    sensing technology [[2](#CR2)]. At the same time, the world has advanced industrial
    production methods such as Industry 4.0, Health 4.0, Education 4.0, cloud manufacturing,
    and Internet + manufacturing, and national strategic manufacturing ideas in many
    countries, such as Made in China 2025, the US manufacturing strategic plan, and
    the transition to a digital economy in Uzbekistan are being promoted. The overall
    goal is to automate the industry through advanced digital production methods.

    the production process inwardly cyber environments and physical environments based
    on modern technologies of data perception and their transmission [[2](#CR2), [21](#CR21)].
    Of course, such processes require the use of IoT systems in industrial automation
    and a network capable of transmitting large amounts of data quickly. Different
    IoT systems use many wireless technologies such as 2/3/4G mobile network, Wi-Fi,

    [[2](#CR2), [21](#CR21)]。当然，这些过程需要在工业自动化中使用物联网系统和能够快速传输大量数据的网络。不同的物联网系统使用许多无线技术，如2/3/4G移动网络，Wi-Fi，WiMAX等，成千上万的设备通过这些智能无线技术连接到彼此
    [[16](#CR16)]。
- en: 2G mobile networks (covering 90% of society overworld) are intended to voice
    communication, 3G mobile networks (currently covering 65% of society overworld)
    to data and voice, and 4G mobile networks to high-speed rate Internet communication.
    3G and 4G mobile network have significantly increased capabilities that ensure
    Internet access to the IoT device. The available 3G and 4G mobile networks are
    the most effective communication technologies of IoT, offering IoT application
    designed for industrial automation with a comprehensive, high level of security,
    low cost, efficient access to the allocated spectrum, and simplicity of management.
    Also, 4G “long-term evolution” (LTE) has become the quickest and most tenable
    type of network technology relatively to popular technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE,
    WiMAX, LoRa, Sigfox, ZigBee, and others [[1](#CR1), [28](#CR28), [47](#CR47)].
    However, existing mobile networks do not support MTC (Machine-Type Communication),
    which are the basis of IoT, and are not fully optimized for such systems [[16](#CR16),
    [17](#CR17)]. Emerging 5G networks provide a potential solution in this case.
    5G provides fast mobile network data transfer in the shortest possible time and
    offers improved coverage for MTC connectivity without negating the current 4G
    (LTE) network based on IoT requirements. As next-generation communication network,
    5G is supposed to address issues that arise in 3G and 4G networks, such as in
    smart management application (smart city, smart home, smart transportation) or
    more complex communication, intelligence, and large-scale data processing, which
    is important for IoT systems designed for industrial automation [[10](#CR10)].
    The development of 5G is created via 4G LTE-based system, which provides voice
    and data transmission to users and provides them with a fast connection to the
    Internet. The 5G network provides reliable and fast connectivity and significantly
    increases data transfer speeds for IoT applications designed for industrial automation.
    The current 4G LTE network can provide speeds up to 1 GB/s, but the 4G signal
    can be easily extinguished due to buildings, Wi-Fi signals, microwave signals,
    and other wave interference [[16](#CR16)]. 5G networks provide users with higher
    data speeds up to 10 Gb/s than 4G networks; moreover, the network itself provides
    reliable connectivity to thousands of devices [[16](#CR16), [17](#CR17)].

    LTE的系统创建的，该系统向用户提供语音和数据传输，并为他们提供快速的互联网连接。5G网络提供可靠和快速的连接，并显著提高了用于工业自动化的物联网应用的数据传输速度。目前的4G
    LTE网络可以提供高达1 GB/s的速度，但4G信号可能因建筑物、Wi-Fi信号、微波信号和其他波干扰而轻易熄灭。5G网络为用户提供比4G网络高达10 Gb/s的更高数据速度；此外，网络本身为数千个设备提供可靠的连接。

    energy management. Although the security architectures currently used in mobile
    networks and general IoT systems meet the requirements, they are largely centralized
    [[18](#CR18), [22](#CR22)]. The use of such centralized security solutions for
    5G and 5G-enabled IoT applications leads to various barriers, such as genetic
    heterogeneity, complex and static security management procedures, overuse of network
    resources, cost overruns due to network failure increase, etc. Thus, the continued

    production pointers on the shop-floor. It is known that automation technology
    is widely used in shop-floor production, so it is necessary to build large-scale
    automatic production lines in this. On the one hand, the production process of
    a component or product includes several sub-processes, and various production
    types of equipment on the production line perform various processing tasks. On
    the other hand, a single robot with limited machining functions and structure
    is usually unable to perform complex machining tasks such as double mounting or
    performing multiple functions at the same time. In addition, in a high-intensity
    environment, some manufacturing processes require remote control of the functions
    of a large number of robots to perform a specific production task. This manufacturing
    process requires a very precise transmission and a very low latency for two-direction
    data transmission and instruction control between the control center and the shop-floor
    equipment. However, it is very difficult for 3G/4G networks to meet low-latency
    and high-reliability requirements of industrial automation [[29](#CR29)].

  zh: 应用 CPMS 生产模式的常规过程是在车间生产不同的生产指标。众所周知，自动化技术广泛应用于车间生产，因此有必要在此建立大型自动化生产线。一方面，零件或产品的生产过程包括多个子过程，生产线上的各种类型的设备执行各种加工任务。另一方面，一个单一的机器人由于其有限的加工功能和结构通常无法执行复杂的加工任务，例如双重安装或同时执行多个功能。此外，在高强度环境中，一些制造过程需要远程控制大量机器人的功能以执行特定的生产任务。这种制造过程需要非常精确的传输和非常低的延迟，以实现控制中心和车间设备之间的双向数据传输和指令控制。然而，3G/4G
    网络很难满足工业自动化的低延迟和高可靠性要求。
- en: Another common way to use the CPMS mode is through a human-machine interaction.
    Some production processes do not have the flexibility feature in some machines,
    so it is hard to satisfy the requirements of various production operations. In
    other production processes, due to the need for manual handling of non-ergonomic
    tasks, workers have to load heavy workloads. With the machine performing specific
    tasks and the flexibility of the person, the machine can quickly adjust the operating
    mode according to the instructions given by the workers by pressing a button,
    body movement, or sound. Besides, when workers enter the range of motion of the
    machine, the machine (e.g., robot, machine tool) should slow down, and if necessary,
    the machines have to stop tracking to ensure worker safety. The production model
    produced by human-machine cooperation not only increases productivity but also
    makes the production system more strong and adjustable. However, low-latency and
    very-high-reliability communication technologies are required to ensure safe and

  zh: 应用 CPMS 模式的另一种常见方式是通过人机交互。一些生产过程中的一些机器没有灵活性功能，因此很难满足各种生产操作的要求。在其他生产过程中，由于需要手动处理非人体工学任务，工人不得不承担沉重的工作量。通过机器执行特定任务和人的灵活性，机器可以根据工人的指示通过按按钮、身体移动或声音快速调整操作模式。此外，当工人进入机器的运动范围时，机器（例如机器人、机床）应该减速，并且在必要时，机器必须停止跟踪以确保工人安全。人机合作生产模式不仅提高了生产效率，还使生产系统更加强大和可调整。然而，需要低延迟和非常高可靠性的通信技术来确保人与机器之间的安全高效合作。
- en: A variety of AGVs are used on smart shop-floor and warehouse. The AGV not only
    works jointly with the manipulator and different things for loading and unloading
    goods but also cooperates with other AGVs and can automatically find a power source
    for self-charging. In this case, the AGV determines the location of objects in
    the environment, the condition of other AGVs, the value of battery level, etc.,
    and makes decisions by performing computing quickly. While AGV performs such tasks
    intelligently, it requires a communication network to transmit the data collected
    from them to the data center or to receive control information. Therefore, high-reliability
    and low-latency communication technologies are required for AGV. To implement
    the above three advanced manufacturing processes, a large number of small antenna
    matrices operating on the basis of SDMA can realize flexible strong directional
    electro signal transmission and optimize efficiency in a particular direction.
    To improve communication quality and reduce channel interference, the antenna
    matrix uses multi-signal technology, thereby increasing the reliability of transmission.
    In addition, 5G mobile network architecture is slowly shifting from a centralized
    base station form to a centralized user mode, and the base network resources are

- en: In industrial automation, there are concepts of virtual/augmented reality, and
    more attention is usually paid to the latter. For achieving better production
    results, it is necessary to simulate, analyze, and study the product model before
    completing the project. Therefore, firstly, virtual/augmented reality is used
    in product design. Secondly, in production processes, operational steps and processes
    to increase efficiency and reduce errors can be provided to an employee who assembles
    parts virtually with virtual/augmented reality technologies. Besides, with complexity
    and the high degree of integration of production equipment, its repair and maintenance
    are becoming increasingly complex. With the support of virtual/augmented reality,
    workers can receive real-time maintenance suggestions. But, in production processes
    based on virtual/augmented reality, the data transmitted is in the form of a very
    large amount of media data flow. Therefore, in order to reach a seamless connection
    within virtual/augmented reality, manufacturing, and industrial automation process,
    a new mobile network technology with lower latency and faster transmission speed
    features is required than 3G/4G technology [[29](#CR29)]. The eMBB characteristic
    with high frequency of 5G network provides higher transmission speed and throughput
    than 4G mobile networks to implement the automation of the above two advanced
    industrial production processes. The 28 Ghz and 60 Ghz frequencies in every frequency
    ranges of the mm-wave are the most efficient frequencies of 5G network. The maximum
    bandwidth in a wireless connection is about 5% of the carrier frequency, so it
    is possible to achieve a transfer rate ten times faster than a 4G network connection.
    Furthermore, a 5G network connection based on software-configured network (SDN)
    architecture and C-RAN provides a freely connected management mode between C-Plan
    (communication plan) and D-Plan (data plan), which increases the efficiency of
    intact data transmission [[2](#CR2)].

- en: By adding security features and simplifying service management, blockchains
    are expected to make 5G network services easier. Blockchain is especially effective
    in creating a secure data-sharing or spectrum-transmitting environment on 5G networks.
    Blockchain is seen as a middle layer for performing spectrum trading, checking
    transaction exchanges, and reliably leasing the spectrum provided by spectrum
    source suppliers (license holders). To perform access authentication, unlike traditional
    database management systems that use a centralized server, blockchain can do decentralized
    user access verification applying the computing power of all legitimate participants
    in the network with smart contracts [[30](#CR30)]. This causes the exchange system
    very robust to data changes. Numerous researches on blockchain show that it is
    effective for spectrum management in terms of improved usability with a higher
    level of security, better scalability for blockchain adoption, and an improved
    system of defense against threats and DoS attacks [[31](#CR31)]. In addition,
    with a high level of security on 5G networks, blockchain can simplify network
    virtualization [[32](#CR32)]. Blockchain technology provides the necessary features
    of non-rejection and permanency to overcome the shortcomings of prior centralized
    architecture in virtual networks. Specifically, the blockchain has the ability
    to create secure VWNs (virtual wireless networks), so that resource holders on
    the wireless network can hand over wireless resources (e.g., radiofrequency, infrastructure,
    spectrum layer) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In such decentralized
    virtual networks, smart contracts may be most beneficial to ensure transparency
    and automation in a distributed manner instead of leaning on a special node or
    authorization process, which increases the reliability of resource management
    services. Creating a reliable and fair economic scheme with blockchain may be
    an important solution for managing network interference, particularly in small
    mobile blocks [[8](#CR8)]. Blockchain platforms provide strong data protection
    by entering user data into the ledger. In the ledger, data is signed by hash functions
    and added to blocks. Blockchain has the ability to provide complete control over
    personal data in a network exchange, which is unusual from all traditional approaches
    that prevent users from observing data [[8](#CR8)]. In addition, the blockchain
    may be offering a wide range of security capabilities, such as smart contracts,
    decentralized ledger-based data integrity, and access control through the permission
    process and smart contract authentication.

    are important in almost every industry. All elements need to be enhanced in terms
    of reliability and latency to ensure that significant IoT requirements are met.
    End-to-end latency from a network perspective is the sum of the individual delay
    times of core, transport, and radio networks, and the overall reliability cannot
    be higher than the reliability of the weakest network. Edge computing is necessary
    to minimize transport delays that require critical IoT use cases. Group management,
    real-time mobility, and network monitoring can activate a decentralized management
    unit to optimize latency. It is recommended that the central management unit and
    the main protection are usually located in one place to prevent thrombosis of
    the signal flow. The distribution of the central user part reduces the waiting
    time by keeping user traffic as local as possible and is therefore typically distributed
    in more local areas than the network functions of the control part. Regional full-core

    as any high reliability and low latency typically requires large spectrum sources.
    NR operates at wider frequencies with greater bandwidth and greater capacity than
    LTE, which creates NR selection technology. Due to many factors such as the duration
    of commercial use, the constant expansion of NR URLLC in 3GPP, the acceleration
    of NR, and the ability to update existing LTE aspects with NR, LTE may not improve
    at all for critical IoT. MNOs with a flexible spectrum are in the best position

    key features of different ranges in terms of URLLC size and coverage to appeal

- en: TS 22.104 recommendation of 3GPP described in detail the requirements for cyber-physical
    control applications in vertical areas. The detailed level of this quasi-standard
    should be grounded, i.e., the standardized values for high reliability (between
    99.999% and 99.999999%), latency (0.5–500 ms at different connections), and long-term
    reliability (average failure time between 1 day to 10 years) should ensure the
    widespread use of 5G. This recommendation involves different requirements for
    both periodic and nonperiodic deterministic (or nondeterministic) communication,
    time synchronization, mixed traffic, network operations, and positioning. The
    requirements are also developed on the basis of the types of connections and cover
    the various uses of future industry in enterprises, central power generation,
    power distribution, as well as medical and hospital institutions (in particular
    clear requirements for robotic surgery). In addition, “vehicle-to-everything (V2X)”
    technology in the industry sector is also expected to require a large amount of
    5G network resources, and the relevant requirements for this technology are detailed
    in TS 22.186 recommendation of 3GPP. Likewise, although railway communications
    have critical requirements developed in TS 22.289 recommendation of 3GPP, there
    is little interest by researchers in the specific problems of this transport sector
    [[38](#CR38)]. The requirements and technical capabilities set for 5G technology
    determine that the industry has the full potential for automation. The latest
    recommendation named “Service Requirements for 5G” is illuminated in 3GPP TS 22.261
    recommendation. It outlines 32 types of performance requirements, key capabilities,
    as well as supply and security aspects.

    unlimited storage and computing power, which provides efficient and powerful services
    with minimal control power. Currently, the blockchain has been explored and introduced
    into the cloud computing system to effectively address security issues in 5G networks
    based on cloud. In doing so, the blockchain plays an important role, such as ensuring
    the reliability and security of cloud data in the 5G network. It is used to create
    a verification platform among blockchain, BBU (baseband unit) system, IoT devices,
    and industry network, where user login data is permanently saved in the chain;
    however, user authentication is done automatically through smart contracts. There
    was a double increase in the use of blockchain in 5G cloud computing networks.
    It also uses smart contracts and blockchains to test data security in cloud-centric
    IoT systems. Blockchain enters the cloud computing system to create a complete
    security network, there IoT metadata is saved in the blockchain, and real data
    is stored in cloud storage, which provides extensive coverage for densely packed
    IoT devices.

    IoT networks, the most appropriate optimization method for their RA problems is
    self-optimization. With self-optimization, each device (or user) is able to optimize
    its resources to provide the required services and improve the overall interests
    of the larger network [[5](#CR5)]. In general, a self-optimization solution for
    IoT helps to shift the focus from the design and placement of one or more autonomous
    elements to a large complex ecosystem of the elements network. Additional functions
    and system computing are often used in distributed autonomous computing systems
    to achieve self-optimization. Self-optimization in achieving the desired experience
    quality in a 5G network requires a switch on of these devices. Furthermore, neural
    networks can be used in 5G applications as an effective method of adaptive assessment
    of the quality perceived by users or user devices and self-optimization.

    and meta-heuristic solutions often offer only small optimal solutions, they are
    usually implemented in a much shorter time interval and with the complexity of

    to connect a broad variety of physical articles to the internet. Today, the IoT
    is increasingly infiltrating the global network room by improving the supply of
    hardware from tiny consumer devices to massive mechanical machines. Along these
    lines, IoT can possibly profoundly change the manner in which robotization is
    seen at the (physical) object level. IoT offers to energize new roads, particularly
    for businesses, since it inherently bolsters Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications.
    Normalization bodies are enthusiastically investigating such M2M correspondences
    [[3](#CR3)]. The development of versatile systems denoted its commencement in
    1980 as first age (1G) that simply bolstered voice correspondence. With 2G, computerized
    frameworks hit the market and in this manner the administrations such as instant
    message were presented. It was 3G which offered versatile broadband types of assistance
    with an improved degree of security. 4G, all things considered the current age,
    upgraded the data rate, security, and QoS while diminishing the inactivity. The
    versatile correspondence industry is not prepared for 5G. The progressions in
    IoT and the impending emergence of 5G have advocated the advancement of 5G-enabled
    IoT applications. Such applications have rigid prerequisites such as high limit,
    guaranteed protection and security, adaptability of heterogeneous applications,
    ultra-low inactivity, advanced utilization of system assets, efficient energy
    management, and low OPEX [[4](#CR4)]. Despite the fact that the security architectures
    that are currently being used form mobile networks and generic IoT systems match
    the necessary desires, they are concentrated on a basic level [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2),
    [5](#CR5)]. Utilizing such unified security answers for 5G and 5G-enabled IoT
    applications will prompt different hindrances, such as expanded expense because
    of innate heterogeneity, mind-boggling and static security of the executive’s
    methods, overuse of system assets, the formation of a bottleneck in the system,
    specific intention of discontent, and high OPEX. Consequently, proceeding with
    the utilization of unified security answers for 5G and IoT-driven applications
    will not only battle to fulfill the needs but will also antagonistically influence
    the anticipated dreams of 5G and IoT. In this specific situation, blockchain innovation
    is a promising structure solution because it can provide answers to all security

    crypto currency systems, and the blockchain infrastructure is mostly seen as secure
    for Bitcoin or potentially crypto-monetary applications in general. The system
    is, however, available for a wider range of applications and is being studied
    for a number of sectors. Alongside its reliance on cryptanalytic primitives and
    distributed systems, the various components of blockchain technology will make
    it difficult to grasp. However, each element would merely be interpreted, and
    it was seen as a building block to grasp the larger hierarchical system. Blockchains
    may be informally described as: blockchain technologies would be spread to public
    ledgers with cryptographically signed transactions clustered into blocks. A block
    is cryptographically connected to the previous one (making it clear) until it
    has been authenticated and sent to an agreement request. Through the introduction
    of new blocks, more established blocks are more difficult to modify (making protection
    from obstruction). Blocks are recreated across duplicates of the system record,
    and any contentions are settled by rules for mechanical exploitation. Trust is
    a key part of blockchain that is practiced by comparing the hash of the past block
    to deliver the following hub. So as to accomplish an accord, the “miner” hubs
    are at risk for approving the subsequent hash and afterward for finding the hash
    for the following lines. A lot of exchanges are packaged into blocks utilizing
    the Merkle tree, and just the Merkle root hash is added to the block, as shown
    in Fig. [9.3](#Fig3). This strategy is viewed as “Proof-of-Work” (POW) for work
    done on the network [[17](#CR17)] and furthermore on mining hubs. These prize
    models empower mining hubs to connect with mining blocks inside the system to
    share the processing assets they have. Actually, blockchain is unmistakable from

    phones, it is even popular for technological devices, including an icebox, computer,
    cars, and so on. In order to understand continuous device interaction and access
    more devices, a rapid site and data transmission functionality is required. This
    is also the underlying move for creativity in the fifth era (5G) and, as a result,
    the availability level is up to 25 Mps. The first beneficial circumstances of
    5G are fast knowledge delivery, lower inactivity, bolstering the virtual private
    network, strong data storage efficiency, and so on, the preeminent technology
    area of 5G is in the healthcare field, the scalable sector, IoT, AI, and so on.
    5G will combine every single corner of human existence with innovation through
    correspondence systems. Data is therefore critical and should be shielded from
    visual attack on sensitive details. The key health risks of 5G engineering are
    DoS attack, immersion attack, assault scanning, pacing assault, middle man assault,
    consumer misrepresentation, directing assault, etc. Therefore, as 5G tech co-ordinates
    with IoT and blockchain, security engineering is needed [[4](#CR4)] (Fig. [9.5](#Fig5)).![../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig5_HTML.png)

    and connectivity, is occurring, challenging and having us reconsider our ways
    of working. New usage cases for the platform are growing with the advent of the
    5G age when customers and companies continue to work on finding systems and platforms
    that can improve the quality of their lives and company. At the center of this
    technical transition is wireless communication. New market prospects are emerging—both
    to those who have previously invested in the supply chain, such as mobile companies,
    as well as to entrants from other fields. Attentively, innovative market structures
    are being built for centralized cloud infrastructure and network programming at
    the edge. The unprecedented appetite and passion for the sharing of ideas leads
    to a greater degree of interaction between individuals and different industries
    of some sort. Solutions are being developed involving a range of fields of specialization,
    changing existing economic practices, and redefining ecosystems. The cross-industry
    transition has provided a prerequisite for the advancement of the idea of cellular
    networking for the fifth generation of mobile technology (5G), providing new approaches
    to identify performance measurement and assessment as well as services. Compared
    to previous iterations of wireless technologies, including 4G, the reason for
    5G implementation is to broaden the connectivity reach of cell networks to offer
    new services not only for users but also for separate sectors of the community
    as a whole, As a consequence, the power of the Internet of Things is released.
    Ericsson’s latest report [[27](#CR27)] indicates that a limited number of European
    and North American operators agree that 5G is being more consumer-driven, while
    a standardized number in Asia-Pacific and Central and Latin America expect that
    5G is more business-driven. The Ericsson Replacement Survey [[28](#CR28)] notes
    the machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and wireless access. A substantial
    majority suggested that they will make major improvements to their industries
    in order to allow a greater benefit of 5G as they launch. Exploring the related
    market scenarios—in sectors such as agricultural, manufacturing, building, electricity,
    banking, safety, etc.—the 5G usage cases and their respective specifications are
    illustrated in this part. The development of the network elements to 5G is then
    discussed, accompanied by a description of the 5G framework. Finally, the 5G network
    is exemplified by three specific implementation events.

    One of the many features of the organizational layer is that the business and
    methodology rules the engines. IoT ties together the relationship and interaction
    of objects and structures that include details inside certain activities or legal
    statistics, such as the weather, the local area, and traffic data. Within the
    framework of the evaluation, distinctive analysis methods are required to dispose
    of the appropriate knowledge from a wide proportion of the knowledge and to be
    handled quickly. In-memory review allows vast volumes of information to be processed
    in random access memory rather than held in actual circles. In-memory testing
    decreases the time taken for data and speeds up the collection phase. Streaming
    evaluation is such a process where the measurement of knowledge, perceived to
    be moving data, is expected to be continuously managed at the same time that judgments
    are made as much as possible in only a few seconds. Data on the board is the opportunity
    to control the flow of knowledge. Information on the board inside the organizational
    layer is also provided, encouraged, and managed. Higher layer systems are generally
    protected from the need to process redundant details and reduce the risk of leakage
    of knowledge source vulnerabilities. Data splitting methods, such as metadata
    anonymization, data blending, and file matching, are used to hide a wide spectrum
    of information while merely supplying the details that can be used for a wide
    variety of purposes. In the convention of the same details, material is always
    deleted to softly expand the details point of view of the mill to more unmistakable
    deftness and reuse across spaces. Protection must be lawfully recognized in the
    whole portion of the IoT program from the sagacious layer of the document to the

    scale of IoT in the measured study, reporting that 5.5 million additional items
    will be introduced on a day-to-day basis, and 6.4 billion similar items will be
    used globally in 2016, which is 30% more than in 2015\. In addition, the study

- en: How Blockchain WorksA block in blockchain consists of the details, the hash
    of the block, the hash of the previous block. The data held within each block
    depends on the form of blockchain. As an example, inside the Bitcoin blockchain
    system, the block holds details on the recipient, the sender, and hence the amount
    of coins. A hash is a kind of special fingerprint that has a long list of a combination
    of digits and letters. The block hash is generated with the help of a cryptographic
    hash (SHA 256) calculation. Subsequently, this enables the definition of every
    block in a blockchain network without any complications. The moment the block
    is created, it immediately absorbs the hash, while any adjustment made during
    the block always influences the difference in the hash. As a matter of theory,
    hashes help to define any changes in blocks (Fig. [9.9](#Fig9)).![../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png)

    256）计算生成的。随后，这使得在区块链网络中定义每个块变得毫无复杂性。一旦块被创建，它立即吸收哈希，而在块期间进行的任何修改都会影响哈希的差异。从理论上讲，哈希有助于定义块的任何更改（图[9.9](#Fig9)）。![../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png)

- en: The last component inside the block is the hash from a past block. This makes
    a succession of blocks and is the primary component behind blockchain design’s
    security. The absolute first block during a chain might be somewhat unique—all
    affirmed and approved blocks are obtained from the beginning block. Any degenerate
    endeavors incite the blocks to shift. All the resulting blocks at that point convey
    falsehood and render the whole blockchain framework invalid. On the other hand,
    in principle, it may be conceivable to manage all the blocks with the help of
    solid PC processors. In any case, an answer eliminates this chance called proof-of-work.
    This empowers a client to hamper the strategy for the production of most recent
    blocks. In Bitcoin blockchain engineering, it takes around 10 minutes to work
    out the necessary proof-of-work and add a substitution block to the chain. This
    work is finished by miners—exceptional hubs inside the Bitcoin blockchain structure.
    Miners get the opportunity to keep the exchange charges from the block that they
    checked as a payment.

- en: A new client (hub) who enters the mutual blockchain network might get a complete
    replica of the application. When a replacement block is made, it is sent to each
    hub within the blockchain network. At that point, each hub confirms the block
    and checks whether the information expressed is correct. In case it is all correct,
    the block is connected to the blockchain neighborhood of any node. All centers
    of blockchain systems have an agreement. The arrangement structure might be a
    ton of protocol guidelines, and thus once anyone submits to them, they are self-authorized
    within the blockchain. For starters, the Bitcoin blockchain illustrates an arrangement
    that agrees to declare that the trade volume will be sliced down the center for
    every 200,000 blocks. This suggests that if a block delivers a check prize of
    10 BTC, this value must be divided by 200,000 blocks. Moreover, there will be
    4 million BTC remaining to be produced, because there is a cap of 21 million BTC
    established by the consensus within the Bitcoin network system. When the miners
    open too many of them, the usability of Bitcoins disappears unless the rule is
    modified (Fig. [9.10](#Fig10)).![../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig10_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig10_HTML.png)

    Various types of assets are available, such as registration, stockpiling, equipment,
    transport, VNFs, etc. The device is cut to control the optimal behavior of the
    program. Such behavior is commonly associated with protection, disconnection of
    knowledge sources, essence of administration, unwavering efficiency, and autonomous
    charging. A network cut may improve one or more administrators; therefore, it
    would not be appropriate to plan for a remote administrator to do so, which can
    provide an altered level of support. System cutting is regularly used for a few
    purposes: an entire private system, a reproduction of an open system to check
    the administration of substitution, or an overhead system for the chosen administration.
    For example, when fixing an individual system within such a system cut, which
    will be a beginning to end practically confined to a piece of the overall population
    arrangement, the system uncovered a collection of capabilities in terms of data
    transmission, dormancy, accessibility, and so on. From this stage on, the cut
    is frequently monitored personally by the cutter, who can see the machine cut
    as their own network along with transport centers, handling, and power. The assets

    and capacities to remotely see organization assets, similar to databases, switches,
    connections, and information, without breaking the overall physical foundation,

    splits a physical device into various virtual structures, such that the devices
    are periodically reconfigured to re-engineer new systems as required. The WNFV
    as a feature for 5G networks would allow the virtualization of the whole network
    ability and detangle the organization of 5G-IoT. WNFV offers an adaptable and
    scalable framework for 5G-IoT applications that will allow the modified device
    to mold programmable devices for 5G-IoT applications. The WNFV can have 5G-IoT
    network implementations with the capacity to plan by streamlining the speed, capability,
    and functionality inside the networks to match the burden of usage. Additionally,
    the WNFV should boost the reasonableness of the Radio Access Arrangement (RAN)
    as a whole. Inside the HetNet 5G-IoT infrastructure strain, a number of 5G systems
    with a multi-RAT network will be used to fulfill the needs of the application

    similar to how intensive care units are monitored nowadays. Blockchain technology
    is perhaps the silver bullet needed for industry. The blockchain functions as
    a distributed transaction ledger for various IoT transactions. The blockchain
    platform supports and uses simple key management systems. The Ethereum platform
    is capable of managing a more fine-grained way used in many IoT devices with successful
    smart Turing complete code.

- en: In this chapter, we proposed a 5G-enabled blockchain e-healthcare framework.
    The focus of this framework is a patient e-health management system. E-Health
    introduced the fog/edge used for easy access of medical data, as well as patient
    safety and privacy concern. Blockchain is deployed in the e-health system. This
    consist of three interfaces (1) Near Processing Layer, (2) Far Processing Layer
    and (3) Data Sensing Layer, and an agent Migration Handler (MH) used to monitor
    and transfer tasks which will help to locate the client. The current healthcare
    system is not patient friendly because patients must continually spend time monitoring
    their illness instead of resting, which is inconvenient for the patients. Wasted
    patient time has been reduced in our proposed system.

    A cluster is formed by a fog/edge agent with a different patient member value,
    where a representative is selected to be the head of the cluster. The cluster
    head (also called the leader) is involved in running the blockchain consensus
    protocol by locking a certain amount of stake in the network. From each cluster,
    a cluster head (CH) is chosen, taking into account the member nodes’ multi-criteria.
    The selection process includes the performance characteristics of a node, its
    reputation and the stake amount. Criteria are combined to measure a fitness value
    using a decision tree. The blockchain records the information of each node regarding
    the parameters listed, and can be retrieved from the blockchain.

    of the Agent. The Agent broadcasts its identifier across the cluster since its
    waiting time expires. The other cluster members verify the estimated fitness of
    the Agent and accept their approval for this Agent. In turn, every node in a cluster
    will participate in the PoS proposed. This consensus mechanism would be less vulnerable
    to an attack of 51% from each cluster than DPoS as a leader. The rich node, such
    as PoS, is less likely to become a cluster leader, as the cluster head is not
    only selected based on the locked coin.

    shows a significant decrease in energy consumption compared to the regular one.
    A block is validated by a few selected safe miners in the updated one, but the
    standard one requires more than 50% node participation in the block validation
    process, resulting in higher energy consumption. Updated energy consumption remains
    almost constant for a comparable number of clusters with a greater number of nodes,
    while energy consumption tends to increase as the number of nodes within the network
    increases (Fig. [10.4](#Fig4)).![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.png)

    The graph in Fig. [10.5](#Fig5) illustrates that the time for the standard generation
    of blocks is greater than for the updated one. As normal, different nodes send
    their transactions to one leader node for validation, and to broadcast across
    the network, a validated block is required. The approach thus consumes higher
    energy and makes it possible to take a longer time for the block’s network-wide
    casting. In addition, some good miners are selected based on reputation, results
    and stake in the revised one, but a miner based on investment or stake alone is
    regularly nominated.![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig5_HTML.png)

    of reliability and overhead touch. The protection protocol is correlated with
    these two performance metrics. The graph in Fig. [10.6](#Fig6) shows that our
    eHealth is more robust than the current system due to our decentralized Key Management
    and several three-layer Patient Agent instances.![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig6_HTML.png)

    security mechanism provided greater overhead communication than the current one.
    An Agent needs a certain number of data encryption segments to be obtained from
    other neighbouring Agents to form the entire secret key. This technique activates
    overhead communication when exchanging hidden keys and authenticating.![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig7_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig7_HTML.png)

    is shown in Table [10.1](#Tab1). Similar to the cloud, with different protection
    strategies or without protection, different stakeholders deploy heterogeneous
    fog devices. Fog networks, through the identification and analysis of health information,
    are vulnerable to malicious attacks. In our architecture, the same patient agent
    replicated in the Mobile, Fog scheme and Cloud will protect wellbeing. To keep
    a Record of Malicious Attacks, sensitive medical information is analysed in the
    homogeneous replicated Patient Agent in order to protect the privacy or confidentiality
    of the patient.Table 10.1

    unlikely to happen because the cluster head will lose its reputation to share
    when it is detected as malicious. The consensus mechanism should select the malicious
    and cluster members who do not collect transactions for verification while the
    head of the cluster is down.

- en: 'In this chapter, we built an eHealth program that deployed several instances
    of a three-layer Patient Agent software: sensing, near processing and far processing
    layer, which make the eHealth software more stable and fault-sensitive. We also
    defined how to implement the Patient Agent on a 5G unit. The dedicated Patient
    Agent application is able to handle the resources of 5G network slices. A performance
    analysis has shown that the emerging eHealth program will use blockchain technology
    to process health data in near-real time. The implementation of blockchain healthcare
    technology is difficult, with vast volumes of health data constantly being transmitted
    from wearable sensors.'
