    real-world objects. It can play a vital role in many domains to improve the quality
    of life in different areas such as smart homes, medical health, education, industry,
    agriculture, transports, and smart cities. Now there is a paradigm shift towards
    the concept of “anytime, anywhere, anyone, connected to anything.” In many areas,
    whether it is our homes or workplace, the devices are becoming essential for our
    daily lifestyle. IoT has made it possible to connect everyone with everything
    in the environment [[1](#CR1)]. Connecting different devices and adding sensors
    enhance a level of intelligence to devices, otherwise they would be dumb, making
    them transfer up-to-date data without any human involvement. The organization

    (ICT) era, the present demands are high-speed, super-low latency, and massive
    capacity. These demands are fulfilled by the version of the 5G ultra-wide band
    network and are treated as one of the important features for technological growth
    [[1](#CR1)]. To serve the connectivity needs for the present ICT for faster network
    with higher capacity, the 5G technology is essential for the IoT. It expands the
    frequencies from which the digital cellular technologies will transmit the information.
    This, in turn, will upsurge the overall bandwidth of the cellular linkages and
    allow other devices to connect into the network. There are many areas where the
    combinations of the 5G and IoT [[2](#CR2)] can prove to be a boon and are discussed
    here in the chapter. One of the important usages for the same is Virtual Reality
    and Augmented Reality (AR/VR) [[3](#CR3)]. The ultralow latency will enhance the
    experiences of the AR/VR operations and for the industries, this will be significantly
    benefited from the ultra-fast information broadcast to the time-sensitive nature
    of the corresponding outcomes.

    first generation mobile network). The 1G was all about the voice only, then comes
    the 2G. Through 2G both texting and voice can be done. The 3G was used for data,
    texting, and voice. In addition to the functions of 3G, the 4G was faster than
    the 3G. The 5G is even faster than the 4G. This 5G is so fast enough to download
    an HD movie (full-length) in seconds [[4](#CR4)]. The 5G is not only faster, but
    this also supports high-speed connectivity, fast downloads, lower latency, and
    supports the ubiquitous coverage for transportation and smart vehicles. The examples
    for the same can be connected buses, cars, and trucks for the smooth flow of the
    traffic [[5](#CR5)] and to avoid the four ways crash at the intersection pathways.

    services of the Cloud, like Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service
    (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This also provides many features
    such as scalability, security, resource management, etc. [[7](#CR7)]. CC also
    sanctions storage and data transfer through the internet with an uninterrupted
    transfer of pieces of information between the applications, IoT devices, and Clouds
    itself. When the capabilities of CC combine with the IoT, these stacks bring added
    services for the business applications and consumers. The Cloud ecosystem processes
    and analyzes the data quickly to make an intelligent decision as soon as possible.
    The IoT developers can store the data remotely and access effortlessly through
    CC. As CC is booming nowadays and has fuelled the progress of IoT ecosystems.
    The evolving IoT architecture can be lavish/expensive without the Cloud infrastructure.
    Hence migrating IoT data into the cloud lets our cost reduce and has other advantages
    too and is discussed in the other sections.

    the generation wise evolution of the wireless network, where firstly the 1G has
    come into the picture and was used for wireless phone calls, secondly the 2G has
    evolved and was used for basic texting, doing emails, and playing games. Then

    with the 5G, in a very fast and convenient way. As many of the IoT devices connect
    to each other, the coordination among the IoT devices will also increase. The
    huge data that will be generated via these IoT devices are processed in the edge

    devices, and this will result in decreased latency and response time. The edge
    computing also offloads the Core cloud computing jobs into itself. The edge computing

    high-resolution cameras (a total of five cameras) and infrared red thermometer
    capable of measuring the temperature of the ten peoples simultaneously within
    a radius of 5–6 m. Doing these things physically/manually will lead to potential
    health threats and public safety will be exposed. If the conditions such as high
    temperature and a person without the mask are identified, then the robot will
    send the alert to the concerned authorities (the central control system for making
    a real-time decision based on the responses). These robots can be handled through
    remotes and are self-driven and reduce the need for manpower and patrolling responsibilities
    too. The same is depicted in Fig. [7.4](#Fig4). There are various demands of such
    5G based robots in every corner of the world and have already been spotted in
    areas such as shopping malls and airports. The technologies that these 5G robots
    will use are Big data, Cloud Computing, edge computing, AI, and IoT. By combining
    these aforementioned technologies, the robots can sense, do autonomous motion
    control, dynamic decision-making, and can do behavioral penetration and sensing.
    To take action at run time the 5G patrol robots are power-driven by industrial

    How will the technology become a shield for this? The answer is to go with 5G
    and IoT technology, which will reduce the workforce and avoid the necessity for
    the human being while reducing its physical presence. These technologies will
    improve the monitoring capabilities of the health of city populations, and the
    services will have a reduced response time in emergencies. The following case
    study will focus on working of this.

    [[47](#CR47)]. Through 5G and the IoT devices, the healthcare benefactors can
    gather health-related data from the patients immediately and monitor their conditions
    for preventive and personalized care. This can be used for training junior doctors
    for doing surgery through AR/VR with high bandwidth 5G and low latency. The replacement
    of the wired connections in the operating theatres could be replace with the powerful,
    secure wireless connections of 5G and low latency. The other usages are to enrich
    the remote real-time diagnostics by delivering good quality video using 5G. The
    5G based network with high bandwidth connectivity and low latency can be used
    in robotics technologies for dispensing medicines, support for diagnostics, and
    even for performing surgery. The usages of cloud connectivity will support for
    doing data analytics across the records of the medical information. This information
    will contain data about the CT scans and can help with treatment prioritization.
    Figure [7.5](#Fig5) reflects about the information on various health parameters
    of the patients is detected using the wireless IoT devices and the information’s
    are collected and passed to the cloud with the help of 5G technology [[48](#CR48)].
    The doctors and other services will be connected to the cloud for doing their
    operations based upon the intelligent decision made through data analysis.![../images/501059_1_En_7_Chapter/501059_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_7_Chapter/501059_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png)

    because of the product lifecycle and shorter business, the manufacturing industries
    around the world are under extreme pressure. As the components increasingly become
    more complex and varied to produce; which in turn shows that the margins are being
    squeezed. As the conditions of workforces are being matured, this becomes costlier
    to maintain [[49](#CR49)]. The 5G based IoT and cloud computing can solve these
    problems to an extent and are being discussed here. The edge computing will enable
    conveniences to scale the number of deployed platforms, connected devices, and
    real-time data analytics. The last mile fiber can be replaced with the 5G network,
    which will result in a cost-effective and flexible approach. For the reduction
    or avoiding failures, the 5G based microrobots could accomplish the sensor’s inspection
    and share data in real-time for reducing cost and fault prevention. For security

    control can be achieved through running private networks to provide better utility
    and control. The demanding Service level agreements (SLAs) must be incorporated
    for the adaption of the 5G and trusted data services. For the management of cybersecurity
    and increasing volume of information (the veracity of data), 5G wireless networks
    are required. The market-oriented computing works in collaboration with the utilities

    on the road by 2025, and the connected vehicle services will be worth 81 US $
    billion by 2030 as per the data of strategy and PWC 2019 [[51](#CR51)]. These

    networks. The other aspect related to the connected vehicles system is the impact
    of the safety and well-being of the citizens. As per the data released by the

    dramatic changes and has attracted a great deal of attention to IoT-based industry
    automation with the advent and application of modern technologies such as digital
    twin, cloud computing, big data, edge and service-oriented technology, and advanced
    sensing technology [[2](#CR2)]. At the same time, the world has advanced industrial
    production methods such as Industry 4.0, Health 4.0, Education 4.0, cloud manufacturing,
    and Internet + manufacturing, and national strategic manufacturing ideas in many
    countries, such as Made in China 2025, the US manufacturing strategic plan, and
    the transition to a digital economy in Uzbekistan are being promoted. The overall
    goal is to automate the industry through advanced digital production methods.

    Of course, such processes require the use of IoT systems in industrial automation
    and a network capable of transmitting large amounts of data quickly. Different
    IoT systems use many wireless technologies such as 2/3/4G mobile network, Wi-Fi,
    WiMAX, etc., and thousands of devices are connected to each other via those smart
    wireless technologies [[16](#CR16)].

    communication, 3G mobile networks (currently covering 65% of society overworld)
    to data and voice, and 4G mobile networks to high-speed rate Internet communication.
    3G and 4G mobile network have significantly increased capabilities that ensure
    Internet access to the IoT device. The available 3G and 4G mobile networks are
    the most effective communication technologies of IoT, offering IoT application
    designed for industrial automation with a comprehensive, high level of security,
    low cost, efficient access to the allocated spectrum, and simplicity of management.
    Also, 4G “long-term evolution” (LTE) has become the quickest and most tenable
    type of network technology relatively to popular technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE,
    WiMAX, LoRa, Sigfox, ZigBee, and others [[1](#CR1), [28](#CR28), [47](#CR47)].
    However, existing mobile networks do not support MTC (Machine-Type Communication),
    which are the basis of IoT, and are not fully optimized for such systems [[16](#CR16),
    [17](#CR17)]. Emerging 5G networks provide a potential solution in this case.
    5G provides fast mobile network data transfer in the shortest possible time and
    offers improved coverage for MTC connectivity without negating the current 4G
    (LTE) network based on IoT requirements. As next-generation communication network,
    5G is supposed to address issues that arise in 3G and 4G networks, such as in
    smart management application (smart city, smart home, smart transportation) or
    more complex communication, intelligence, and large-scale data processing, which
    is important for IoT systems designed for industrial automation [[10](#CR10)].
    The development of 5G is created via 4G LTE-based system, which provides voice
    and data transmission to users and provides them with a fast connection to the
    Internet. The 5G network provides reliable and fast connectivity and significantly
    increases data transfer speeds for IoT applications designed for industrial automation.
    The current 4G LTE network can provide speeds up to 1 GB/s, but the 4G signal
    can be easily extinguished due to buildings, Wi-Fi signals, microwave signals,
    and other wave interference [[16](#CR16)]. 5G networks provide users with higher
    data speeds up to 10 Gb/s than 4G networks; moreover, the network itself provides
    reliable connectivity to thousands of devices [[16](#CR16), [17](#CR17)].

    Many of the arising and rapidly developing concepts such as E-transportation,
    E-banking, E-agriculture, E-healthcare, E-security, E-industry, E-manufacturing,
    etc. introduced in these systems are increasingly manifested, and they rely on
    the development of 5G-enabled IoT technologies [[10](#CR10)]. It should be noted
    that since the emergence of the 5G-enabled IoT concept and its prospects, all
    stakeholders in the telecommunications sector, especially in the field of education
    and industry, have intensified their interest in it. Simply put, 5G-enabled IoT
    describes new and very important Internet-connected tools for the coming future
    – representing the possibility of using effective autonomous services with minimal
    human intervention or participation, when various devices or objects (buildings,

    of 5G-enabled IoT applications for industrial automation. Such applications place
    high demands on high capacity, reliable privacy and security, coverage of various
    applications, very low latency, optimized use of network resources, and efficient
    energy management. Although the security architectures currently used in mobile
    networks and general IoT systems meet the requirements, they are largely centralized
    [[18](#CR18), [22](#CR22)]. The use of such centralized security solutions for
    5G and 5G-enabled IoT applications leads to various barriers, such as genetic
    heterogeneity, complex and static security management procedures, overuse of network
    resources, cost overruns due to network failure increase, etc. Thus, the continued
    use of centralized security solutions for applications managed by 5G and IoT not

    production pointers on the shop-floor. It is known that automation technology
    is widely used in shop-floor production, so it is necessary to build large-scale
    automatic production lines in this. On the one hand, the production process of
    a component or product includes several sub-processes, and various production
    types of equipment on the production line perform various processing tasks. On
    the other hand, a single robot with limited machining functions and structure
    is usually unable to perform complex machining tasks such as double mounting or
    performing multiple functions at the same time. In addition, in a high-intensity
    environment, some manufacturing processes require remote control of the functions
    of a large number of robots to perform a specific production task. This manufacturing
    process requires a very precise transmission and a very low latency for two-direction
    data transmission and instruction control between the control center and the shop-floor
    equipment. However, it is very difficult for 3G/4G networks to meet low-latency
    and high-reliability requirements of industrial automation [[29](#CR29)].

    Some production processes do not have the flexibility feature in some machines,
    so it is hard to satisfy the requirements of various production operations. In
    other production processes, due to the need for manual handling of non-ergonomic
    tasks, workers have to load heavy workloads. With the machine performing specific
    tasks and the flexibility of the person, the machine can quickly adjust the operating
    mode according to the instructions given by the workers by pressing a button,
    body movement, or sound. Besides, when workers enter the range of motion of the
    machine, the machine (e.g., robot, machine tool) should slow down, and if necessary,
    the machines have to stop tracking to ensure worker safety. The production model
    produced by human-machine cooperation not only increases productivity but also
    makes the production system more strong and adjustable. However, low-latency and
    very-high-reliability communication technologies are required to ensure safe and
    efficient cooperation between human and machine.

    works jointly with the manipulator and different things for loading and unloading
    goods but also cooperates with other AGVs and can automatically find a power source
    for self-charging. In this case, the AGV determines the location of objects in
    the environment, the condition of other AGVs, the value of battery level, etc.,
    and makes decisions by performing computing quickly. While AGV performs such tasks
    intelligently, it requires a communication network to transmit the data collected
    from them to the data center or to receive control information. Therefore, high-reliability
    and low-latency communication technologies are required for AGV. To implement
    the above three advanced manufacturing processes, a large number of small antenna
    matrices operating on the basis of SDMA can realize flexible strong directional
    electro signal transmission and optimize efficiency in a particular direction.
    To improve communication quality and reduce channel interference, the antenna
    matrix uses multi-signal technology, thereby increasing the reliability of transmission.

    base station form to a centralized user mode, and the base network resources are

    more attention is usually paid to the latter. For achieving better production
    results, it is necessary to simulate, analyze, and study the product model before
    completing the project. Therefore, firstly, virtual/augmented reality is used
    in product design. Secondly, in production processes, operational steps and processes
    to increase efficiency and reduce errors can be provided to an employee who assembles
    parts virtually with virtual/augmented reality technologies. Besides, with complexity
    and the high degree of integration of production equipment, its repair and maintenance
    are becoming increasingly complex. With the support of virtual/augmented reality,
    workers can receive real-time maintenance suggestions. But, in production processes
    based on virtual/augmented reality, the data transmitted is in the form of a very
    large amount of media data flow. Therefore, in order to reach a seamless connection
    within virtual/augmented reality, manufacturing, and industrial automation process,
    a new mobile network technology with lower latency and faster transmission speed
    features is required than 3G/4G technology [[29](#CR29)]. The eMBB characteristic
    with high frequency of 5G network provides higher transmission speed and throughput
    than 4G mobile networks to implement the automation of the above two advanced
    industrial production processes. The 28 Ghz and 60 Ghz frequencies in every frequency
    ranges of the mm-wave are the most efficient frequencies of 5G network. The maximum
    bandwidth in a wireless connection is about 5% of the carrier frequency, so it
    is possible to achieve a transfer rate ten times faster than a 4G network connection.
    Furthermore, a 5G network connection based on software-configured network (SDN)
    architecture and C-RAN provides a freely connected management mode between C-Plan
    (communication plan) and D-Plan (data plan), which increases the efficiency of

- en: By adding security features and simplifying service management, blockchains
    are expected to make 5G network services easier. Blockchain is especially effective
    in creating a secure data-sharing or spectrum-transmitting environment on 5G networks.
    Blockchain is seen as a middle layer for performing spectrum trading, checking
    transaction exchanges, and reliably leasing the spectrum provided by spectrum
    source suppliers (license holders). To perform access authentication, unlike traditional
    database management systems that use a centralized server, blockchain can do decentralized
    user access verification applying the computing power of all legitimate participants
    in the network with smart contracts [[30](#CR30)]. This causes the exchange system
    very robust to data changes. Numerous researches on blockchain show that it is
    effective for spectrum management in terms of improved usability with a higher
    level of security, better scalability for blockchain adoption, and an improved
    system of defense against threats and DoS attacks [[31](#CR31)]. In addition,
    with a high level of security on 5G networks, blockchain can simplify network
    virtualization [[32](#CR32)]. Blockchain technology provides the necessary features
    of non-rejection and permanency to overcome the shortcomings of prior centralized
    architecture in virtual networks. Specifically, the blockchain has the ability
    to create secure VWNs (virtual wireless networks), so that resource holders on
    the wireless network can hand over wireless resources (e.g., radiofrequency, infrastructure,
    spectrum layer) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In such decentralized
    virtual networks, smart contracts may be most beneficial to ensure transparency
    and automation in a distributed manner instead of leaning on a special node or
    authorization process, which increases the reliability of resource management
    services. Creating a reliable and fair economic scheme with blockchain may be
    an important solution for managing network interference, particularly in small
    mobile blocks [[8](#CR8)]. Blockchain platforms provide strong data protection
    by entering user data into the ledger. In the ledger, data is signed by hash functions
    and added to blocks. Blockchain has the ability to provide complete control over
    personal data in a network exchange, which is unusual from all traditional approaches
    that prevent users from observing data [[8](#CR8)]. In addition, the blockchain
    may be offering a wide range of security capabilities, such as smart contracts,
    decentralized ledger-based data integrity, and access control through the permission
    process and smart contract authentication.

    End-to-end latency from a network perspective is the sum of the individual delay

    unit to optimize latency. It is recommended that the central management unit and
    the main protection are usually located in one place to prevent thrombosis of
    the signal flow. The distribution of the central user part reduces the waiting
    time by keeping user traffic as local as possible and is therefore typically distributed

    that are widely used in the ecosystems of smart and highly heterogeneous devices.
    There has been a lot of research on 5G-based IoT over the last few years on a
    complex and interesting topic. Much of this research has been devoted to the research
    works of 5G-enabled IoT requirements. The requirements for the 5G network are
    standardized in the 3GPP recommendation.

    as the 3GPP recommendation. Even though high-level demands were collected from
    a variety of sources, one of the previous standards created for these requirements
    was the ITU-R M.2083-0\. In describing the key features of the various applications
    of 5G-based IoT in industrial automation, this standard first identified three
    major communication technologies: eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. There are a number of
    technical requirements for a 5G network, which are distributed across these technologies.
    In this case, the basic requirements for eMBB include all the requirements for
    the 5G network and include connection density, latency, mobility, spectrum efficiency,
    user-experienced data rate, peak data rate, area traffic capacity, and network
    energy efficiency. The high requirements for URLLC include only two of them, mobility
    and delay. mMTC, like URLLC, meets only two basic requirements for a 5G network:
    network energy efficiency and connection capacity [[4](#CR4)]. Of course, these
    technologies must meet other requirements in the network, but the demand for them
    is relatively low.'

    control applications in vertical areas. The detailed level of this quasi-standard
    should be grounded, i.e., the standardized values for high reliability (between
    99.999% and 99.999999%), latency (0.5–500 ms at different connections), and long-term
    reliability (average failure time between 1 day to 10 years) should ensure the
    widespread use of 5G. This recommendation involves different requirements for
    both periodic and nonperiodic deterministic (or nondeterministic) communication,
    time synchronization, mixed traffic, network operations, and positioning. The
    requirements are also developed on the basis of the types of connections and cover
    the various uses of future industry in enterprises, central power generation,
    power distribution, as well as medical and hospital institutions (in particular
    clear requirements for robotic surgery). In addition, “vehicle-to-everything (V2X)”
    technology in the industry sector is also expected to require a large amount of
    5G network resources, and the relevant requirements for this technology are detailed

    and industry network, where user login data is permanently saved in the chain;

    of computing services with capabilities for data storage, task processing, QoS
    improvements, and heterogeneity support. The distributed structure of edge computing
    also offers advantages ranging from a variety of computing services to a reduction
    in network management complexity resulting from a sharp increase in IoT devices
    and rapid growth in demand for 5G services. However, its safety is an important
    issue. The data exchange of 5G services can be weak to cyber attacks in a dynamic
    peak computing environment (e.g., attacks such as network congestion, information
    theft, denial of services, etc.). In addition, the configuration and setting data
    provided by edge service providers (ESPs) must be reliable and protected, but
    in reality, the MEC system cannot fully meet this requirement due to its high
    dynamics and transparency. Another challenging issue is to ensure the confidentiality
    and integrity of 5G heterogeneous information from external sources. The existing

    as migrating virtual machines (VMs) or allocating resources using regulated protocols,
    and VMs can also offer special functions. Furthermore, currently, communication
    security among the regulator and the physical mechanisms is a major issue. In
    fact, this architecture is very sensitive to attacks that occur for a variety
    of reasons. VMs can be created by hackers to run on a server and can also be used
    to perform external attacks to reject service. In addition, internal attacks by

    the blockchain may simplify NFV networks in three main ways. Firstly, the blockchain
    allows for better regulation of VNF services and the implementation of reliable,
    easy, and flexible management for network management. Secondly, the blockchain
    protects the delivery of network functions and the integrity of the system from
    internal attacks and external threats, i.e., detrimental DoS attacks and VM modifications.
    Finally, blockchain can accomplish verification of data and monitoring of system
    status while networking connection. In the figure below, we can see the architecture

    management. To support different models of IoT systems, 5G relies on the idea
    of network slicing. This allows operators to allocate their networks to particular
    applications and services such as industrial automation applications, smart factory,
    smart home, or transportation. In addition, network slicing leads to a number
    of security problems, including security threats in network slices and resource
    allocation among segments of intersection between domains [[46](#CR46)].

    cross-slice management security. Blockchain may be used to create a safe end-to-end
    network slice and allow network slice providers to manage their resources. The
    blockchain is used to create a mediation mechanism across the network slices to
    ensure secure and personal agreements between isolated network layer supplier
    and a resource provider for 5G services. When a network slice supplier sends or
    receives a request to set up a slice from end to end, it sends it to the blockchain
    to track and distribute the process. Smart contracts have been developed to support
    the placement of small slice components, called slice smart contracts (SSCs),
    where each SSC identifies the resources required for a small slice. In this way,
    resource suppliers can trade resources under contracts with small slice components.
    All information related to the placement of additional small slice is permanently
    stored in an authorized blockchain managed by the network slicing provider. The
    use of technology based on blockchain not only attaches security capabilities
    but also supports accountability and privacy in network slicing.

    of technology which allows mobile devices/machines (e.g., smartphones, tablets,
    etc.) to communicate directly with each other without an access point or a core
    network of mobile infrastructure. M2M/D2D uses device connection compatibility
    to make efficient use of available resources, which improves overall system throughput,
    reduces communication interruptions, and reduces power consumption and traffic
    load [[45](#CR45)]. Thus, the M2M/D2D connection can promote new “peer-to-peer”
    and “location-based” services and applications, making it compatible with next-generation
    5G mobile network services.

    Indeed, data exchange between devices can be at risk of data transmission due
    to various threats in the unreliable environment of M2M/D2D. In addition, M2M/D2D
    devices have a high level of unreliability, and if the network does not have an
    authentication mechanism, illegal access to resources on the servers will be possible.
    In addition, existing M2M/D2D architectures rely on external management to allow
    data access and require authentication during D2D/M2M communication, which can
    lead to unnecessary communication interruptions and degrade the overall performance

    This means that the expected speed, reliability, and access capabilities for both

    to solve resource allocation problems. However, the specific features and scope
    of 5G-based IoT do not allow direct application of traditional optimization techniques,
    so RA problems in 5G-based IoT applications require the development of clear and

    in 5G-based IoTs. The research in this section analyzes various optimization solutions
    designed to solve RA problems in 5G-based IoT applications. The following describes

    optimization, RA problems in 5G-based IoT applications are identified and solved
    using efficiently organized optimization methods such as linear programming and

    IoT networks, the most appropriate optimization method for their RA problems is
    self-optimization. With self-optimization, each device (or user) is able to optimize
    its resources to provide the required services and improve the overall interests
    of the larger network [[5](#CR5)]. In general, a self-optimization solution for
    IoT helps to shift the focus from the design and placement of one or more autonomous
    elements to a large complex ecosystem of the elements network. Additional functions
    and system computing are often used in distributed autonomous computing systems
    to achieve self-optimization. Self-optimization in achieving the desired experience
    quality in a 5G network requires a switch on of these devices. Furthermore, neural
    networks can be used in 5G applications as an effective method of adaptive assessment
    of the quality perceived by users or user devices and self-optimization.

    and management of various large-scale heterogeneous networks that combine IoT,
    which is one of the main problems of RA. For example, the control system of a
    network of self-optimizing sensors will be able to automatically adjust itself
    with saving energy at the same time. Such an advanced management system needs
    to be flexible and robustly built to withstand significant structural changes.
    The development of such management systems is critical to creating an effective

    or analytical conclusions, only the logical basis for solving certain problems
    in 5G-based IoT. A meta-heuristic solution is used for problems where multiple
    local “optimal” solutions can be found for a particular RA problem. Although heuristic
    and meta-heuristic solutions often offer only small optimal solutions, they are
    usually implemented in a much shorter time interval and with the complexity of
    computing networks, even in large networks. Therefore, heuristic and meta-heuristic
    optimization methods have been widely used in solving RA problems.

    an IoT technology was created in which nodes containing the same IoT functions
    had to regulate their buffer capture and frequency functions. The study showed

    that need to be accomplished at the same time. Sometimes these goals conflict
    with each other, resulting in the RA problem being complicated and difficult to
    solve. For example, in 5G, the goal of the RA problem may be to simultaneously
    minimize data transmission time, minimize the power required to transmit that
    data, and at the same time increase the total amount of data transmitted over
    a specified time interval. These goals are contradictory, as minimizing power
    and increasing data transfer at the same time is a challenge. Multipurpose optimization
    methods are used to solve this type of problem.

    main thing is that the current resource management architecture relies mainly
    on a central authority that performs resource allocation and user access control,
    but such models remain the risk of damage of the one side and safety of the other
    side. In addition, the tracking capability of existing resource allocation systems

    Blockchain is used to develop a decentralized resource allocation architecture,

    architecture. When providing IoT data adaptive computing services, resource allocation
    must be dynamically adjusted without any centralized management to maintain high
    QoS. Blockchain is very responsive to such scenarios and requires the use of distributed
    ledgers to update resource information automatically and reliably. In the condition

    of working. New usage cases for the platform are growing with the advent of the
    5G age when customers and companies continue to work on finding systems and platforms
    that can improve the quality of their lives and company. At the center of this
    technical transition is wireless communication. New market prospects are emerging—both
    to those who have previously invested in the supply chain, such as mobile companies,
    as well as to entrants from other fields. Attentively, innovative market structures
    are being built for centralized cloud infrastructure and network programming at
    the edge. The unprecedented appetite and passion for the sharing of ideas leads
    to a greater degree of interaction between individuals and different industries
    of some sort. Solutions are being developed involving a range of fields of specialization,
    changing existing economic practices, and redefining ecosystems. The cross-industry
    transition has provided a prerequisite for the advancement of the idea of cellular
    networking for the fifth generation of mobile technology (5G), providing new approaches
    to identify performance measurement and assessment as well as services. Compared
    to previous iterations of wireless technologies, including 4G, the reason for
    5G implementation is to broaden the connectivity reach of cell networks to offer
    new services not only for users but also for separate sectors of the community
    as a whole, As a consequence, the power of the Internet of Things is released.
    Ericsson’s latest report [[27](#CR27)] indicates that a limited number of European
    and North American operators agree that 5G is being more consumer-driven, while
    a standardized number in Asia-Pacific and Central and Latin America expect that
    5G is more business-driven. The Ericsson Replacement Survey [[28](#CR28)] notes

    in order to allow a greater benefit of 5G as they launch. Exploring the related
    market scenarios—in sectors such as agricultural, manufacturing, building, electricity,
    banking, safety, etc.—the 5G usage cases and their respective specifications are

    of the block, the hash of the previous block. The data held within each block
    depends on the form of blockchain. As an example, inside the Bitcoin blockchain
    system, the block holds details on the recipient, the sender, and hence the amount
    of coins. A hash is a kind of special fingerprint that has a long list of a combination
    of digits and letters. The block hash is generated with the help of a cryptographic
    hash (SHA 256) calculation. Subsequently, this enables the definition of every
    block in a blockchain network without any complications. The moment the block
    is created, it immediately absorbs the hash, while any adjustment made during
    the block always influences the difference in the hash. As a matter of theory,
    hashes help to define any changes in blocks (Fig. [9.9](#Fig9)).![../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_9_Chapter/501059_1_En_9_Fig9_HTML.png)

- en: The last component inside the block is the hash from a past block. This makes
    a succession of blocks and is the primary component behind blockchain design’s
    security. The absolute first block during a chain might be somewhat unique—all
    affirmed and approved blocks are obtained from the beginning block. Any degenerate
    endeavors incite the blocks to shift. All the resulting blocks at that point convey
    falsehood and render the whole blockchain framework invalid. On the other hand,
    in principle, it may be conceivable to manage all the blocks with the help of
    solid PC processors. In any case, an answer eliminates this chance called proof-of-work.
    This empowers a client to hamper the strategy for the production of most recent
    blocks. In Bitcoin blockchain engineering, it takes around 10 minutes to work
    out the necessary proof-of-work and add a substitution block to the chain. This
    work is finished by miners—exceptional hubs inside the Bitcoin blockchain structure.
    Miners get the opportunity to keep the exchange charges from the block that they
    checked as a payment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A new client (hub) who enters the mutual blockchain network might get a complete
    replica of the application. When a replacement block is made, it is sent to each
    hub within the blockchain network. At that point, each hub confirms the block
    and checks whether the information expressed is correct. In case it is all correct,
    the block is connected to the blockchain neighborhood of any node. All centers
    of blockchain systems have an agreement. The arrangement structure might be a
    ton of protocol guidelines, and thus once anyone submits to them, they are self-authorized
    within the blockchain. For starters, the Bitcoin blockchain illustrates an arrangement
    that agrees to declare that the trade volume will be sliced down the center for
    every 200,000 blocks. This suggests that if a block delivers a check prize of
    10 BTC, this value must be divided by 200,000 blocks. Moreover, there will be
    4 million BTC remaining to be produced, because there is a cap of 21 million BTC

    handling the devices. Notwithstanding the measure of IoT-enabled devices, there
    is a requirement for advancement that can improve this titanic volume of information
    movement inside an enormous information development run. Truth be told, the devices
    themselves will have the chance of addressing such changes over the span of activity,
    for example, an enormous swapping scale top, expanded information quality, and
    diminished latencies [[40](#CR40)]. The faster-remote arrangement procedure, especially
    the fifth generation remote (5G) systems, is an impetus for 5G-enabled IoT applications.
    This additionally permits adapting to a lot of IoT-implemented contraptions [[41](#CR41)].
    Out of the new 4G development, which uses frequencies under 6 GHz, 5G frameworks
    utilize astoundingly higher frequencies ranging from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. In addition,
    it is committed to making explicit Indus starter applications that work past the
    current versatile broadband range. This pervasive technique is the ping stone
    battle to look for more prominent transparency, which has been locked in since
    the beginning of the cell structure [[43](#CR43)]. This makes usage of the 5G
    a focal and energizing impact on the IoT movement. Thus, it supplements IoT by
    offering higher information levels, lower latencies, lower basic measures, and
    higher versatility [[44](#CR44)]. With the accelerated development of IoT advances,
    the capacity to convey considerable preferences to end-shoppers, specifically
    to clients and business ventures, has increased [[31](#CR31)]. Purchasers are
    given different organizations that depend on their activities. People will drive
    significantly more efficiently, for instance, by avoiding gridlocks and taking
    an alternate route when advised by an IoT smart driving device introduced in their
    vehicle. People can remain healthy by using wearable gadgets that offer their
    wellbeing characterized data after monitoring their physical activity and body
    parameters of the day. Associations may use client information to offer various
    types of help and items. Also, they will utilize field trackers and outer equipment

    demand from customers and businesses and the availability of more affordable devices.
    Along with the introduction of global standards, substantial operator investment
    in 5G technology, spectrum, and infrastructure are also helping to drive growth
    and increase market interest in the IoT. Today’s 5G mobile cellular networks are
    emerging from current 4G networks, which will continue to support many instances
    of use. 5G can satisfy current requirements, such as smart energy applications,
    and foresee use cases that are still some time away, such as self-driving vehicles,
    expected to last far into the future. Mobile operators would need to ensure that
    their networks support both existing and future use case requirements as they
    address the evolution of technology. Prudent operators will manage their investments
    to ensure customers are supported as networks transition to 5G. Most cases of
    5G use can be divided into three major categories: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB),
    huge IoT, and essential communications, each with its own specifications for speed,
    bandwidth, and latency. While 4G will continue to be used for many IoT use cases
    for customers and businesses, 5G offers a variety of IoT advantages that are not
    available with 4G or other technologies. This includes the capacity of 5G to accommodate
    a large number of static and mobile IoT devices that have a wide set of service
    specifications for speed, bandwidth, and efficiency. The versatility of 5G will
    become much more important for companies requiring help for the stringent requirements
    of essential communications as the IoT evolves. 5G ultra reliability and low latency
    would allow self-driving vehicles, smart energy grids, improved factory automation,
    and other demanding applications to become reality. Cloud computing, artificial
    intelligence, and edge computing can all help control IoT generated data volumes,
    as 5G improves network bandwidth. Ultimately, more 5G upgrades, such as network
    slicing, nonpublic networks, and 5G core, would help realize the vision of a global
    IoT network, supporting a large number of linked devices with diverse demands

    include the simplicity of 5G to accommodate a large range of static and mobile
    IoT devices that have a variety of specifications for speed, bandwidth, and service
    quality. The flexibility of 5G will become even more important for enterprises
    as the IoT evolves. With much stricter efficiency criteria, 5G would enable essential
    communications. The ultra-reliability and low latency of 5G will help make it
    a reality for self-driving vehicles, smart energy systems, better factory automation,
    and other advanced applications. In this chapter, we addressed the 5G-enabled
    infrastructure, which is considered the future requirements of new applications
    and their produced data. This also incorporates a new network composed of Nano-chip,
    Millimeter Wave (mmWave), Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), Device-to-Device (D2D)
    connectivity, 5G-IoT, Machine-Type Connectivity (MTC), Wireless Network Virtualization
    Function, Wireless Software-Defined Networks (WS-DN), Advanced Spectrum Sharing
    and Interference Monitoring (Advanced SSIM), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), and
    Mobile Internet. The architecture was built on the basis of these technologies.
    The architecture is flexible, efficient, scalable, consistent, convenient, and
    able to meet high application requirements. It may also assist IoT specialists
    in the construction of more powerful and flexible IoT systems. Despite the apparent
    success of IoT and the soon-to-be-released 5G technology, the chapter discusses
    the problems that will arise with the standardization of the two technologies.
    In the midst of many possible alternatives, the chapter discusses the use of blockchain
    to solve all of these problems in the area of 5G-IoT. In the future, the end user
    will benefit from the capabilities of 5G, followed by the convergence of blockchain
    with IoT applications. Followed by the respective application architectures and

    for example, significant increase in speed, coverage, enhanced capacity, network
    energy and power, and increased bandwidth, impact across many divisions in big
    data analytics. For people who have diabetes a comprehensive sensing analysis
    is available. Many mechanisms and personalized building models using 5G smart
    diabetes testing of smart clothing and smart monitoring using smartphones and

    on providers, hospital systems, medical device companies, pharmacy companies and
    telehealth. Several key companies plan to launch 5G systems as well as 5G wireless
    networks in healthcare products. In the long term, in the healthcare sector, 5G
    will help to profoundly transform remote diagnostics and consultations. 5G enables
    the IoT to have a more powerful bandwidth combined with lower latency; 5G will
    be the main focus of technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
    in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, 5G will allow widespread deployment of

    As mentioned, several features are available in blockchain with 5G, including
    decentralized approach, immutability, allows localized availability, cost efficiency
    and security. Also, challenges regarding blockchain with 5G integration focus
    mostly on scalability of blockchain which needs improvement to deal with the high
    number of devices and each device must have a unique address. Furthermore, after
    the 5G technology is deployed worldwide, it is expected that the technology will
    allow medical professionals to be able to exchange data with patients instantaneously
    from anywhere. It is an easy way for hospital-like monitoring in patient’s homes
    similar to how intensive care units are monitored nowadays. Blockchain technology
    is perhaps the silver bullet needed for industry. The blockchain functions as
    a distributed transaction ledger for various IoT transactions. The blockchain
    platform supports and uses simple key management systems. The Ethereum platform
    is capable of managing a more fine-grained way used in many IoT devices with successful

    A cluster is formed by a fog/edge agent with a different patient member value,
    where a representative is selected to be the head of the cluster. The cluster
    head (also called the leader) is involved in running the blockchain consensus
    protocol by locking a certain amount of stake in the network. From each cluster,
    a cluster head (CH) is chosen, taking into account the member nodes’ multi-criteria.
    The selection process includes the performance characteristics of a node, its
    reputation and the stake amount. Criteria are combined to measure a fitness value
    using a decision tree. The blockchain records the information of each node regarding
    the parameters listed, and can be retrieved from the blockchain.

    a limited random time period used to distinguish waiting time for the same fitness
    of the Agent. The Agent broadcasts its identifier across the cluster since its
    waiting time expires. The other cluster members verify the estimated fitness of
    the Agent and accept their approval for this Agent. In turn, every node in a cluster
    will participate in the PoS proposed. This consensus mechanism would be less vulnerable
    to an attack of 51% from each cluster than DPoS as a leader. The rich node, such
    as PoS, is less likely to become a cluster leader, as the cluster head is not
    only selected based on the locked coin.

    with classification and regression, but is preferred to solve problems with classification.
    It is a tree-structured classification where even the internal nodes represent
    the characteristics of a dataset, the branches represent the rules of decision
    and each leaf node represents the result.

    The illustrated graph in Fig. [10.3](#Fig3) indicates that a pattern which is
    consistently lower or higher does not follow the period of block generation with
    a larger number of clusters. With a higher number of clusters, cluster heads collect
    transactions and construct blocks, with a higher number of blocks per second being
    generated. On the other hand, because of the delay in testing blocks, higher block
    generation time was also noticed for some higher cluster numbers.![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig3_HTML.png)

    the modified algorithm is compared to the standard one around. The revised algorithm
    shows a significant decrease in energy consumption compared to the regular one.
    A block is validated by a few selected safe miners in the updated one, but the
    standard one requires more than 50% node participation in the block validation
    process, resulting in higher energy consumption. Updated energy consumption remains
    almost constant for a comparable number of clusters with a greater number of nodes,
    while energy consumption tends to increase as the number of nodes within the network
    increases (Fig. [10.4](#Fig4)).![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig4_HTML.png)

    The graph in Fig. [10.5](#Fig5) illustrates that the time for the standard generation
    of blocks is greater than for the updated one. As normal, different nodes send
    their transactions to one leader node for validation, and to broadcast across
    the network, a validated block is required. The approach thus consumes higher
    energy and makes it possible to take a longer time for the block’s network-wide
    casting. In addition, some good miners are selected based on reputation, results
    and stake in the revised one, but a miner based on investment or stake alone is
    regularly nominated.![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig5_HTML.png)

    An Agent needs a certain number of data encryption segments to be obtained from
    other neighbouring Agents to form the entire secret key. This technique activates
    overhead communication when exchanging hidden keys and authenticating.![../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig7_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_10_Chapter/501059_1_En_10_Fig7_HTML.png)

    unlikely to happen because the cluster head will lose its reputation to share
    when it is detected as malicious. The consensus mechanism should select the malicious

    head of the cluster is down.

    layer, which make the eHealth software more stable and fault-sensitive. We also
    defined how to implement the Patient Agent on a 5G unit. The dedicated Patient
    Agent application is able to handle the resources of 5G network slices. A performance
    analysis has shown that the emerging eHealth program will use blockchain technology
    to process health data in near-real time. The implementation of blockchain healthcare
    technology is difficult, with vast volumes of health data constantly being transmitted
