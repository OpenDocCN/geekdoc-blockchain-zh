- en: In supply chain management the necessity for data transparency is very essential
    as it is key to create trust between retailers and customers. But data managed
    by centralized controllers face several vulnerabilities and security threats like
    data breaches, data confidentiality, and many more. Blockchain is a digital and
    distributed ledger has acquired great popularity in recent years, due to its security,
    immutability, and transparency in data. It solves many challenges like keeping
    the data secure by using cryptographic algorithms. It is a decentralized ledger
    for recording, managing, storing, and transmitting data in a peer-to-peer network.
    This paper aims to provide a brief survey on the magnification of security in
    supply chain operations using blockchain, further indicating the challenges encountered
    during the integration. The work presents a descriptive study of past literature
    on blockchain for intensifying security in supply chain operations by examining
    the features provided by blockchain technology. Further, the paper provides an
    insight into how blockchain is transforming the business by providing safe and
    automated solutions. Additionally, this paper highlights the motivation behind
    using blockchain technology in supply chain management. Further, the work investigates
    how leveraging blockchain can help in overcoming vulnerabilities and avoiding
    fraudulent activities in the traditional supply chain. Finally, the paper highlights
    the uses of the blockchain-based business and enumerates the related future research
    directions.

- en: Supply Chain Management (SCM), is the process of managing the flow of services
    and goods, from transforming raw materials into a final product reaching customers
    [[1](#CR1)]. It comprises various steps of a product life cycle and usually requires
    the cooperation of several businesses and stakeholders, which makes the supply
    chain extraordinarily complex and vulnerable too [[2](#CR2)]. Additionally, the
    complexity of the SCM increases drastically in international trading scenarios.
    Many intermediaries are involved at each stage and each activity is conducted
    according to the documents shared by the third party regulating the whole trade
    which also results in mistrust. The complexity of supply chains is aggravated
    by factors like extra delays, disruption, information distortion, lack of transparency,
    increased costs, and other uncertainties. But now due to technological transformations
    happening around the world, there are significant security driven solutions being
    implemented to optimize the SCM [[3](#CR3)].

    has been acquiring tremendous attention around SCM. Blockchain is a shared and
    decentralized ledger for recording, managing, storing, and transmitting data in
    a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network [[4](#CR4)]. It makes use of cryptographic algorithms
    forming a structure like a chain of interconnected blocks containing the data
    [[5](#CR5)]. Blockchain provides a sustainable and secure architecture for the
    operation of the supply chain. IBM, Walmart, and many other companies are investing
    heavily in this field to improve supply chain processes by harnessing the power
    of blockchain technology in various industries [[6](#CR6)]. The interest of the
    research communities is also helping blockchain technology gaining momentum in
    the last few years which is evident by a series of literature reviews [[7](#CR7)].
    Blockchain technology is inherently distributed, decentralized, and tamperproof
    making it a potential solution to address the issues in traditional SCM [[8](#CR8)].

- en: The main focus of this paper is to discuss the disruption of traditional SCM
    leading to digitization of supply chain operations which is rather more advanced
    and secure. The traditional Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) has many
    limitations like misusing the data shared between the parties, illegally sourcing
    the products, etc. Adoption of solutions powered by blockchain ensures addressing
    all these limitations and seamless flow of activities at each stage and counterfeiting
    fake transactions and reducing paperwork. The technical emphasis of this paper
    is on leveraging blockchain to enhance security, traceability, responsiveness,
    and give real-time information of the products. Studies on the application of
    blockchain in almost every industry are it the coffee manufacturing industry or
    the automotive industry, show the importance, and capabilities of blockchain technology
    to establish a sustainable, simplified yet secure supply chain management.

- en: Blockchain was invented in 2008 to serve as a public distributed ledger for
    bitcoin. Blockchain is a specific type of database, unlike the traditional relational
    database. It stores the data in the blocks which is encrypted by a digital signature
    called hash which makes it more reliable and secure, preventing the data from
    tampering in a network [[21](#CR21)]. The first block is called the genesis block
    and each block is linked together hence forming a chained structure [[22](#CR22)].
    Each of these blocks consists of the hash value of the previous block, hash of
    its own, the transaction data, and the nonce value [[23](#CR23)]. The hash value
    is an alphanumeric unique digital signature that is used to identify the block.
    These hashes are generated by using SHA-256 algorithms. Number only used once,
    also abbreviated as a nonce, is the number the blockchain miner needs to explore
    to solve the blockchain through mathematical calculations. The data stored in
    these blocks is immutable and irreversible [[24](#CR24)]. Blockchain consists
    of the nodes which are typically managed by the P2P network. These nodes strictly
    adhere to the protocol to communicate and validate the new blocks which are added
    to the blockchain. As one block is altered in the chain, it breaks the cryptographic
    links hence disrupting the complete blockchain [[25](#CR25)]. Decentralized blockchain
    has data that is immutable which means that the data is irreversible. The irreversible
    nature of blockchain is an advantage and hence making it fully transparent to
    the people in the network, which means people can easily track any information.
    The data in the blockchain can only be appended and cannot be changed or deleted.
    Blockchain has several benefits to offer; easy tracking, decentralization of data,
    low administrative costs help eliminate the vulnerabilities in the existing traditional
    systems [[26](#CR26)].

    for authentication, so this is more trustable. Although it has few drawbacks like
    transaction per second is high, this raises issues and high energy consumption.

    every process that transforms raw materials into a final product. Traditionally,
    SCM seeks to cater consumer's demands for a service or product along with the
    slightest inventory required for the retailer and producer [[4](#CR4)]. Many supply
    chain models were proposed and designed earlier during the 80 s when the term
    SCM was coined, striving to satisfy the needs of numerous manufacturing networks.
    Some of the requirements include the reduction of costs from inventories and transactions,
    eliminating bottlenecks along the supply chain due to delays in supply delivery
    and payments. It also included the creation of chains resilient to fluctuations
    due to limited primary material and poor economic condition, the traceability
    of commodities sourced in a trustful and secure way, employing of local laborers
    and producers, minimizing the transportation needs, and distribution of high-grade
    quality products for the end consumer. The supply chain binds the end-to-end movement,
    including correlated and physical flow of products, raw materials, information,
    and money. The supply chain is involved in managing the sourcing, distribution,
    production, procurement, and logistics, thus, influencing the expense of a product,
    speed-to-market, required capital, and service perception in businesses [[38](#CR38)].

- en: Blockchain technology has been an influential conversation point in the supply
    chain industry. Even today several supply chain leaders are bewildered and dubious
    about the future of launching blockchain technology in the real world. They may
    understand its scope, but implementing this technology in the real world seems
    out of reach. Due to this, supply chain executives may not apprehend that investing
    in blocks and technology is the only method to mitigate these shifts in standard
    operating procedures successfully. But the use of blockchain technology in the
    supply chain is assumed to be the end-all solution to transparency and visibility.
    The complexity of the modern supply chain is extensive but blockchain technology
    has the potential to fix problems within today’s supply chain networks. Major
    organizations, like Maersk and IBM, are struggling on creating innovative platforms
    to allow for end-to-end transparency and visibility through this technology. The
    expectation of launching technology means saving billions through the elimination
    of electronic data interchange and paper-based systems, reducing inefficiencies,
    vulnerability, inconsistency, and other major drawbacks. Products may slip between
    modes, and a large global manufacturing present exacerbates the complexity. Which
    increases the risk of purchasing counterfeit products, the “gray market”. Through
    blockchain technology, consumers can check the product they purchased, and vendors,
    merchants, and suppliers can take the same action. This increases efficiency,
    transparency, and reliability within the supply chain. Supply chain companies
    using blockchain in the supply chain can examine the chain of ownership and deliver
    an extra layer of security and guarantee, to other companies regarding the item
    in question’s value and validity. These are essential parts in supply chains that
    have a direct connection to the health of the public, such as the food, agriculture,
    and medical industries.

    activities which are termed as supply chain practices. These practices involve
    several elements that comprise every aspect of the supply chain processes; those
    include sharing of information, integration, outsourcing, customer relationships,
    postponement, supplier partnerships, and lean practices [[39](#CR39)]. SCM comprises
    various steps of a product life cycle and usually requires the cooperation of
    several businesses and stakeholders. The various stages and the types of cooperators
    in the supply chain make it a deeply interconnected network that becomes challenging
    and cumbersome to maintain and monitor. Furthermore, SCM is examined not simply
    by the specifications on keeping of records but further by the elements incorporated
    among a particular business. Due to this, several consensus algorithms and blockchain
    frameworks have been advised to address concerns in distinct products, industries,
    and businesses [[1](#CR1)]. Hence there are various surveys and innovations yet
    to be done based on different types of businesses and industries that motivate
    using blockchain as a viable option.

    such as records, ledgers, delivery details, payments, etc., into a digital format
    [[40](#CR40)]. Once the conversion process is done, these resources can be used
    to streamline and upgrade processes, eliminating the need for basic information

    to maintain clear communication channels for all parts to work cohesively. In
    terms of data transfer, each level of the system needs to receive the same report
    simultaneously. Numerous supply chain logistics businesses have achieved a certain
    level of this transparency by the use of blockchain. Blockchain provides all functions
    within a particular supply chain with access to identical information through
    a chain of data sharing. It is a technology that allows authenticated data to
    communicate between individuals without the need of a middle-man or conferred
    central party [[42](#CR42)].

    pickup are one of the major concerns for the disruption of supply chain operations
    that are running internationally. Hence blockchain helps in overcoming such issues,
    by providing encryption and validation. It ensures that your data is encrypted,
    meaning modifications in data cannot be performed. It also performs various cryptographic
    encryption to generate a cryptographic signature of a document or file. This gives
    users a gateway to ensure a file is un-tampered, without requiring them to save
    the entire data on the blockchain [[43](#CR43)]. Due to its decentralized nature,
    you can always verify file signatures across every ledger on every node in the
    network and verify that they haven’t been altered.
