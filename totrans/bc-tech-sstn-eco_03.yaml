  zh: 摘要
- en: In supply chain management the necessity for data transparency is very essential
    as it is key to create trust between retailers and customers. But data managed
    by centralized controllers face several vulnerabilities and security threats like
    data breaches, data confidentiality, and many more. Blockchain is a digital and
    distributed ledger has acquired great popularity in recent years, due to its security,
    immutability, and transparency in data. It solves many challenges like keeping
    the data secure by using cryptographic algorithms. It is a decentralized ledger
    for recording, managing, storing, and transmitting data in a peer-to-peer network.
    This paper aims to provide a brief survey on the magnification of security in
    supply chain operations using blockchain, further indicating the challenges encountered
    during the integration. The work presents a descriptive study of past literature
    on blockchain for intensifying security in supply chain operations by examining
    the features provided by blockchain technology. Further, the paper provides an
    insight into how blockchain is transforming the business by providing safe and
    automated solutions. Additionally, this paper highlights the motivation behind
    using blockchain technology in supply chain management. Further, the work investigates
    how leveraging blockchain can help in overcoming vulnerabilities and avoiding
    fraudulent activities in the traditional supply chain. Finally, the paper highlights
    the uses of the blockchain-based business and enumerates the related future research
    directions.

  zh: 1 引言
- en: Supply Chain Management (SCM), is the process of managing the flow of services
    and goods, from transforming raw materials into a final product reaching customers
    [[1](#CR1)]. It comprises various steps of a product life cycle and usually requires
    the cooperation of several businesses and stakeholders, which makes the supply
    chain extraordinarily complex and vulnerable too [[2](#CR2)]. Additionally, the
    complexity of the SCM increases drastically in international trading scenarios.
    Many intermediaries are involved at each stage and each activity is conducted
    according to the documents shared by the third party regulating the whole trade
    which also results in mistrust. The complexity of supply chains is aggravated
    by factors like extra delays, disruption, information distortion, lack of transparency,
    increased costs, and other uncertainties. But now due to technological transformations
    happening around the world, there are significant security driven solutions being
    implemented to optimize the SCM [[3](#CR3)].

  zh: 供应链管理（SCM）是指管理服务与商品的流动过程，从将原材料转化为最终产品直至送达客户手中[[1](#CR1)]。它涵盖了产品生命周期的各个阶段，通常需要多家企业和利益相关方的合作，这使得供应链变得异常复杂且脆弱[[2](#CR2)]。此外，在国际贸易场景中，SCM的复杂性大幅增加。在每个阶段都有许多中介参与，每项活动都是根据第三方监管整个贸易的共享文件进行的，这也导致了信任缺失。供应链的复杂性因额外延迟、中断、信息扭曲、缺乏透明度、成本增加和其他不确定性因素而加剧。但如今，由于全球正在发生的科技变革，为优化SCM实施了许多由安全驱动的解决方案[[3](#CR3)]。
- en: Introduced by Santoshi Nakamoto, the hype around bitcoin and blockchain technology
    has been acquiring tremendous attention around SCM. Blockchain is a shared and
    decentralized ledger for recording, managing, storing, and transmitting data in
    a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network [[4](#CR4)]. It makes use of cryptographic algorithms
    forming a structure like a chain of interconnected blocks containing the data
    [[5](#CR5)]. Blockchain provides a sustainable and secure architecture for the
    operation of the supply chain. IBM, Walmart, and many other companies are investing
    heavily in this field to improve supply chain processes by harnessing the power
    of blockchain technology in various industries [[6](#CR6)]. The interest of the
    research communities is also helping blockchain technology gaining momentum in
    the last few years which is evident by a series of literature reviews [[7](#CR7)].
    Blockchain technology is inherently distributed, decentralized, and tamperproof
    making it a potential solution to address the issues in traditional SCM [[8](#CR8)].

- en: The main focus of this paper is to discuss the disruption of traditional SCM
    leading to digitization of supply chain operations which is rather more advanced
    and secure. The traditional Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) has many
    limitations like misusing the data shared between the parties, illegally sourcing
    the products, etc. Adoption of solutions powered by blockchain ensures addressing
    all these limitations and seamless flow of activities at each stage and counterfeiting
    fake transactions and reducing paperwork. The technical emphasis of this paper
    is on leveraging blockchain to enhance security, traceability, responsiveness,
    and give real-time information of the products. Studies on the application of
    blockchain in almost every industry are it the coffee manufacturing industry or
    the automotive industry, show the importance, and capabilities of blockchain technology
    to establish a sustainable, simplified yet secure supply chain management.

- en: Blockchain was invented in 2008 to serve as a public distributed ledger for
    bitcoin. Blockchain is a specific type of database, unlike the traditional relational
    database. It stores the data in the blocks which is encrypted by a digital signature
    called hash which makes it more reliable and secure, preventing the data from
    tampering in a network [[21](#CR21)]. The first block is called the genesis block
    and each block is linked together hence forming a chained structure [[22](#CR22)].
    Each of these blocks consists of the hash value of the previous block, hash of
    its own, the transaction data, and the nonce value [[23](#CR23)]. The hash value
    is an alphanumeric unique digital signature that is used to identify the block.
    These hashes are generated by using SHA-256 algorithms. Number only used once,
    also abbreviated as a nonce, is the number the blockchain miner needs to explore
    to solve the blockchain through mathematical calculations. The data stored in
    these blocks is immutable and irreversible [[24](#CR24)]. Blockchain consists
    of the nodes which are typically managed by the P2P network. These nodes strictly
    adhere to the protocol to communicate and validate the new blocks which are added
    to the blockchain. As one block is altered in the chain, it breaks the cryptographic
    links hence disrupting the complete blockchain [[25](#CR25)]. Decentralized blockchain
    has data that is immutable which means that the data is irreversible. The irreversible
    nature of blockchain is an advantage and hence making it fully transparent to
    the people in the network, which means people can easily track any information.
    The data in the blockchain can only be appended and cannot be changed or deleted.
    Blockchain has several benefits to offer; easy tracking, decentralization of data,
    low administrative costs help eliminate the vulnerabilities in the existing traditional
    systems [[26](#CR26)].

    [[21](#CR21)]。第一个块被称为创世块，每个块都与前一个块链接在一起，形成链状结构 [[22](#CR22)]。每个块都包含前一个块的哈希值、它自己的哈希值、交易数据和非量值
    [[23](#CR23)]。哈希值是一个字母数字唯一的数字签名，用来标识区块。这些哈希值是通过使用SHA-256算法生成的。只使用一次的数字，也被称为非量值，是区块链矿工需要通过数学计算来解决区块链的数字。存储在这些块中的数据是不可变的，也是不可逆的
    [[24](#CR24)]。区块链由节点组成，这些节点通常由P2P网络管理。这些节点严格遵循协议来通信和验证添加到区块链上的新块。当区块链中的一个块被更改时，它打破了加密链接，从而打乱了整个区块链
    [[25](#CR25)]。去中心化的区块链具有不可变的数据，这意味着数据是不可逆的。区块链的不可逆性是一种优势，因此它对网络中的人来说是完全透明的，这意味着人们可以轻松地追踪任何信息。区块链中的数据只能追加，不能更改或删除。区块链提供了许多好处；易于追踪、数据去中心化、低行政成本有助于消除现有传统系统的脆弱性

    chain industry. Even today several supply chain leaders are bewildered and dubious
    about the future of launching blockchain technology in the real world. They may
    understand its scope, but implementing this technology in the real world seems
    out of reach. Due to this, supply chain executives may not apprehend that investing
    in blocks and technology is the only method to mitigate these shifts in standard
    operating procedures successfully. But the use of blockchain technology in the
    supply chain is assumed to be the end-all solution to transparency and visibility.
    The complexity of the modern supply chain is extensive but blockchain technology
    has the potential to fix problems within today’s supply chain networks. Major
    organizations, like Maersk and IBM, are struggling on creating innovative platforms
    to allow for end-to-end transparency and visibility through this technology. The
    expectation of launching technology means saving billions through the elimination
    of electronic data interchange and paper-based systems, reducing inefficiencies,
    vulnerability, inconsistency, and other major drawbacks. Products may slip between
    modes, and a large global manufacturing present exacerbates the complexity. Which
    increases the risk of purchasing counterfeit products, the “gray market”. Through
    blockchain technology, consumers can check the product they purchased, and vendors,
    merchants, and suppliers can take the same action. This increases efficiency,
    transparency, and reliability within the supply chain. Supply chain companies
    using blockchain in the supply chain can examine the chain of ownership and deliver
    an extra layer of security and guarantee, to other companies regarding the item
    in question’s value and validity. These are essential parts in supply chains that
    have a direct connection to the health of the public, such as the food, agriculture,

    not delivered on time to the right person, this gap is fulfilled by blockchain
    which is helping in vaccine distribution. IBM created a distribution network of
    blockchain and supply chain solutions to help manufacturers proactively monitor
    for unpropitious events and enhance recall management [[55](#CR55)]. It is an
    open-source blockchain platform to track safely and authenticate the lot and batch
    number level of vaccines, handling, temperature, and other histories. Distributors
    gain real-time monitoring and enhanced ability to counter supply chain disruptions.

- en: The western region of Africa, Ghana, and Ivory Coast are the mass producers
    of cocoa, which makes Africa the world's largest cocoa producer with 60% of the
    production of more than 3 million tons of cocoa but it is all done by slavery
    labor. Tony's Chocolonely a company that makes chocolate which is based in Amsterdam,
    renders a business that is helping to end modern slavery and child labor in this
    chocolate industry-based supply chain moreover to aid in creating a slavery-free
    chocolate industry. Tony's Chocolonely in association with Accenture, has developed
    and led a working prototype of a private blockchain, and its supply chain allies
    in the Ivory Coast strongly experimented with it in the field. The company engaged
    the cooperation of two of its associates in Ivory Coast, Socoopacdi, a farmer
    cooperative, along with Ocean a native tradesman, to try and examine the blockchain
    system, that includes a web app to input data, and integrate the service between
    applications, multichain blockchain, and the cloud infrastructure. Some particular
    associates were assigned with inputting data at three different steps, collection
    of the bean, buying of beans by the local trader, and local merchants selling
    beans to international traders. By this process, blockchain is helping in tracking
    each shipment of beans within the supply chain [[56](#CR56)].

- en: The importance of data and security in SCM nowadays is very important which
    leads to the rise in security concerns. Many SCM-based industries are still following
    old orthodox methods which leave them vulnerable to different kinds of interventions.
    Therefore, it is important to ensure that the exchanges and the data remain safe,
    traceable, reliable, transparent, and secure. Hence in such a network, a distributed
    and decentralized technology can provide solutions to the issues. The rise of
    the use of blockchain technology in the field of SCM has grown drastically, hence
    it is important to ensure that the exchanges and the data remain safe, transparent,
    and protected. Blockchain technology offers automation, utilizes smart contracts
    and authorized transactions moreover by default, it provides authentication, integrity,
    and transparency. In this paper, we performed a thorough survey on blockchain
    technology and its utilization in the field of SCM, in implementing enhanced security
    services such as integrity, privacy, confidentiality, provenance, and authentication
    support. We looked into the use cases and tried to identify the current supply
    chain-based security threats and investigated the security measures that are capable
    of decreasing such attacks. In the end, we discussed the advantage of using blockchain
    in the supply chain for various security purposes. For the future, we continue
    our effort to design and develop a decentralized application that eases the monitoring
    and tracking of products from source to destination which will also address the
    needs of the supply chain industry. We aim to achieve transparency and verifiability
    through our solution.
