    are made. The early adopter phase is when a large investment bank or angel fund
    normally invests due to the clear benefits shown in the earlier investment phase.
    The growth phase is a result of investments, acceptance, and value being provided.
    Also, the growth phase is when an IPO may occur, bringing in additional investments.

- en: The Linux Foundation's Certified Hyperledger Fabric Administrator (CHFA) is
    really the “star” of the Hyperledger certifications. The CHFA is a technical certification
    around Hyperledger Fabric. The exam challenges candidates to demonstrate their
    ability to build a secure Hyperledger Fabric network for commercial deployment,
    including the ability to install, configure, operate, manage, and troubleshoot
    the nodes on that network. This exam is an online, proctored, performance-based
    test that consists of a set of performance-based items and is different in the
    sense that there are actual problems to be solved at a command line. You cannot
    fake your knowledge on this easily. If your prospective hire has this certification,
    then you know they are very technically adept at Hyperledger Fabric.
