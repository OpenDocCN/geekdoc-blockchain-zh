- en: Blockchain technology is getting a growing attention from various organizations
    and researchers as it provides magical solutions to the problems associated with
    the classical centralized architecture. Blockchain, whether public or private,
    is a distributed ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions
    by decentralizing the ledger among participating users. On the other hand, the
    Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolution of the Internet which can connect
    nearly all environment devices over the Internet to share their data to create
    novel services and applications for improving our quality of life. Although the
    centralized IoT system provides countless benefits, it raises several challenges.
    Resolving these challenges can be done by integrating IoT with blockchain technology.
    To be prepared for the integration process, this chapter provides an overview
    of technical aspects of the blockchain and IoT. It started by reviewing blockchain
    technology and its main structure. Applications and challenges of the blockchain
    are also presented. This is followed by reviewing the IoT system by highlighting
    common architecture and essential characteristics. Various applications and challenges
    of the IoT system are also discussed.

- en: Before the invention of the blockchain, managing various activities and actions
    over the Internet was achieved through a centralized server to guarantee non-repudiation
    of data. A group of distributed entities could not verify transactions without
    using the centralized authority [[1]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0010). There was
    no trust between communicating parties, so a third party was needed to build the
    required trust and manage the communication process. This problem was known as
    the Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) [[2]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0015). This
    problem supposed that there were three sections of the Byzantine army waiting
    outside an enemy city and planning to attack it. The army general of each section
    was independent; however, a common course of action should be achieved to be able
    to conquer the city. The army generals' capabilities to interconnect with one
    another were only allowed through a messenger service, and there was a traitor
    who corrupts generals' actions to make sure there is no chance to make a united
    attack [[3]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0020).

    [[3]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0020)。
- en: To find a solution to the problem of Byzantine generals, the blockchain increases
    transparency and reliability by using a probabilistic approach to distribute data
    among several users of the network. Generally, blockchain is a distributed database/ledger
    of transactions used to manage a constantly increasing set of records. It provides
    an efficient way to maintain security and data integrity in which a transaction
    must be verified by the majority of participating users in the blockchain network
    to be eligible to add in the ledger [[3](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0020),[4]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0025).
    The blockchain does not use a third party to store information instead, every
    participating user in the blockchain network holds a genuine copy of the ledger.
    So, if a user has breached and added a malicious transaction, the system will
    discard it, as it should be verified by all other network users. Also, there is
    a multi-signature protection to validate each transaction, which adds another
    layer of security [[5]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0030). Therefore, injecting
    the distributed ledger with false or malicious data by an intruder or malicious
    user is significantly reduced. It is possible to happen but only if the intruder
    uses more computational power than the complete blockchain network, which is very
    rare to occur [[6]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0035).

- en: Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger of transactions used to
    manage a constantly increasing set of records. To store a transaction in the ledger,
    the majority of participating users in the blockchain network should agree and
    record their consent. A set of transactions are grouped together and allocate
    a block in the ledger, which is chained of blocks. To link the blocks together,
    each block encompasses a timestamp and hash function to the previous block. The
    hash function validates the integrity and non-repudiation of the data inside the
    block. Moreover, to keep all participating users of the blockchain network updated,
    each user holds a copy of the original ledger and all users are synchronized and
    updated with newly change [[4]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0025).

    from the cryptocurrency's perspective which does not consider the fact that the
    blockchain can be used in various applications independently. Whereas Oxford dictionary
    provides a more common definition for the blockchain. It stated “a digital ledger
    in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically

    [[10]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0055)。
- en: In addition, a broader definition for the blockchain is provided by Webopedia.
    It stated “a type of data structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions
    digitally and sharing this information across a distributed network of computers,
    creating in a sense a distributed trust network. The distributed ledger technology
    offered by blockchain provides a transparent and secure means for tracking the
    ownership and transfer of assets” [[11]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0060). This
    definition provides a more detailed description of the blockchain by highlighting
    its essential features with confirming that the blockchain is not only a distributed

    [[11]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0060)。这一定义通过突出其关键特点，详细描述了区块链，确认了区块链不仅是一种分布式技术，还是一种去中心化的环境。

    discovery of the Bitcoin. According to Pilkington [[13]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0070),
    the first notion of digital currency was invented based on a centralized server
    to avoid double-spending, which is the process of using the same bitcoins more
    than once. However, this perception failed to provide a solution for double-spending,
    anonymity and centralization problems.

    Blockchain became broadly popular after the legendary paper of Nakamoto [[6]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0035).
    He proposed substituting the classical centralized architecture with a new technique
    based on a consensus mechanism. Initially, the technology was named as blockchain

    consumption and processing time. PoS is another public consensus mechanism to
    provide a low-cost, low-energy consumption in comparison with the PoW mechanism.
    Also, it allocates the responsibility to the participant users in proportion to

- en: As said earlier, the blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger for
    maintaining the integrity of transactions. Before discussing how the blockchain
    works, let us talk about the classical ledger or centralized architecture. For
    a long time, ledgers were used as means for bankers and governments to store various
    transactions regarding land possession and other activities that require maintaining
    a record of the transaction. Maintaining and building a trust relationship between
    parties of a certain transaction were the major problem, so the bank or government
    office was used as a central authority to accomplish the required changes in the
    transactions and design contracts to define who possess what. Therefore, distinguishing
    between genuine and fake transactions are only done by the central authority.

  zh: 正如前面所说，区块链是一种去中心化和分布式分类账，用于维护交易的完整性。在讨论区块链如何工作之前，让我们先谈谈经典分类账或中心化架构。长期以来，分类账被用作银行家和政府存储关于土地所有权和其他需要记录交易的活动的手段。在一定交易的各方之间建立维护和建立信任关系是一个主要问题，所以银行或政府办公室被用作中央机构来完成交易所需的变化和设计合同来定义谁拥有什么。因此，真假交易的区分只能由中央机构完成。
- en: The ledger manager (bank or government office) built the required trust, so
    people can sell and buy without having to worry since the centralized manager
    controls the access to their information on the ledger. These ledgers are totally
    centralized in which a third-party person or organization is trusted by all users
    and has a full control over transactions management. Also, these ledgers are black-boxed
    since the ledger contents are only visible to the ledger manager.

  zh: 分类账管理者（银行或政府办公室）建立了必要的信任，所以人们可以买卖而不必担心，因为中心化管理者控制着他们在分类账上的信息访问。这些分类账是完全集中的，其中所有用户都信任第三方个人或组织，并且完全控制交易管理。此外，这些分类账是黑匣子，因为分类账内容只能被分类账管理者看到。
- en: On the other hand, blockchain provides similar functions in terms of storing
    and maintaining transactions but no third-party (ledger manager) is required.
    It solves the problem of the central authority that verifies transactions by decentralizing
    the ledger in which each participating user within the blockchain network holds
    a copy of the original ledger. In addition, any participating user can request
    to add a transaction; however, the transaction is added to the block only if the
    majority of participating users in the blockchain network verify it. An automatic
    checking is reliably done for each user to generate a fast and protected ledger
    that is significantly tamper-proof the transactions and blocks [[22]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0115).

  zh: 另一方面，区块链在存储和维护交易方面具有相似的功能，但无需第三方（分类账管理者）。它通过去中心化分类账解决了验证交易的中央权力的问题，其中区块链网络中的每个参与用户都持有原始分类账的副本。此外，任何参与用户都可以请求添加交易；然而，只有当区块链网络中的大多数参与用户验证时，交易才会被添加到区块中。对于每个用户，都会可靠地进行自动检查，生成一个快速和受保护的分类账，这个分类账具有极大的防篡改性，可以可靠地保护交易和区块[[22]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0115)。
- en: Once a transaction is verified, it will be added and linked with other transactions
    in a block, which is linked with previous blocks in the ledger through a timestamp
    and hash function. This forms chains of blocks, which create what is known as
    blockchain. Once the block is generated, all participating users in the blockchain
    network start to look for the next block by trying to solve the complex mathematical
    function and generate a genuine encrypted block of transactions to add it to the
    ledger. This process is called mining, in which all users (minors) compete to
    generate the new block. The first minor to generate a genuine block and add it
    to the ledger is rewarded with the sum of fees for its transactions. Fees are
    applied to each transaction. Since blocks involve a large number of transactions
    which are added repeatedly, minors could collect multiple fees.

  zh: 一旦交易被验证，它将被添加到一个区块中，并与其他交易链接在一起。该区块通过时间戳和哈希函数与分类账中的先前区块链接在一起。这形成了一系列区块，创造了所谓的区块链。一旦区块生成，区块链网络中的所有参与用户开始寻找下一个区块，尝试解决复杂的数学函数，并生成一个真正的加密交易区块，将其添加到分类账中。这个过程被称为挖矿，所有用户（矿工）都竞争生成新的区块。第一个生成真实区块并将其添加到分类账中的矿工将获得交易费的总和作为奖励。交易费适用于每笔交易。由于区块包含大量重复添加的交易，矿工可以收取多笔交易费。
- en: The ledger held by all participating users in the network is updated once a
    novel block is added. If the newly added block has been verified by all participating
    users and all its transactions are genuine, the block will be added and remains
    permanently in the ledger as a public record. If a conflict is discovered, the
    block will be discarded. Corrupting a classical ledger needs an attack on the
    third party (centralized manager). While the blockchain is immutable, so if there
    is a malicious attempt to alter the contact of any transaction, this will need
    repeated computations of PoW for the involved block and all other blocks afterward.
    These calculations are very difficult to accomplish unless most of the users in
    the blockchain network are malicious. Also, the possibility of having a fake ledger
    does not exist since all participating users have their own genuine copy of the
    ledger to compare with [[23]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0120).

    for all people; however, the traditional paper ballot system of voting faces several
    issues. For instance, the system cannot be automated, and people have to physically
    go to the venues where the ballot boxes are kept which make them wait in lines
    for long times. Also, counting the votes takes a long time and the election can
    be breached by inserting bogus ballot papers. Also, the cost and amount of papers
    wasted in the operation are very high [[28]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0145).

    can be much simpler and save the huge cost wasted in the classical paper ballot
    voting system. The voter can create a block, which is their vote, so once the
    vote is done, anyone can verify whether the signature is valid or not and make
    sure that none of the votes has been tampered with.

    ledger. These transactions are increasing every day. To validate a transaction,
    each user has to store it on the ledger to examine the source of the existing
    transaction. Moreover, creating a block faces several constraints regarding time
    and size. For example, Bitcoin can only create almost seven transactions per second,
    which cannot realize the processing needs of billions of transactions in real-time
    applications [[21]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0110). Also, the size of a transaction
    plays an important role in the execution order since minors prefer to generate
    blocks with large transaction size and high transaction fees. This leads to more
    latency for small transactions. Some research studies suggested solutions to the
    scalability issue. For instance, Bruce [[29]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0150)
    proposed a storage optimization method for the blockchain to delete old transaction
    records from the ledger. However, more research is needed to address this challenge.'

    guarantee transactions'' privacy. Also, J. Barcelo indicated that the user''s

    to what is known now. The IoT notion starts in 1982 when four students from Carnegie
    Mellon University invented the ARPANET-connected coke machine to indicate whether
    drinks contained in the coke machine are cold or not. Their main idea was to count
    how many coke bottles had remained in each row and for how long. If the loaded
    bottle is left for a long time in the machine, it is labeled “cold.” All this
    data was then remotely available to customers via a finger interface. This experiment
    had inspired a lot of inventors all over the world to create their own connected
    appliance [[34]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0175).

    (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) that covers wider distance and provides
    faster data transfer. Although IBM performed few pilot experiments, it never commercialized
    this new technology. In the mid-1990s, IBM has suffered from tough financial problems
    which make them sell their patent to Intermec, a barcode system provider. Several
    applications are built using Intermec RFID systems, but due to the high cost of
    this technology at this time and low capacities of sales, this technology did

    Sarma, have proposed using RFID tags to track products through the supply chain.
    Their proposal was essentially to use only the tag's serial number to track products
    to save costs, since producing a more complicated chip with a large memory storage
    will be more expensive. Data linked with the RFID tag was kept in a database that
    can be accessed over the Internet [[36]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0185).

    a new evolution of the Internet. It enables different objects and devices in the
    environment to be connected over the Internet. With the help of sensors and actuators,
    it collects meaningful information from these objects/devices to improve human
    productivity and efficiency. The integration of the IoT with blockchain should
    be the next stage of developments. To be ready for this integration, this chapter
    presented a discussion of the technical aspects of blockchain and IoT. It started
    by providing a review of the blockchain technology. Applications and challenges
    of the blockchain are also discussed. This is followed by providing an overview
    of the IoT system including its common architecture and essential characteristics.
