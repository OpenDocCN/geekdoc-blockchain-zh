- en: Blockchain technology is getting a growing attention from various organizations
    and researchers as it provides magical solutions to the problems associated with
    the classical centralized architecture. Blockchain, whether public or private,
    is a distributed ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions
    by decentralizing the ledger among participating users. On the other hand, the
    Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolution of the Internet which can connect
    nearly all environment devices over the Internet to share their data to create
    novel services and applications for improving our quality of life. Although the
    centralized IoT system provides countless benefits, it raises several challenges.
    Resolving these challenges can be done by integrating IoT with blockchain technology.
    To be prepared for the integration process, this chapter provides an overview
    of technical aspects of the blockchain and IoT. It started by reviewing blockchain
    technology and its main structure. Applications and challenges of the blockchain
    are also presented. This is followed by reviewing the IoT system by highlighting
    common architecture and essential characteristics. Various applications and challenges
    of the IoT system are also discussed.

- en: Before the invention of the blockchain, managing various activities and actions
    over the Internet was achieved through a centralized server to guarantee non-repudiation
    of data. A group of distributed entities could not verify transactions without
    using the centralized authority [[1]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0010). There was
    no trust between communicating parties, so a third party was needed to build the
    required trust and manage the communication process. This problem was known as
    the Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) [[2]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0015). This
    problem supposed that there were three sections of the Byzantine army waiting
    outside an enemy city and planning to attack it. The army general of each section
    was independent; however, a common course of action should be achieved to be able
    to conquer the city. The army generals' capabilities to interconnect with one
    another were only allowed through a messenger service, and there was a traitor
    who corrupts generals' actions to make sure there is no chance to make a united
    attack [[3]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0020).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To find a solution to the problem of Byzantine generals, the blockchain increases
    transparency and reliability by using a probabilistic approach to distribute data
    among several users of the network. Generally, blockchain is a distributed database/ledger
    of transactions used to manage a constantly increasing set of records. It provides
    an efficient way to maintain security and data integrity in which a transaction
    must be verified by the majority of participating users in the blockchain network
    to be eligible to add in the ledger [[3](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0020),[4]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0025).
    The blockchain does not use a third party to store information instead, every
    participating user in the blockchain network holds a genuine copy of the ledger.
    So, if a user has breached and added a malicious transaction, the system will
    discard it, as it should be verified by all other network users. Also, there is
    a multi-signature protection to validate each transaction, which adds another
    layer of security [[5]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0030). Therefore, injecting
    the distributed ledger with false or malicious data by an intruder or malicious
    user is significantly reduced. It is possible to happen but only if the intruder
    uses more computational power than the complete blockchain network, which is very
    rare to occur [[6]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0035).

    IoT devices. This is, in turn, will reduce the costs associated with building
    and maintaining large centralized data centers. Moreover, in the absence of a

    manage a constantly increasing set of records. To store a transaction in the ledger,
    the majority of participating users in the blockchain network should agree and
    record their consent. A set of transactions are grouped together and allocate
    a block in the ledger, which is chained of blocks. To link the blocks together,
    each block encompasses a timestamp and hash function to the previous block. The
    hash function validates the integrity and non-repudiation of the data inside the
    block. Moreover, to keep all participating users of the blockchain network updated,
    each user holds a copy of the original ledger and all users are synchronized and
    updated with newly change [[4]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0025).

    as “a distributed, public ledger that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction”

    from the cryptocurrency's perspective which does not consider the fact that the
    blockchain can be used in various applications independently. Whereas Oxford dictionary
    provides a more common definition for the blockchain. It stated “a digital ledger

    discovery of the Bitcoin. According to Pilkington [[13]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0070),
    the first notion of digital currency was invented based on a centralized server
    to avoid double-spending, which is the process of using the same bitcoins more
    than once. However, this perception failed to provide a solution for double-spending,
    anonymity and centralization problems.

    use a third party to control and maintain the trust between communication parties
    until Szabo at the end of 1990 invented a decentralized digital currency which
    was called bit gold. After about 10 years, Bitcoin cryptocurrency was presented.
    Blockchain became broadly popular after the legendary paper of Nakamoto [[6]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0035).
    He proposed substituting the classical centralized architecture with a new technique
    based on a consensus mechanism. Initially, the technology was named as blockchain
    as two words “block” and “chain”; however, by 2016, two words are combined into
    one word to be what we all know now blockchain [[14]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0075).

    consumption and processing time. PoS is another public consensus mechanism to
    provide a low-cost, low-energy consumption in comparison with the PoW mechanism.
    Also, it allocates the responsibility to the participant users in proportion to
    the number of virtual currency tokens held by it. However, this derives a downside
    as it encourages crypto-coin saving, instead of spending it [[16]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0085).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As said earlier, the blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger for
    maintaining the integrity of transactions. Before discussing how the blockchain
    works, let us talk about the classical ledger or centralized architecture. For
    a long time, ledgers were used as means for bankers and governments to store various
    transactions regarding land possession and other activities that require maintaining
    a record of the transaction. Maintaining and building a trust relationship between
    parties of a certain transaction were the major problem, so the bank or government
    office was used as a central authority to accomplish the required changes in the
    transactions and design contracts to define who possess what. Therefore, distinguishing
    between genuine and fake transactions are only done by the central authority.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ledger manager (bank or government office) built the required trust, so
    people can sell and buy without having to worry since the centralized manager
    controls the access to their information on the ledger. These ledgers are totally
    centralized in which a third-party person or organization is trusted by all users
    and has a full control over transactions management. Also, these ledgers are black-boxed
    since the ledger contents are only visible to the ledger manager.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, blockchain provides similar functions in terms of storing
    and maintaining transactions but no third-party (ledger manager) is required.
    It solves the problem of the central authority that verifies transactions by decentralizing
    the ledger in which each participating user within the blockchain network holds
    a copy of the original ledger. In addition, any participating user can request
    to add a transaction; however, the transaction is added to the block only if the
    majority of participating users in the blockchain network verify it. An automatic
    checking is reliably done for each user to generate a fast and protected ledger
    that is significantly tamper-proof the transactions and blocks [[22]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0115).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a transaction is verified, it will be added and linked with other transactions
    in a block, which is linked with previous blocks in the ledger through a timestamp
    and hash function. This forms chains of blocks, which create what is known as
    blockchain. Once the block is generated, all participating users in the blockchain
    network start to look for the next block by trying to solve the complex mathematical
    function and generate a genuine encrypted block of transactions to add it to the
    ledger. This process is called mining, in which all users (minors) compete to
    generate the new block. The first minor to generate a genuine block and add it
    to the ledger is rewarded with the sum of fees for its transactions. Fees are
    applied to each transaction. Since blocks involve a large number of transactions
    which are added repeatedly, minors could collect multiple fees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ledger held by all participating users in the network is updated once a
    novel block is added. If the newly added block has been verified by all participating
    users and all its transactions are genuine, the block will be added and remains
    permanently in the ledger as a public record. If a conflict is discovered, the
    block will be discarded. Corrupting a classical ledger needs an attack on the
    third party (centralized manager). While the blockchain is immutable, so if there
    is a malicious attempt to alter the contact of any transaction, this will need
    repeated computations of PoW for the involved block and all other blocks afterward.
    These calculations are very difficult to accomplish unless most of the users in
    the blockchain network are malicious. Also, the possibility of having a fake ledger
    does not exist since all participating users have their own genuine copy of the
    ledger to compare with [[23]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0120).

    contains information regarding his financial transfer transaction. After creating
    the block, it broadcasted between all participating users in the blockchain network
    to verify it. When the new block is verified by all participating users in the
    network, the block will be added to the ledger and the transfer operation will
    be completed. At last User B can receive the money.'

    ledger. These transactions are increasing every day. To validate a transaction,
    each user has to store it on the ledger to examine the source of the existing
    transaction. Moreover, creating a block faces several constraints regarding time
    and size. For example, Bitcoin can only create almost seven transactions per second,
    which cannot realize the processing needs of billions of transactions in real-time
    applications [[21]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0110). Also, the size of a transaction
    plays an important role in the execution order since minors prefer to generate
    blocks with large transaction size and high transaction fees. This leads to more
    latency for small transactions. Some research studies suggested solutions to the
    scalability issue. For instance, Bruce [[29]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0150)

    of objects in the environment, not just computers. These objects can act intelligently
    and exchange data with other devices with negligible human involvement. Although
    the popularity of the IoT system and high acceptance of this new technology globally,
    a precise definition does not exist. There are various definitions that focus
    on a specific view of the IoT. We will try to provide common definitions of the
    IoT from different perspectives [[39]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0200).

    interoperable information and communication technologies” [[40]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0205).
    While the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) describes the IoT as “Internet of
    Things denotes a trend where a large number of embedded devices employ communication
    services offered by the Internet protocols. Many of these devices, often called
    ‘smart objects,’ are not directly operated by humans, but exist as components

    it use different communication networking protocols [[71]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0360).
    Implementing a networking protocol for the IoT should be built with taking consideration
    of system performance and usability. This is because the network protocol has
    a major impact on the behavior of the network. So, choosing the appropriate networking
    protocol is an issue that needs to be addressed. Furthermore, selecting the appropriate
    network topology for the protocol is another challenge [[59]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0300).

    Although the interconnection of IoT heterogeneous devices allows sharing their
    information which results in creating novel services, it comes at a price. As
    the acceptance of the IoT system increased and the number of connected objects
    and networks expands, the interoperability becomes a fundamental priority to interconnect

    signifies the system capability to deal with the potential growth of the system
    in an efficient manner without affecting the system performance. Being scalable
    is a mandatory operation for the IoT system to satisfy the varying requirements
    since people interest varies with time and environmental situations [[75]](S0065245818300664.xhtml#bb0380).

- en: Recently, blockchain technology has received widespread attention. It has the
    potential to be involved in almost every industry even if it still in the first
    stage of approval and still multiple challenges need to be addressed. Blockchain
    refers to a tamper-proof distributed ledger which enables transactions to be executed
    in a decentralized environment. It has the capability to solve the main problems
    of the traditional centralized model. On the other hand, the IoT has emerged as
    a new evolution of the Internet. It enables different objects and devices in the
    environment to be connected over the Internet. With the help of sensors and actuators,
    it collects meaningful information from these objects/devices to improve human
    productivity and efficiency. The integration of the IoT with blockchain should
    be the next stage of developments. To be ready for this integration, this chapter
    presented a discussion of the technical aspects of blockchain and IoT. It started
    by providing a review of the blockchain technology. Applications and challenges
    of the blockchain are also discussed. This is followed by providing an overview
    of the IoT system including its common architecture and essential characteristics.
    In addition, various applications and challenges of the IoT system were presented.
