    your market, and your society. Those choices naturally contain conflicting elements,
    as we’ve discussed at various points in this book.

  zh: 您需要为区块链在您的组织、市场和社会中的发展做出选择。这些选择自然包含相互冲突的元素，正如我们在本书的各个部分所讨论的那样。
- en: On the one hand, blockchain has been touted as a revolutionary technology to
    reengineer business processes. On the other, the real business of blockchain creates
    new markets, industries, types of customer and shapes societal engagement with
    new organizational models.

  zh: 一方面，区块链被吹捧为革命性技术，可以重塑业务流程。另一方面，区块链的真正业务创造了新的市场、行业、客户类别，并塑造了新的组织模式与社会参与。
- en: On the one hand, enterprises are deploying blockchain in an atmosphere of centralized
    control. On the other, the real business of blockchain demands decentralization
    of governance, economics, and technology.

  zh: 一方面，企业在中心化控制的氛围中部署区块链。另一方面，区块链的真正业务要求在治理、经济和技术方面实现去中心化。
- en: On the one hand, you have risen in your career within a market (and likely an
    organization) with clear hierarchal lines. On the other, the real business of
    blockchain drives growth by enabling economic agents to act autonomously in a
    consensus-driven environment.

  zh: 一方面，您在一个市场（很可能是一个组织）中的职业生涯有清晰的等级线。另一方面，区块链的真正业务通过使经济主体在共识驱动的环境中能够自主行动来推动增长。
- en: On the one hand, societies around the world have experienced a widespread dissolution
    of citizen trust in public institutions. On the other, the real business of blockchain
    encourages experimentation with new social contracts and new ways to engage and
    participate.

  zh: 一方面，世界各地的社会经历了对公共机构公民信任的普遍溶解。另一方面，区块链的真正业务鼓励尝试新的社会契约和新的参与方式。
- en: On the one hand, the use of AI increases opacity on who controls the business
    currencies (i.e., data, access, contracts, and technology). On the other, the
    real business of blockchain provides transparency over smart-machine-based activity
    and clarifies value exchanges and accountability.

  zh: 一方面，人工智能的使用增加了谁控制商业货币（即数据、访问、合同和技术）的不透明度。另一方面，区块链的真正业务提供了对基于智能机器的活动的透明度，并澄清了价值交换和责任。
- en: The list of contrasting aims goes on. The biggest difference of all exists in
    the space between observation and action—between your desire to learn all you
    can and the need to jump in and experiment for yourself to find blockchain’s strategic
    value. In matters of technology, you’re likely to have a strong instinct to wait
    and see what others do before you make an investment. Received wisdom among enterprise
    leaders has long held that so-called type B companies—those that wait to invest
    until pioneers have proven the value of a new technology—usually have the best
    position.[¹](../Text/notes.html#bm001-en1) They are supposedly early enough to
    benefit from some market differentiation, but they avoid the risks absorbed by
    early adopters.

  zh: 对比目标的列表还在继续。最大的区别存在于观察和行动之间的空间——在你渴望尽可能学到更多知识的愿望与亲自跳入实验以找到区块链战略价值之间。在技术事务上，你可能会有强烈的直觉，在你进行投资之前等待看看别人做了什么。长期以来，企业领导者之间的共识一直是，所谓的B型公司——那些等到先锋证明了新技术的价值才投资的公司——通常处于最佳位置。[¹](../Text/notes.html#bm001-en1)
    他们据说足够早就能从一些市场差异中获益，但他们避免了早期采用者所承担的风险。
- en: The type B strategy may have worked in the past. But it won’t be as effective
    as we move toward the programmable society. The business currencies of data, access,
    technology, and contracts accelerate winner-take-all dynamics. The organizations
    that control these currencies earn an outsize share of the revenues that flow
    through a market. These four currencies also define the terms of engagement for
    customers, including smart machines and other businesses.

  zh: B型策略在过去可能有效。但在我们向可编程社会迈进时，它将不会像以前那样有效。数据、获取、技术和合同这四种业务货币加速了取胜者通吃的动态。控制这些货币的组织会赚取流经市场的收入的超额份额。这四种货币也定义了顾客、包括智能机器和其他企业的参与条款。
- en: The stakes are high in defining a new economic and social model that breaks
    the hold central actors have over the currencies and that replaces our winner-take-all
    scenario with a more decentralized, more accessible, more transparent, and fairer
    alternative. Embracing the real business of blockchain requires not just a vision
    and new technology skills. Organizations must also evolve toward new organizational
    models that redefine leadership, enterprise culture, and working practices. Those
    who wait until blockchain technology matures are guaranteed higher opportunity
    costs levied from both sides. Thousands of blockchain-native startups will swarm
    to dilute the competitive capability of type B companies, and centralized powers
    will keep pushing to maintain their positions.

  zh: 在定义一个打破中心角色对货币的控制并用更分散、更可访问、更透明和更公平的替代方案替换我们的通吃情形的新经济和社会模式方面，风险很高。拥抱区块链真正的商业需求不仅需要愿景和新技术技能。组织还必须朝着重新定义领导力、企业文化和工作实践的新组织模式演进。那些等到区块链技术成熟的人将被双方征收更高的机会成本。成千上万的区块链原生初创公司将涌入，削弱B型公司的竞争能力，而中心化的权力将继续推动维护其地位。
- en: The window is therefore small. Market actors with a vested interest in maintaining
    centralized governance models are already pushing blockchain-inspired models as
    the market status quo. If their efforts succeed and prevent the evolution toward
    blockchain-complete solutions and enhanced blockchain, you will miss a critical
    inflection point in the evolution of digital business. Without blockchain-complete
    solutions, the millions of things emerging as economic agents will be controlled
    by a central intermediary. The AI and algorithms in development today will therefore
    convert data into predictive analytics that will benefit only a small percentage
    of the population.

  zh: 因此，这个机会窗口很小。市场参与者们对维持中心化治理模式有着既得利益，他们已经开始推动以区块链为灵感的模型作为市场现状。如果他们的努力成功，并阻止了朝着区块链完整解决方案和增强区块链的演变，你将错过数字业务演变的关键拐点。没有区块链完整解决方案，数百万个作为经济主体出现的事物将受到中央中介的控制。因此，今天正在开发的人工智能和算法将把数据转化为只有少数人受益的预测性分析。
- en: Leaders who believe that technology should benefit as many organizations and
    individuals as possible and that advanced solutions should have transparency and
    accountability cannot wait five, ten, or fifteen years to see how blockchain evolves.
    They need to define and execute now on their vision of a programmable future with
    decentralized access, influence, and value, for the benefit of all.

  zh: 领导者们相信技术应该使尽可能多的组织和个人受益，而先进的解决方案应该具有透明度和问责制，他们不能等待五年、十年或十五年来看区块链的发展。他们需要立即定义并执行自己关于可编程未来的愿景，实现去中心化的访问、影响和价值，造福于所有人。
