    your market, and your society. Those choices naturally contain conflicting elements,
    as we’ve discussed at various points in this book.

- en: On the one hand, blockchain has been touted as a revolutionary technology to
    reengineer business processes. On the other, the real business of blockchain creates
    new markets, industries, types of customer and shapes societal engagement with
    new organizational models.

- en: On the one hand, enterprises are deploying blockchain in an atmosphere of centralized
    control. On the other, the real business of blockchain demands decentralization
    of governance, economics, and technology.

- en: On the one hand, you have risen in your career within a market (and likely an
    organization) with clear hierarchal lines. On the other, the real business of
    blockchain drives growth by enabling economic agents to act autonomously in a
    consensus-driven environment.

    of citizen trust in public institutions. On the other, the real business of blockchain
    encourages experimentation with new social contracts and new ways to engage and
    participate.

    currencies (i.e., data, access, contracts, and technology). On the other, the
    real business of blockchain provides transparency over smart-machine-based activity
    and clarifies value exchanges and accountability.

- en: The list of contrasting aims goes on. The biggest difference of all exists in
    the space between observation and action—between your desire to learn all you
    can and the need to jump in and experiment for yourself to find blockchain’s strategic
    value. In matters of technology, you’re likely to have a strong instinct to wait
    and see what others do before you make an investment. Received wisdom among enterprise
    leaders has long held that so-called type B companies—those that wait to invest
    until pioneers have proven the value of a new technology—usually have the best
    position.[¹](../Text/notes.html#bm001-en1) They are supposedly early enough to
    benefit from some market differentiation, but they avoid the risks absorbed by
    early adopters.

- en: The type B strategy may have worked in the past. But it won’t be as effective
    as we move toward the programmable society. The business currencies of data, access,
    technology, and contracts accelerate winner-take-all dynamics. The organizations
    that control these currencies earn an outsize share of the revenues that flow
    through a market. These four currencies also define the terms of engagement for
    customers, including smart machines and other businesses.

- en: The stakes are high in defining a new economic and social model that breaks
    the hold central actors have over the currencies and that replaces our winner-take-all
    scenario with a more decentralized, more accessible, more transparent, and fairer
    alternative. Embracing the real business of blockchain requires not just a vision
    and new technology skills. Organizations must also evolve toward new organizational
    models that redefine leadership, enterprise culture, and working practices. Those
    who wait until blockchain technology matures are guaranteed higher opportunity
    costs levied from both sides. Thousands of blockchain-native startups will swarm
    to dilute the competitive capability of type B companies, and centralized powers
    will keep pushing to maintain their positions.

    centralized governance models are already pushing blockchain-inspired models as
    the market status quo. If their efforts succeed and prevent the evolution toward
    blockchain-complete solutions and enhanced blockchain, you will miss a critical
    inflection point in the evolution of digital business. Without blockchain-complete
    solutions, the millions of things emerging as economic agents will be controlled
    by a central intermediary. The AI and algorithms in development today will therefore
    convert data into predictive analytics that will benefit only a small percentage
    of the population.

- en: Leaders who believe that technology should benefit as many organizations and
    individuals as possible and that advanced solutions should have transparency and
    accountability cannot wait five, ten, or fifteen years to see how blockchain evolves.
    They need to define and execute now on their vision of a programmable future with
    decentralized access, influence, and value, for the benefit of all.
