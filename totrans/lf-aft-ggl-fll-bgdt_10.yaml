    of Thiel himself, Strachman and Gibson ran the Thiel Fellowship for its first
    five years. Founded in 2011 to pluck young people from the cradle of credentialism,
    the Fellowship induces students in their early twenties or below to “skip or stop
    out of college.” While they work on their own “unique project, they receive a
    [two-year] $100,000 grant and support from the Thiel Foundation’s network of founders,
    investors, and scientists.”[¹](notes.html#ch10note-1)

    technologists reshape the incumbent system of the world. Birthed in the fogs of
    Stanford, hosted in the clouds of Google, and aiming at superhuman artificial
    intelligence, that system exalts academic honors, all-purpose Turing machines,
    software supremacy, open-source modularity, and secret-sauce integration. But
    do you really trust this system to handle your money, motivate your children,
    shape your worldview, or maneuver your car through a crowded parking lot?

    when he learned that his boss was launching an “anti–Rhodes Scholarship.” “Sign
    me up,” Gibson said. Post-graduate fellowships for Americans and other colonials
    to get polished at Oxford, Rhodes Scholarships are the ultimate establishment
    honor. They tend to produce politicians like Bill Bradley, media celebrities such
    as Rachel Maddow, and academics rather than entrepreneurs.

    charter school in San Diego. She already believed that many students could learn
    far more starting their own companies than sitting in classrooms. When she heard
    about the Thiel Fellowship, originally called “20 under 20,” she joined Gibson
    there. They picked their first group of twenty under twenty in 2011\. The next
    year an eighteen-year-old freshman at Canada’s University of Waterloo, Vitalik
    Buterin, applied.

    unimpressive. “At the outset,” says Strachman, “we were seeing lots of education
    projects; his didn’t stand out.” They passed him over, and he didn’t reapply.
    But that year they did choose his high school classmate and friend Chris Olah,
    a nineteen-year-old graphics virtuoso.

    software jam session, held every September at Waterloo, where he met Strachman
    and Gibson. In his upward-inflecting, faintly lisping tones, Buterin told them
    that since his application, he had changed course a bit, having fallen in love
    with “this cryptographic construction called a blockchain.” He had devoted himself
    to studying its possibilities, using the bitcoins he’d earned from founding Bitcoin
    Magazine to travel the world from Israel to Las Vegas to Amsterdam, talking with
    other blockchain obsessives. Realizing that “crypto projects were taking up thirty
    hours per week of my time,” he dropped out of university in April 2013.[²](notes.html#ch10note-2)

    attention before he transgressed into his over-the-hill twenties, Buterin proposed
    to revolutionize the Internet and the global financial system. “That’s what Peter
    Thiel wanted, right?” As he recited a litany of ambitiously cockeyed schemes—“Turing-complete”
    blockchains, new software languages, currencies, computer platforms, smart contracts—Strachman
    and Gibson could see that he was a genius. But his grandiosity and apparent lack
    of focus defied all the rules of successful enterprise.

    white paper, and on June 5, 2014, Peter Thiel announced a new group of twenty
    Thiel Fellows, which included Buterin. A year later, Ethereum went live, with
    the announcement, “What bitcoin does for payments, Ethereum does for anything
    that can be programmed.” It was another step in the decentralization of the Internet.

    company founders.

    31, 1517\. That was the day that Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses on
    the church door at Wittenberg. Among the abuses Luther was protesting was the
    selling of indulgences. The remission of the temporal penalty due to sins, an
    indulgence, like other spiritual goods, must not be sold. The pardoners who perpetrated
    this abuse would issue a document memorializing the transaction. The 1517 Fund
    explains the parallel: “Likewise, universities today are selling a piece of paper
    at great cost and telling people that buying it is the only way they can save
    their souls. Universities call it a diploma, and they’re making a fortune doing
    it. Call us heretical if you like, but the 1517 Fund is dedicated to dispelling
    that paper illusion.”[³](notes.html#ch10note-3)'

    through the brindled meadows of Portola Valley and far up the Old Spanish Trail
    to the locked gate of Number 495\. This is the site of Jacques Littlefield’s famous
    five-hundred-acre Pony Tracks Ranch. When Littlefield, the heir to a construction
    fortune, died in 2014, his collection of 220 rare and exotic tanks—“enough mechanized
    weaponry to invade a small country” as the San Jose Mercury News reported at the
    time—was auctioned off.[⁴](notes.html#ch10note-4) What remained at his ranch was

    to Google in Mountain View. On clear days you can glimpse the towers of San Francisco.

    of Luminar, the company begun in 2012 by Austin Russell, a wunderkind engineer
    and 2013 Thiel Fellow. At the time of the 1517 Fund’s annual meeting in 2017,
    Luminar had 250 employees in Silicon Valley and Orlando, Florida, and was adding
    a new chip design facility in Colorado. About to emerge from five years of “deep
    stealth” development, it was announcing unique new lidar (laser-radar) chips,
    orders of magnitude better than the competition from Google and others, which
    provide the core vision capability for self-driving cars.

    Luminar at age seventeen and ranks with Buterin as the Thiel Fellow most capable
    of launching a reformation. While Buterin is unleashing a new global architecture
    for computing and finance, Russell is launching a revival of U.S. innovation in
    manufacturing hardware. Defying the frenzied hype of its software-based rivals
    in the self-driving sweepstakes, from Google to Tesla, Luminar’s product is comparable
    in its transformative reach and ambition to Henry Ford’s early-twentieth-century
    assembly lines at River Rouge in Detroit. Software will not end up eating everything

    Russell, whose parents were denying him a mobile phone. He responded by transforming
    his Nintendo gaming portable into a WiFi phone and followed up with inventions

    been losing a national robotics competition as the fifteen-year-old leader of
    his high school team.

    introduced his son to bitcoin, and Robert Russell, now CFO of Luminar, pushed
    Austin ahead in optics. Like Buterin, Russell is not cowed by the powerful forces

- en: Looking at Google’s Waymo, Elon Musk’s Tesla, Levandowsky’s Uber scheme, and
    the host of imitator “autonomy” projects, Russell sees over-hyped schemes that
    cannot ultimately succeed. They can sue each other all they want, but the approach
    of the most highly vaunted ventures is to try to enhance the existing lidar, radar,
    and camera systems with artificial intelligence, big data, mapping, and software.
    Russell, who spent his boyhood preoccupied with optics, lasers, and machine vision,
    understands that no amount of big data can make up for bad data from hopelessly
    inadequate vision systems.

- en: Lidar (light detection and ranging) is how vehicles see and evaluate the world
    around them. Russell understood from the outset that if the car cannot deliver
    an utterly reliable real-time image and interpretation of the road ahead for at
    least two hundred meters in the dark, with just 10 percent reflectivity, it is
    a death-trap. Two hundred meters give a car seven seconds to react, compared with
    the one or two seconds afforded by existing systems, if they can register the
    objects at all.

- en: Such systems are worse than useless, Russell thinks, because they produce an
    illusion of success by meeting the low-cost targets and performance specs hyped
    by the industry. Like Google’s Waymo vehicles, they could perform adequately on
    repetitive twenty-five-mile-an-hour commutes from Silicon Valley to San Francisco.
    Answering Elon Musk’s complaints about regulation, Russell said prophetically
    in early 2017, “The real threat is premature launch of systems that end up killing
    people and killing the industry.” He added, “For existing technology, it may even
    be underregulated.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To Russell, it is obvious that autonomy is not chiefly a software problem. Most
    existing software will have to be changed anyway to adapt to faster and better
    lidar systems. Much of the work already done by Waymo and others will have to
    be redone. Hardware is the gating factor. Nearly all of Russell’s competitors
    use existing devices—all of them inadequate—from companies such as Velodyne and
    Quanergy.

    the original DARPA competition that launched the industry. These approaches still
    entail a “paint-can” on the roof with sixty-four lasers and photo-detectors in
    rows. Velodyne’s idea of how to improve performance is to double the number of
    lasers to 128 and add more software. It all strikes Russell as a kludge—a system
    too complex and cumbersome to work.

    modularity.” When a product fundamentally underperforms the market’s requirements,
    integration is essential. You can’t just go down to Fry’s and cobble together
    existing devices. Every interface must be optimized. Modularity—interconnecting
    standard components from a variety of suppliers—works only when the product easily
    fulfills the function, leaving tolerances for less than top performance.

- en: To Russell, it is obvious that current self-driving vision systems are nowhere
    near the level the market requires. As bad as human drivers are, the self-driving
    systems of 2017 had to be turned off or augmented far more often than human drivers
    failed. The best record by far is Google’s Waymo, but it has to be disengaged
    every 5,500 miles or so, compared with nearly 500,000 miles for human drivers
    between accidents and 84.6 million miles per fatality. Tesla has to be turned
    off every three miles. Sure, these systems will get better with time. But they’re
    nowhere close to where they need to be. Although you would never know it by listening
    to the promotional literature, the existing vision systems cannot collect enough
    good data fast enough. Fancy software just gilds that rotating sow’s ear on the
    roof.

    entirely new integrated systems with at least fiftyfold more resolution and tenfold
    more range than the prevailing standard. Russell’s technology targets were not
    “inevitable.” They did not spring from Darwinian trends in the Valley. It would
    require, in Russell’s words, relentless “top-down planning and bottom-up engineering.”

    a system that kills people. Aim at performance, and low cost will follow. Aim
    at low cost, and you will not achieve sufficient performance to have an enduring
    business. After a sufficient system is devised, demand will foster economies of
    scale and learning curves that bring the price down over time.

    Jason Eichenholz of Open Photonics to fill out his company, Russell eventually
    raised $36 million from 1517 and other investors. Throwing out the conventional
    wisdom about lidar, his team researched two thousand different ways to build a
    fundamentally more effective system. In 2013, they decided to make a drastic change
    in the prevailing practice.

    nanometers—which is close to the visible spectrum and can simulate what can be
    seen by human eyes. Unfortunately, the 905 nanometer near-infrared also can affect
    human eyes. So Russell moved deeper into the infrared band to 1,550 nanometers
    (153 terahertz), which is employed in fiber optics. The longer wavelength can
    be used at sixtyfold greater power levels without endangering human beings. Russell
    and the team also radically changed the architecture. Rather than using scores
    of lasers, they raster-scan the scene thousands of times a second with a single
    laser, like the device in a cathode-ray tube television.

    TowerJazz Semiconductor. Headquartered in Israel and headed by the visionary entrepreneur
    Russell Ellwanger, TowerJazz happens to run a world-beating analog-digital fabrication
    facility (a “fab”) in Austin Russell’s hometown of Newport Beach. After making

    After becoming a Thiel Fellow in 2013, Russell found his community. He moved into
    216 Park Lane, a stucco mansion on a palmy drive in Atherton, a few miles north
    of Stanford. While real estate agents tried to sell the property for ten million
    dollars in the wake of the “Great Recession,” the eighteen-year-old Californian
    rented the secluded space with two other youths engaged with the Thiel program—the
    twenty-three-year-old Vermonter Stephen Balaban, a graduate of the University
    of Michigan, and the seventeen-year-old Thomas Sohmers, from Massachusetts. The
    trio looked an entrepreneurial version of the Hardy Boys, heroes of the classic
    mystery books—with Russell as the tall, ping-pong-playing, blond Joe Hardy; Balaban
    as his dark-haired intellectual martial-artist older brother, Frank Hardy; and
    Sohmers as Chet Morton, their slightly chubby friend whose tinkering and inventions
    often save the day.

    anyway, not as a student but as an expert brought in to teach Russell’s ex-classmates.
