- en: And why should others believe you? Blockchain uses an algorithm proof mechanism
    to secure the trust. With the help of Blockchain, every node in the system can
    exchange data automatically and securely in a trusted environment. Compared with
    other technologies that can be very costly and time-consuming, Blockchain has
    the advantage of real-time matching, automatic operation, compulsory execution,
    and low cost.

    credibility as independent entities instead of being controlled by the government

    has various independent nodes on the network, each containing a copy of the backup

    not formulate any policy; it merely acts as a notary and government tool to establish
    and implement policies. Blockchain helps governments’ policies to be accepted
