- en: Once the widespread potential of Blockchain was understood, people began to
    see their life through the lens of this technology. With Blockchain you can solve
    this problem, with Blockchain you can solve that…Blockchain as the panacea to
    all our problems. This was – and I would say that in some cases it is still –
    the attitude of innovators and early adaptors when asked what they think about
    Blockchain. This euphoria was reflected in the price of Bitcoin, touching US$20,000
    in December 2017, with US$7.4 billion raised by start-ups though token sales in
    2017 alone.

  zh: 一旦人们理解了区块链的广泛潜力，人们就开始用这种技术的视角来看待自己的生活。有了区块链，你可以解决这个问题，有了区块链，你可以解决那个问题……区块链是我们所有问题的灵丹妙药。当被问及他们对区块链的看法时，创新者和早期采用者持有这种态度——我可以说，在某些情况下，这种态度仍然存在。这种狂喜反映在比特币的价格上，2017年12月触及19,000美元的高点，仅2017年通过代币销售就筹集了74亿美元。
- en: Then, someone began to realize that perhaps moving ‘from theory to practice’
    in Blockchain still has a long way to go. Indeed, Bitcoin – which was expected
    by the ‘maximalists’ to supplant VISA or Mastercard – is capable of supporting
    only around seven transactions per second. Visa's network can handle about 24,000
    transactions a second. Hopes are high, but so too are the obstacles. Scalability,
    limited consumer adoption, regulatory uncertainty, and a lack of standards are
    just a few of the many challenges that are hindering the mass adoption of digital
    currencies and Blockchain.[¹](#fbetw04-note-0001)

  zh: 然后，有人开始意识到，在区块链领域实现“从理论到实践”的转变可能还有很长的路要走。的确，比特币——被“极端主义者”预期会取代VISA或Mastercard——每秒只能支持大约七笔交易。VISA的网络每秒可以处理大约24,000笔交易。期望很高，但障碍也不小。可扩展性、消费者采用率有限、监管不确定性以及缺乏标准等问题，只是阻碍数字货币和区块链大规模应用的众多挑战中的几个。[¹](#fbetw04-note-0001)
- en: According to the technology life cycle, we have just exited the Embryonic phase,
    characterized by hype and overexcitement, and we are now into the era of Ferment,
    with its technology variations, rivalry and competition, and technical uncertainty
    in which user preferences are not clear. Indeed, if you asked me how many Blockchains
    have so far been implemented and do actually exist I would have some difficulty
    in providing the exact figure. New Blockchains enter the market every day. We
    can say that there are roughly fifty different consensus mechanisms (the engine
    of the blockchain) and about two thousand unique tokens and digital currencies.
    And there are still other, proprietary Blockchains which are tokenless and often
    private.

  zh: 根据技术生命周期，我们刚刚离开了充满炒作和过度兴奋的胚胎期，现在进入了发酵期，这个时期有技术变体、竞争和不确定性，用户偏好不明确。事实上，如果你问我到目前为止已经实施并实际存在的区块链有多少个，我将很难提供确切的数字。新的区块链每天都在市场上出现。我们可以说是大约有五十种不同的共识机制（区块链的引擎）和大约两千种独特的代币和数字货币。还有其他专有的、通常私有的无代币区块链。
- en: Each new Blockchain promises better throughput, higher levels of security, more
    privacy. In this complex space it is very difficult to differentiate accurately
    and to assess the quality of each technological component. What is generally needed
    is a Blockchain matrix or analytical framework.[²](#fbetw04-note-0002)

- en: According to the Gartner Hype Cycle model we are ‘sliding into the trough of
    disillusionment’ where companies become impatient as they realize that the new
    technology is not a panacea for all their problems. Blockchain technology is characterized
    as having poor performance, slow industry adoption, and lacking a clear value
    proposition. As industry experts and the media emphasize these challenges rather
    than the opportunities of the technology, we enter into a long period in which
    companies fail to deliver on projects and investors become more prudent and risk
    adverse.

  zh: 根据Gartner炒作周期模型，我们正在“滑入失望之谷”，这时公司变得不耐烦，因为他们意识到新技术并非解决所有问题的灵丹妙药。区块链技术被描述为性能不佳、行业采用缓慢，且缺乏明确的价值观。随着行业专家和媒体强调这些挑战而不是技术的机遇，我们进入了一个漫长的时期，公司无法交付项目，投资者变得更加谨慎和风险厌恶。
- en: The period of enlightenment and productive adoption of Blockchain – in which
    early adopters gain experience with the new technology, best practices emerge
    and its real-world value becomes accepted by industry – is still ahead of us.
    But we are gaining ground every day.

  zh: 区块链的启蒙和富有成效的采用阶段——早期采用者与新技术一起工作，最佳实践逐渐浮现，其实际价值被行业所接受——还在前方。但是我们每天都在取得进展。
- en: Additional steps are needed if we are to reach the critical point of mass adoption,
    as happened in the past with other innovations. In principle, a sound regulatory
    framework and the creation of common standards would boost trust in Blockchain
    technology and digital tokens, and stimulate investment. In addition, rejecting
    the hypothesis that one chain will rule them all – indeed, different communities
    of Blockchain users deserve different governing laws and different Blockchain
    protocols provide an answer to those different needs – interoperability will also
    need to be addressed to enable Blockchains to exchange information with each other.

  zh: 如果我们想要达到广泛采用的关键点，就像过去其他创新一样，还需要采取额外的步骤。原则上，一个健全的监管框架和共同标准的创建将增强对区块链技术和数字代币的信任，并刺激投资。此外，拒绝一种假设，即一条链将统治一切——实际上，不同的区块链用户社区应该有不同的治理法律，不同的区块链协议为这些不同的需求提供答案——还需要解决互操作性问题，以使区块链能够彼此交换信息。
- en: For these reasons a book that introduces well thought-out examples of strategic
    applications of Blockchain in the real world is timely and well placed to assist
    entrepreneurs, investors, and regulators to move quickly from the phase of disillusionment
    to the richly rewarding phase of productivity and adoption. *Commercializing Blockchain*
