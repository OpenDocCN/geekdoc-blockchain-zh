- en: Once the widespread potential of Blockchain was understood, people began to
    see their life through the lens of this technology. With Blockchain you can solve
    this problem, with Blockchain you can solve that…Blockchain as the panacea to
    all our problems. This was – and I would say that in some cases it is still –
    the attitude of innovators and early adaptors when asked what they think about
    Blockchain. This euphoria was reflected in the price of Bitcoin, touching US$20,000
    in December 2017, with US$7.4 billion raised by start-ups though token sales in
    2017 alone.

    in Blockchain still has a long way to go. Indeed, Bitcoin – which was expected
    by the ‘maximalists’ to supplant VISA or Mastercard – is capable of supporting
    only around seven transactions per second. Visa's network can handle about 24,000
    transactions a second. Hopes are high, but so too are the obstacles. Scalability,
    limited consumer adoption, regulatory uncertainty, and a lack of standards are
    just a few of the many challenges that are hindering the mass adoption of digital
    currencies and Blockchain.[¹](#fbetw04-note-0001)

- en: According to the technology life cycle, we have just exited the Embryonic phase,
    characterized by hype and overexcitement, and we are now into the era of Ferment,
    with its technology variations, rivalry and competition, and technical uncertainty
    in which user preferences are not clear. Indeed, if you asked me how many Blockchains
    have so far been implemented and do actually exist I would have some difficulty
    in providing the exact figure. New Blockchains enter the market every day. We
    can say that there are roughly fifty different consensus mechanisms (the engine
    of the blockchain) and about two thousand unique tokens and digital currencies.
    And there are still other, proprietary Blockchains which are tokenless and often
    private.

    privacy. In this complex space it is very difficult to differentiate accurately
    and to assess the quality of each technological component. What is generally needed
    is a Blockchain matrix or analytical framework.[²](#fbetw04-note-0002)

- en: According to the Gartner Hype Cycle model we are ‘sliding into the trough of
    disillusionment’ where companies become impatient as they realize that the new
    technology is not a panacea for all their problems. Blockchain technology is characterized
    as having poor performance, slow industry adoption, and lacking a clear value
    proposition. As industry experts and the media emphasize these challenges rather
    than the opportunities of the technology, we enter into a long period in which
    companies fail to deliver on projects and investors become more prudent and risk
    adverse.

- en: The period of enlightenment and productive adoption of Blockchain – in which
    early adopters gain experience with the new technology, best practices emerge
    and its real-world value becomes accepted by industry – is still ahead of us.
    But we are gaining ground every day.

- en: Additional steps are needed if we are to reach the critical point of mass adoption,
    as happened in the past with other innovations. In principle, a sound regulatory
    framework and the creation of common standards would boost trust in Blockchain
    technology and digital tokens, and stimulate investment. In addition, rejecting
    the hypothesis that one chain will rule them all – indeed, different communities
    of Blockchain users deserve different governing laws and different Blockchain
    protocols provide an answer to those different needs – interoperability will also
    need to be addressed to enable Blockchains to exchange information with each other.

    applications of Blockchain in the real world is timely and well placed to assist
    entrepreneurs, investors, and regulators to move quickly from the phase of disillusionment
    to the richly rewarding phase of productivity and adoption. *Commercializing Blockchain*
    aims to raise awareness of the promises and perils of Blockchain technologies

    on how the evolution of this technology has brought us to the present day – what
    has worked, what has not – to better map out where Blockchain is going next. *Commercializing
    Blockchain* is a key part of that vital discussion and will be equally useful
    to veterans of the space and to those only just beginning to discover this technology.
