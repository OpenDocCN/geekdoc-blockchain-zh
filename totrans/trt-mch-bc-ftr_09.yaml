    doing so without performing the standard, government-led “official ID” functions
    of issuing birth certificates, passports, national ID cards, and so forth. What’s

    Facebook, Google, and Twitter. These companies are now in the vital business of
    verifying the claims we make about who we are. In creating social media accounts,
    we have effectively created verifiable identities that third parties can access
    to confirm such claims—hence the growing use of SSO (single sign-on) systems for
    accessing other Web sites. How many of these new “IDs” do these tech giants manage?
    Well, Facebook’s subscribers now exceed 2 billion and Google’s are at 1.2 billion

    something about this problem after watching the Lucy Liu–produced film Meena,
    about an Indian girl kidnapped from her family and forced into prostitution. When
    he learned about the struggle to rescue ID-less children, he considered the role
    blockchain technology might play as a universal proof of identity by creating
    a global, tamper-proof registry of people’s vital information. He founded an entity
    called ID2020, named for its initial goal of establishing secure digital identities
    for all the world’s children by the year 2020\. (Its objectives would later shift
    to align with the United Nation’s sustainable development goal of official identity
    for all people by 2030.) Edge understood the problems that would need solving
    before his vision of a blockchain-based, universal identity could be achieved.
    Who would attest to the child’s identity? Who would be responsible for controlling
    and securing the private key that would be used to access the records before the
    child reached adulthood?

    differed markedly from that of government officials. To the diplomats, employed
    as they are by governments, the notion of an official, government-issued ID—a
    driver’s license, a passport, a birth certificate—was sacrosanct. They felt that
    the issuance and certification of a person’s identity was the proper role of the
    state. By contrast, the technologists, wary of state power, offered an approach
    that would become a buzzword of the conference: “self-sovereign.” This idea holds
    that individuals are better off establishing their own proofs of who they are

    that system of math-based key-pairings that, as we discussed in chapter three,
    allows users to authorize transactions within Bitcoin and other blockchains. (Public
    key cryptography, invented in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, long
    preceded Bitcoin and is widely used for security purposes in other Internet applications,
    including e-mail.) Just as public key cryptography lets Bitcoin users “sign” a
    bitcoin address (essentially, their public key) with their private key to prove
    that they control it, an institution certifying a person’s attributes can give
    authority to that certification with this same digital signatures model. This
    pairing can create an irrefutable record that, say, your university has confirmed
    you have a degree, your utility company has attested that you’ve paid your power
    bills, or a birth registrar has authenticated your birth certificate.

    attestation after it has been written into an append-only immutable ledger—much

    our outward-facing engagement with the rest of society, the relationships we build,

    the technologies driving those changes now also make it possible to turn these
    more dynamic aspects of who we are into a means of proof—primarily in the realm
    of our social identity. Our circle of friends and interactions constitutes a web

    a large number of essentially trustworthy people—no one among them is on the no-fly

    encryption, which allows computers to figure out some useful information by running
    computation on a combined pool of data without knowing the details of its components.
    One simplified example of how to understand the concept involves a group of employees
    who don’t want to divulge their individual salaries. How can they find out the
    total salary pool and average pay per employee of the group? Well, the first person
    comes up with a random number, adds their salary to that number, then secretly
    shares the sum of the two to the next person, who adds their salary to that amount
    and secretly shares the new sum to the next person, and so on. At the end of the
    sequence, the total amount is communicated to the person who started the process,
    who then deducts the secret starting number to figure out the total salary and
    average per person—conducting a rudimentary, human computation. These fundamental
    mathematical constructs are now baked into far more complex cryptographic software
    programs that allow computer scientists to do all sorts of amazing things with
    information that needs to be kept secret. And because computers reduce all data—whether

    of his UWA degree that was itself cryptographically signed by the university and
    which he stores off-chain. These actions, together, create an immutable, verifiable
    log of the claim Michael is making to this particular attribute, his status as
    a graduate of an Aussie university. The point is that, with its capacity to build
    a time-stamped sequence of events, these blockchain transactions can affirm that
    the sequence of access rights to the data have been properly controlled by the
    rightful authority, the user.

    various doubters of blockchain tech’s capacity to fix the identity problem. Identity
    is fraught with privacy risks and, as with the problem we addressed in the previous
    chapter with regards to certifying a person’s property title, proof of identity
    hinges on the attestation of some outsider, which brings us back to the old trusted
    third-party problem. In many cases, we’re still going to need the validation of
    a bank (to show we have a fraud-free bank account), for example, or a university
    (to show we have a degree), or a Webmail provider (to show we have a legitimate
    e-mail address and are not a bot).

    ID” crowd. They include influential digital ID advocates like Steve Wilson, a
    strong advocate for shifting from the outdated model of static personal identity
    to that of cryptographically proven attributes. “The public [permissionless] blockchains
    deliberately and proudly shirk third parties, but in most cases, your identity
    is nothing without a third party who vouches for you in some way,” Wilson told
    TechCrunch. “Blockchain is great for some things, but it’s not magic, and it just
    wasn’t designed for the IDM [identity management] problem space.”

    If we want a blockchain model to prove that we are worthy to do or buy something,
    it would be more informative to confirm all the rich digital information we passively
    accumulate through our online lives than to rely on the third-party certifications
    of our life events—birth, degree, first job, etc. If we deploy appropriate encryption
    methods to hide sensitive data, our rich digital footprints can, for example,
    reveal a profile of the social network we keep, showing whether we hang out with
    high-school dropouts or people with graduate degrees. It can also glean useful
    information from our payment history, our sleep patterns, our travel, and, of
    course, our online surfing. If social media companies and others that gather such
    data can agree to open standards on metadata, a new identity culture could be
    formed that would be much more informative than anything produced by, say, credit
    score keepers such as Equifax. This is precisely what a new breed of algorithmic
    credit-scoring companies and other such big data–driven startups are doing. Putting
    all of that into a blockchain-proven system could be a powerful way to get people
    to trust each other and expand their social and economic exchanges.

    standard. Do I have better or worse credit if I view a lot of Republican political

    lies in trying to solve identity in the first place, which he says is in breach
    of what Bitcoin’s open, permissionless architecture represents. Blockchain developers
    building these identity/reputation tools are promoting a “relic of traditional
    financial systems,” he argues. Outdated financial institutions such as banks need
    reputation to function as “a proxy to identifying the default risk associated
    with a specific identity” because they’re unable to safely manage that risk, he
    says. What we should be doing, instead of acting as judge and executioner and
    making assumptions “that past behavior will give me some insight into future behavior,”
    Antonopoulos argues, is building systems that better manage default risk within
    lenders’ portfolios. Bitcoin, he sustains, has the tools to do so. There’s a lot
    of power in this technology to protect against risk: smart contracts, multi-signature
    controls that ensure that neither of two parties can run off with the funds without
    the other also signing a transaction, automated escrow arrangements, and, more
    broadly, the superior transparency and granularity of information on the public
    ledger. In other words, investors already have the tools to protect against the
    risk of loss; who cares about the identity, past behavior, and reputation of the
    people we are transacting with?'

    practical? Our entire economic system is built on something we might call the
    identity-financial complex, a model that’s deeply ingrained in the trust architecture
    with which society gets stuff done. Identifying people—whether it’s through the
    outdated analog tools of government documents, the dynamic gathering and personal
    management of our digital footprints, or simply asking someone their name—will
    continue to be a requirement to enter into exchanges with people and institutions.

    so that they aren’t worried about losing this critical passcode for both spending
    money and sharing their identifying attributes. If you forget your password at
    work, you can ask the system administrator to create you a new one, but there’s
    no one managing the Bitcoin blockchain who can do the same. What often seems like
    the obvious solution—biometrics—has its own serious issues. Even beyond the privacy
    issues we cited with India’s Aadhaar program, the problem is that biometrics,
    if stolen, cannot be reset. (You can’t just think up a new fingerprint or retina.)

    a fingerprint from a wineglass and then crack into an Apple iPhone’s Touch ID

    action is to take place, no one person can do it unilaterally; it needs the combination
    of a certain number of keyholders. The system can include one or more offline,

    to a world in which people, not the centralized institutions with which they engage,
    define who they are and what they want to share about themselves to the world.
    But it’s hard to see how we get there without a blockchain that protects all parties
    from manipulation of the data. If all we have is a cryptographically signed certificate
    from some institution, we may have a reliably certified document, but we’re also
    vulnerable to that institution’s unilateral power to revoke its signature. This
    is effectively what President Trump has done in reversing some of the orders of
    his predecessors—in revoking the rights of transgender soldiers, for example.
    The same risks always apply with digitally signed rights when they don’t reside
    in an immutable record.

    environment, it can’t be revoked, not without both parties agreeing to the reversal

    the folks at Learning Machine are developing a product to prove people’s educational
    bona fides on Blockcerts, an MIT Media Lab–initiated open-source code for notarizing
    university transcripts that hashes those documents to the bitcoin blockchain.
    Note the deliberate choice of the most secure, permissionless blockchain, Bitcoin’s.
    A permissioned blockchain would fall short of the ideal because there, too, the
    central authority controlling the network could always override the private keys
    of the individual and could revoke their educational certificates. A permissionless
    blockchain is the only way to give real control/ownership of the document to the
    graduate, so that he/she can disclose this particularly important attribute at
    will to anyone who demands it. As Learning Machine CEO Chris Jagers says, “self-sovereignty
