- en: The blockchain is a decentralized data processing where it is used to store
    all the data in a secured manner. In recent technology, the blockchain is evolved
    from 2012 where it has been carried out for transactions where it is mainly on
    cryptocurrency and bitcoin. The blockchain is having many applications where the
    data can be stored securely even in education, healthcare, industries, and many
    more applications which are related to blockchain. It is mainly concentrated on
    business processing where the transactions have been done using the smart contract.
    The blocks are being created to store the data, and, in each block, the data has
    been transferred using the hash values when there is a change in a single block
    and when the forthcoming blocks will get changed and the hash value for each block
    gets changed (Roman-Belmonte et al., [2018](#CR9)). Here in this article, the
    data on personal health data is used to be transferred from one system to the
    other systems so I have high security on data transmission. The blockchain has
    been included, and then intelligence system  has been generated for transferring
    the data which helps in making decision support mechanism to improve the efficiency
    of data transmission. The various encryption mechanisms have been followed to
    transfer the data between the two-pair systems to avoid your centralized data
    management where any error occurs in the server that the data cannot be retrieved.
    The data consistency  is high in blockchain technology because whenever the data
    has been needed, the availability of the data has been comparatively high in blockchain
    techniques. It is one of the important properties of a blockchain where it has
    been characterized as the energy efficiency in storing your data. The survey is
    specially made on the healthcare systems because the patient data has not been
    disclosed to any of the third party so the blockchain helps in securing the data
    at a high rate. Even though the blockchain works on the public key, the authentication
    of accessing a decentralized system is much easier, but the security gets increased
    in some sort of encryption mechanism. There are some important components in blockchain;
    the first and foremost one is a smart contract, and the next one is going to be
    on the data ledger. In many organizations they use blockchain for transactions
    where fraud can be detected easily and fault tolerance is high in the blockchain
    which is one of the main characteristics of defining a blockchain mechanism (Abu-Elezz
    et al., [2020](#CR6)). In this research article, the focus is mainly on health
    data where it provides high security. The intelligent algorithm has been described
    to identify the patient records and give the decision on diagnosing the patient’s
    disease. An improvised solution is being generated for transferring the data from
    one system to the other system where the data is being hashed.

    faced in the industry where all the transactions are made ten blocks so that there
    will be no fraud detection inside the block where we use your techniques to transfer
    the information as a public key (Zhang et al., [2018](#CR5)). Nowadays the organization
    started to move to the blockchains where the blocks are being created for transferring
    the information through the networks. Still, several characteristics that have
    been defined in the blockchain are the lack of scalability, the lack of interoperability,
    and the lack of blockchain-talented transactions. The adoptions have also been
    defined as the main challenge in techniques used in blocks. Here the understanding

    VerifiableIn this research article, the author mainly focused on the person sharing
    data  in the third-party devices or applications (Wang et al., [2019](#CR3)).
    The personal records have been maintained as a separate one which has not been
    started to any of the users in the clouds. So to identify this particular drawback,
    the author had discussed more on the encryption process and also the key limits
    of sharing a data with the users. Here the author has described mainly on the
    integrity of the data and also how the data is being stored in the decentralized
    service by using blockchain technology. In this, it has been mainly focused on
    data transfer where the data should not be transferred to any of the third party
    like cloud. The important data may be uses for value purpose and for research
    purpose. In this search strategy searchable schematic encryption, attribute-based
    encryption blockchain technology and other security scheme where discussed. The
    data structure of the blockchain technology has been described with different
    algorithms like key generation process. The first process in the algorithm is
    used to encrypt the given data, and the second process will be based on generating
    a public key. To get access to that particular data stored, the storing configuration
    has been defined as the third process. Finally, the data has been shown in the
    block using a hash table where hash values have been generated by the user. The
    token generation algorithm has been defined for reteriving data form owner of
    the block. if it is accessed by any of the unauthorized person they should get
    access permission for accessing the data from the original file system. Personal
    healthcare data increases the ability to have direct contact in their records.
    Implementation of the smart contract is being done using the data integrity contracts
    where it has been verified using some of the tokenization methods by having the
    different functions described on the patient data. The cost of the smart contract
    has been developed using a tool where it remixes both your encrypted value and
    also the hash value which has been generated using operations like storing, indexing  ,
    delete indexing, and searching. The security analysis has been made on the records
    by different aspects like analyzing the tamper proof for privacy protection and
    key management gaining access to control searching and verify ability. It has
    been done using the data which is being stored in a private server. This discussion
    is mainly on solving the problems that has been described in the existing personal

    (Liu et al., [2019](#CR15)) where the application has been produced by the health
    industry  where it has been specifically defined by the cost of the product and
    also defines about the management of the entire industry. The blockchain technology
    has been defined as the important application in the industry where it meets the
    major challenges in the organization regarding the transactions between each of
    the organizations. They discussed more on healthcare ecosystem where the stakeholders
    and the interactions are being made between all the members in the industry. The
    providers will include all the community challenges faced by the organization,
    and all the data has been stored in this ecosystem as a ledger. The vendor will
    provide all the related information inside the ecosystem, and the quality of data
    has been transmitted as a plan. Therefore, patients are mainly defined with three
    categories: the first one is risk level, the second one is demographics, and the
    third one will be the geography. In the industry the traditional representation
    of the patient centric is been defined using the provided players with the parametric
    research organizations and finally defined on social media, health applications.
    The discussion is mainly on fragmented data, data security, patient’s data accessing,
    and data inconsistency. Here the blockchain technology and its application have
    been discussed how the industry  perspective has been met with expanding the needs
    of the delivered products and also the financial models. The smart contract is
    being mainly focused on the application where the ledger is being used to store
    the information and product has been redefined whenever there are any changes.
    A smart contract is being created as a subsequent feature for the business rules,
    and it’s associated with the patient records where the smart contract has been
    considered to create as a document for the ledger or to store the information.
    One of the main types where the quality of data is being collected and the data
    which is being collected will be defined for transferring the data in the blocks.
    An application has been discussed in this article where it is mainly on the case
    management. There are three different phases used to transfer the data and store
    the data. The first phase is a patient identification with similar conditions  .
    The second phase is to store all the data into the ledger which collects all the
    records and whenever there is a change. The status can be changed in the ledger.
    The third phase is on other patient’s data which is to be tracked, and it is to
    be collected into an open ledger from different platforms (Fig. [11.5](#Fig5)).![../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig5_HTML.png)'

- en: The main process in the blockchain is to transact the information from one peer
    system to another peer system to achieve this process. The block has been represented
    using the transaction key where it includes information from a different transaction
    where a public key is generated. This public key is shared only to the authorized
    process. To encrypt a single data, many encryption algorithms is being followed.
    These algorithms are already discussed in the survey of our article. Here the
    scalability  is the main challenge where blocks cannot enlarge in any of the block
    generated. The main disadvantage is the blockchain technology where blocks are
    immutable. An important process has been discussed in this workspace where the
    patient data is being incorporated using the sensor. Each data gets changed from
    time to time. The monitoring system  can be converted into blocks where existing
    blocks added to the transaction blocks and the hash values are being generated
    to get secured information for individual patient data (Ichikawa et al., [2017](#CR7)).
    This data is being shared to the experts who are going to check the history of
    patient data, and they diagnose about the health condition for that particular
    patient. Each data in the block has been connected, and each transaction of the
    changes has been made in the ledger. Whenever a new data arises, the blocks already
    having the information will be added to a ledger, and it collects the overall
    information and stores in the smart contract. After the data has been collected
    in the ledger, it will be transmitted to the application development system where
    the monitoring has been notified using mobile devices (Figs. [11.6](#Fig6) and
    [11.7](#Fig7)).![../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig6_HTML.png)

    consult many experts in the field to make the decision. So to maintain the body
    condition in a stable state, the study helps in making better performance in identifying
    the problem, and suggested solution in an automated way deals with the betterment
    of clinical decision-making system. Here this study deals with the same process
