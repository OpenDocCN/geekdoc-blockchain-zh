- en: The blockchain is a decentralized data processing where it is used to store
    all the data in a secured manner. In recent technology, the blockchain is evolved
    from 2012 where it has been carried out for transactions where it is mainly on
    cryptocurrency and bitcoin. The blockchain is having many applications where the
    data can be stored securely even in education, healthcare, industries, and many
    more applications which are related to blockchain. It is mainly concentrated on
    business processing where the transactions have been done using the smart contract.
    The blocks are being created to store the data, and, in each block, the data has
    been transferred using the hash values when there is a change in a single block
    and when the forthcoming blocks will get changed and the hash value for each block
    gets changed (Roman-Belmonte et al., [2018](#CR9)). Here in this article, the
    data on personal health data is used to be transferred from one system to the
    other systems so I have high security on data transmission. The blockchain has
    been included, and then intelligence system  has been generated for transferring
    the data which helps in making decision support mechanism to improve the efficiency
    of data transmission. The various encryption mechanisms have been followed to
    transfer the data between the two-pair systems to avoid your centralized data
    management where any error occurs in the server that the data cannot be retrieved.
    The data consistency  is high in blockchain technology because whenever the data
    has been needed, the availability of the data has been comparatively high in blockchain
    techniques. It is one of the important properties of a blockchain where it has
    been characterized as the energy efficiency in storing your data. The survey is
    specially made on the healthcare systems because the patient data has not been
    disclosed to any of the third party so the blockchain helps in securing the data
    at a high rate. Even though the blockchain works on the public key, the authentication
    of accessing a decentralized system is much easier, but the security gets increased
    in some sort of encryption mechanism. There are some important components in blockchain;
    the first and foremost one is a smart contract, and the next one is going to be
    on the data ledger. In many organizations they use blockchain for transactions
    where fraud can be detected easily and fault tolerance is high in the blockchain
    which is one of the main characteristics of defining a blockchain mechanism (Abu-Elezz
    et al., [2020](#CR6)). In this research article, the focus is mainly on health
    data where it provides high security. The intelligent algorithm has been described
    to identify the patient records and give the decision on diagnosing the patient’s
    disease. An improvised solution is being generated for transferring the data from
    one system to the other system where the data is being hashed.

    the new technology and understanding the concept behind the blockchain process
    and the use of block chain in the industry perspective or other applications and
    the cost efficiency of data processing. There are some challenges that are being
    obtained in the blockchain. Security and privacy are the major important effectiveness
    in the blockchain. The lack of awareness among this technology is the main challenge
    faced in the industry where all the transactions are made ten blocks so that there
    will be no fraud detection inside the block where we use your techniques to transfer
    the information as a public key (Zhang et al., [2018](#CR5)). Nowadays the organization
    started to move to the blockchains where the blocks are being created for transferring
    the information through the networks. Still, several characteristics that have
    been defined in the blockchain are the lack of scalability, the lack of interoperability,
    and the lack of blockchain-talented transactions. The adoptions have also been
    defined as the main challenge in techniques used in blocks. Here the understanding
    of blockchain has been met as a big challenge where it has been defined as the
    distributed ledger so the process inside the block for the user understanding
    is really difficult.

    through Cover-Kmeans with OntoVsm for information retrieval. The blockchain has
    been defined as a private ledger where the data transmission has been visible
    by all the blocks so the privacy platform has not been defined in this particular
    blockchain. Still it is a problem for the person who has been defined in the organization
    for tracking the information in each block, where the transactions inside the
    blocks are not private so some knowledge in transferring the data among each block
    has to be defined by the industry perspective. One of the main challenges of the
    block is the lack of scalability. There is a scalable technique which is being
    put a strange in the public blockchain so the ledger transactions inside the blocks
    have been defined as the material blocks with the lack of scalability (Figs. [11.1](#Fig1)

    In this paper, it is mainly based on the access control mechanism to the healthcare
    records, and also it is being coordinated with the health information technology
    that is called as ONC. It was mainly on the fundamentals of blockchain technologies,
    distributed networks, and their shared ledgers. The data has been transferred

    defined by the blockchain and how it helps in fulfilling the gap of research and
    also the semantic analysis  (Alla et al., [2018](#CR2)). This chapter deals with
    blockchain technologies which will describe more about the research-oriented metrics.
    The mechanism is involved in fulfilling the challenges of the block modifed and
    it is mainly concentrated on healthcare and now particular research article describes
    with new domain which is been combined Internet of things (IoT). Here the author
    examines the working of the bitcoin in both peer-to-peer and also a single point
    of failure systems. The detailed structure about how the bitcoin works, how the
    blockchain is designed, and how the connectivity between each block has been explained
    using a sample blockchain structure. The applications of the blockchain are related
    to research topics like healthcare. A systematic study is being made by analyzing
    and identifying the advantage or disadvantage and the challenges faced by developing
    blockchain techniques. It is mainly focused on the security issues on data transfer
    in real-time application like healthcare systems, where it defines how the data
    has been transferred in a secured way and how the gap has been filled in the research
    strategy which has been described clearly by maintaining the result of a block
    obtained. Here the data is being handled by the patient to transfer its own data
    to the data center where he has been an authorized person to give the access to
    the data center, and then the amount of data transferred between each of the peer
    systems can also be controlled by the patient or user who has been defining the
    entire process of the system. It has been defined as a main challenging face of
    your blockchain  in a user perspective. In this chapter, a survey is made on the
    papers published on the domain blockchain, and its methods were discussed with

    VerifiableIn this research article, the author mainly focused on the person sharing
    data  in the third-party devices or applications (Wang et al., [2019](#CR3)).
    The personal records have been maintained as a separate one which has not been
    started to any of the users in the clouds. So to identify this particular drawback,
    the author had discussed more on the encryption process and also the key limits
    of sharing a data with the users. Here the author has described mainly on the
    integrity of the data and also how the data is being stored in the decentralized
    service by using blockchain technology. In this, it has been mainly focused on
    data transfer where the data should not be transferred to any of the third party
    like cloud. The important data may be uses for value purpose and for research
    purpose. In this search strategy searchable schematic encryption, attribute-based
    encryption blockchain technology and other security scheme where discussed. The
    data structure of the blockchain technology has been described with different
    algorithms like key generation process. The first process in the algorithm is
    used to encrypt the given data, and the second process will be based on generating
    a public key. To get access to that particular data stored, the storing configuration
    has been defined as the third process. Finally, the data has been shown in the
    block using a hash table where hash values have been generated by the user. The
    token generation algorithm has been defined for reteriving data form owner of
    the block. if it is accessed by any of the unauthorized person they should get
    access permission for accessing the data from the original file system. Personal
    healthcare data increases the ability to have direct contact in their records.
    Implementation of the smart contract is being done using the data integrity contracts
    where it has been verified using some of the tokenization methods by having the
    different functions described on the patient data. The cost of the smart contract
    has been developed using a tool where it remixes both your encrypted value and
    also the hash value which has been generated using operations like storing, indexing  ,
    delete indexing, and searching. The security analysis has been made on the records
    by different aspects like analyzing the tamper proof for privacy protection and
    key management gaining access to control searching and verify ability. It has
    been done using the data which is being stored in a private server. This discussion
    is mainly on solving the problems that has been described in the existing personal
    records which are being stored in the third party to avoid such processing. A
    newly proposed method of storing the data in the block is implemented (Fig. [11.4](#Fig4)).![../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig4_HTML.png)

    industry  where it has been specifically defined by the cost of the product and
    also defines about the management of the entire industry. The blockchain technology
    has been defined as the important application in the industry where it meets the
    major challenges in the organization regarding the transactions between each of
    the organizations. They discussed more on healthcare ecosystem where the stakeholders
    and the interactions are being made between all the members in the industry. The
    providers will include all the community challenges faced by the organization,
    and all the data has been stored in this ecosystem as a ledger. The vendor will
    provide all the related information inside the ecosystem, and the quality of data
    has been transmitted as a plan. Therefore, patients are mainly defined with three
    categories: the first one is risk level, the second one is demographics, and the
    third one will be the geography. In the industry the traditional representation
    of the patient centric is been defined using the provided players with the parametric
    research organizations and finally defined on social media, health applications.
    The discussion is mainly on fragmented data, data security, patient’s data accessing,
    and data inconsistency. Here the blockchain technology and its application have
    been discussed how the industry  perspective has been met with expanding the needs
    of the delivered products and also the financial models. The smart contract is
    being mainly focused on the application where the ledger is being used to store
    the information and product has been redefined whenever there are any changes.
    A smart contract is being created as a subsequent feature for the business rules,
    and it’s associated with the patient records where the smart contract has been
    considered to create as a document for the ledger or to store the information.
    One of the main types where the quality of data is being collected and the data
    which is being collected will be defined for transferring the data in the blocks.
    An application has been discussed in this article where it is mainly on the case
    management. There are three different phases used to transfer the data and store
    the data. The first phase is a patient identification with similar conditions  .
    The second phase is to store all the data into the ledger which collects all the
    records and whenever there is a change. The status can be changed in the ledger.
    The third phase is on other patient’s data which is to be tracked, and it is to
    be collected into an open ledger from different platforms (Fig. [11.5](#Fig5)).![../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig5_HTML.png)'

    has a copy of the block inside the network to prevent data loss. Data immutability  has
    also been carried out where the modification and deletion cannot be done after
    the data has been stored. Cost efficiency is being maintained by choosing the
    domain as a blockchain because the decentralized system has been maintained between
    the layers of blocks like a public or private block which has been explored in
    the transactions. The example is taken as insurance field where the patient who
    has been admitted in the hospital will transact fair amount through the insurance
    agencies that have been taken as an example, and there is an application related
    to a blockchain like IoT, education, finance, government, and IPR extra. While

- en: The main process in the blockchain is to transact the information from one peer
    system to another peer system to achieve this process. The block has been represented
    using the transaction key where it includes information from a different transaction
    where a public key is generated. This public key is shared only to the authorized
    process. To encrypt a single data, many encryption algorithms is being followed.
    These algorithms are already discussed in the survey of our article. Here the
    scalability  is the main challenge where blocks cannot enlarge in any of the block
    generated. The main disadvantage is the blockchain technology where blocks are
    immutable. An important process has been discussed in this workspace where the
    patient data is being incorporated using the sensor. Each data gets changed from
    time to time. The monitoring system  can be converted into blocks where existing
    blocks added to the transaction blocks and the hash values are being generated
    to get secured information for individual patient data (Ichikawa et al., [2017](#CR7)).
    This data is being shared to the experts who are going to check the history of
    patient data, and they diagnose about the health condition for that particular
    patient. Each data in the block has been connected, and each transaction of the
    changes has been made in the ledger. Whenever a new data arises, the blocks already
    having the information will be added to a ledger, and it collects the overall
    information and stores in the smart contract. After the data has been collected
    in the ledger, it will be transmitted to the application development system where
    the monitoring has been notified using mobile devices (Figs. [11.6](#Fig6) and
    [11.7](#Fig7)).![../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_11_Chapter/504166_1_En_11_Fig6_HTML.png)

- en: A deep insight is made on a medical data set which helps in identifying an effective
    result on decision-making system  , though there are several ways in finding the
    patient’s condition and a result of medical diagnosis. The normal process of identifying
    diseases in a single patient is a big task for a clinical system. To minimize
    all the process flow, every process should be done automated. In this method,
    a perfect match is found to implement the clinical process as a single automated
    system to reduce the human effort and error rate. After the system diagnosis process
    gets over, the doctors and experts in the field want to decide on the solution
    for the physical problem that arises in human body parts. For a small problem
    like muscle twist, there is a long process to be carried on to remove the pain
    from the body in which it activates some movement that can’t be possible to do
    by the patient. Similarly, if it is a major operation, then the patient should
    consult many experts in the field to make the decision. So to maintain the body
    condition in a stable state, the study helps in making better performance in identifying
    the problem, and suggested solution in an automated way deals with the betterment
    of clinical decision-making system. Here this study deals with the same process
    flow but with automated system flow with effective solution rate. The process
    deals with a knowledge base where the decisions are made through an expert system
    and inference engine which is the brain of an expert system with which a solution-based
    clinical process is carried out. The new mechanism deals with all the drawbacks
    of the entire traditional system which helps in maintaining the entire work flow
    in a simple automated way. The better result will define a better solution in
    both decision-making and finding the clinical report for each patient. The data

    by the diseases and solution or treatment given for the patient on how much it
    affects the patient in the normal routine. If it affects in a larger part of the
    body, what method are to be followed for the betterment and what are all the possible
    ways to cure the diseases? These major changes will affect all aspect of the solution
    system which defines all the possible solution. Examine all the possible symptoms
    to diagnosis and to confirm the disease in the body of the human for the final

    to the doctors, that is a coma patient. Any emergency has been identified. This
    particular intelligence system will act as an interface between the patient and
    doctor. When the patient needs some emergencies, this particular application will
    help in giving the solution for this particular problem (Ahmad et al., [2019](#CR10)).

    time to time, and it has been stored in the block. Each time the doctor cannot
    visit and check for history of patient record, so it is updated in the blocks
    using intelligence system. The data has been taken and stored inside the ledger
    where the smart contract  has been generated for doing the process with the intelligence
    system and also the interface to the doctor. Each valuable input has been transferred
    in the block using the transaction blocks when the data has been sold in the ledger
    each time the notification is being sent through the devices. The coma patient’s
    information has been gathered from time to time using the intelligent system where
    the coma patient interaction is between the system and also the doctor’s query.
    An alert message has been sent to all the experts for any emergency.

    transactions. The hash values have been generated when there is a transaction
    from one block to the other blocks. Encryption algorithm  has also been described
    for each individual phase for transaction. Though blockchain is immutable, data
    will not be any change in the blocks so the update can be made in each block using
    the input gathered by the intelligence systems and the coding to that update,
    and hash value will be generated for the remaining blocks (Figs. [11.9](#Fig9)

- en: The smart system generated for this specific blockchain technology is enhanced
    by providing better data transmission protection from one system to another system.
    This proposed method enhances data transmission efficiency and also provides a
    better result in the use of the blockchain to diagnose the healthcare outcome,
    while blockchain methods of transmission give you quality, a greater development
    in all respects, in data transmission, and even in effectively managing the data
    using the Ethereum platform. Cost effectiveness is reduced, and the protection
    of data transmission in each block is enhanced. In the future, the data will be
    strengthened by the doctor’s expert comment, and all aspects will be improved
    by storing and retrieving information through the smart contract.
