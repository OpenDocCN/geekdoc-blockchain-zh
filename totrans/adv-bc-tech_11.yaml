    a particular system function (e.g., movement/guidance of a drone or manned aircraft).
    If the function creates a hazard, this can cause a mishap that has a consequence
    of a catastrophic and critical event, resulting in death or resources destroyed.
    There is no redo, reboot, or retraining of an AI function that fails in this scenario.
    Software safety engineering and test and evaluation efforts to ensure fidelity
    include data-related elements such as process flow, code level, and data structure
    analysis. Cybersecurity plays a role in ensuring cyberattacks do not compromise
    the integrity of the data elements such as AI training sets.

    supporting critical systems such as electrical grids or defense systems are targets
    for increasingly sophisticated adversarial machine learning attacks, which attempt
    to fool models through malicious input into the system such as AI poisoning and
    other attacks. Athalye et al. [[5](#CR5)] showed that it is even possible to fool
    an AI into having it identify a turtle wrongly as a rifle and such attacks are
    likely to become more sophisticated. BC could be used as a countermeasure to prevent
    such poisoning as well as safeguard system integrity. BC, specifically Hyperledger
    Fabric (HLF), is a tamper-resistant decentralized trusted ledger that provides
    proof of transaction where trust is implemented through distributed consensus
    to ensure that only authorized people can modify the code base, AI algorithm,
    or training set and that the modification is traceable and transparent. Distributed
    ledgers provide system safety through BC provenance and policy enforcement through
    a feature called smart contracts, which imbed logical code. Data in support of
    AI and software development can also suffer not only from deliberate sabotage
    or ruse but also from human error.

    and sensors down to the edge for training sets supporting AI development. Getting
    the right and accurate data can be a complex process, and error or intentional
    manipulation is always a concern. The number of sensors and IoT devices, such
    as smart thermometers/oximeters to track COVID-19, has caused an explosion of
    data generation but not an increase in safeguards to ensure system safety if these
    edge devices are used to control machines or make life-critical decisions.

    a single point of failure, a new target for a cyberattack, and cause a bottleneck
    and high latency [[6](#CR6)]. Typically, an ML project may require diverse data
    sources and modalities. One example may be drones flying over an urban area, which
    requires its ML training set data on the region, including crime rate, weather,
    and road conditions/constraints. For just this simple example, data needed may
    include war-gaming, tabletop exercises, lessons learned, product performance specifications,
    contractor specifications, test evaluation results, a diverse set of sensors,
    IoT devices, and so on. Once an AI is trained, BC can be used to ensure the integrity
    of the data during operations. BC can be used to find the right data, what is
    in it, who owns it, and how to get it with quick authorization. Data scientists
    have long recognized that just getting the right data and permission to use it
    can be an arduous and long process.

    There must be confidence in the data and training sets and the algorithms, and
    there must be confidence that they are tamper proof and free from anomalies, intentional
    or by accident. Acquisition communities cannot identify and certify operational

    three general use cases for naval logistics, including financial and inventory
    transaction audit trails, serial number tracking, and maintenance log integrity.
    We believe the BC network derived from these three use cases could be adapted
    for system safety and cybersecurity purposes since all our previous demonstrations
    dealt with the integrity of the data supporting work processes and events. BC
    tracks food/part items as assets recorded on ledgers, and training data are assets
    and are also created with similar work processes and events. With HLF, you can
    control who, what, and when and identify those who have access to the logistics
    data representing assets as well through an immutable ledger containing logistics
    data that cannot be tampered with. These HLF attributes are similar to what is
    needed to curate data assets. HLF is as transparent as needed but can hide data
    from those without a need to know.

    similar to previous BC research on naval supply chains to improve transparency
    and the safety of the related supply chain data and transactions, but there is
    a higher level of risk since they are often at Level 1 or Level 2 autonomous systems.
    In a sense, training sets and analytical data are like the tracking of parts and
    food since they point to resources represented by the information that needs to
    be protected and distributed in a friction-free manner. Control of these sources
    during the integration process to create training data and general analysis is
    vital to ensure the training sets and AI algorithms are transparent to those who
    need them and are controlled and their validity supported by an audit trail that
    BC provides. Training set alterations could go unnoticed within the AI function
    build process but revealed during operation in hazards affecting unwanted human
    death or resource destruction. Our previous research demonstrated how BC can provide
    a needed data management technology through a tamper-resistant decentralized trusted
    ledger that provides proof of transaction where trust is implemented through distributed
    consensus.

    no “proof of work” protocol, which is a wasteful use of computer resources. HLF
    uses channels to control who can see what data and through consensus; a large
    organization can control what is allowed to be put on the BC ledger. Such technologies
    can not only be used in naval supply and logistics to streamline and improve effectiveness
    in terms of how workflow can be improved to provide more rapid and secure distribution
    of material and two-way financial transactions but can also be used on data transactions
    such as datasets requested by data scientists. Data scientists have long recognized
    that obtaining “clean data” and the permission to use it has been hampered by
    administrative friction, which can be caused by data owner’s requirements, trust
    issues from generated data source transactions, and other administrative processes.

    distributed ledger that works on the consensus model that is an integral component
    of the “trust system” in the BC. Essentially, the fabric environment provides
    the “common logging” and service management components on the platform, and the
    containerized infrastructure allows developers to build a BC network where data
    is recorded on distributed ledgers where the data written can be trusted and transactions
    are immutable and tamper proof. Smart contracts can embed legal knowledge, laws,
    and regulations and enforce data policy. BC/HLF can also provide “provenance”
    of an item, such as food or a part, and trace back to the source of that part
    or food item in case of contamination or counterfeit/defective parts as well as
    other times such as blocks of data in support of AI.

    if modified, as both sets of use cases track assets—one tracks food items and
    the other tracks datasets as assets. The key for repurposing a supply chain for
    use in software safety support is through the addition of off-chain application
    programming interface (API), such as representational state transfer (REST, or
    many others), which provides an interface between the BC and the outside world
    and to what is called “the last mile,” which in most of our use cases is a Web

    chain, which would be similar to a data supply chain used for data system safety.

    check for illogical data entries, but it isn’t always being done, and typically
    several databases and sources may be involved in a maintenance information system
    to make such error checking costly or not practical. While some minor errors may
    be acceptable in transactional databases, these errors could have an impact on

    and the building of AI models*.* Figure [2](#Fig2) shows application A2, which
    could be a customer/client such as a data scientist that is interested in datasets
    or training sets for an AI project. This customer per the diagram (set up by CC)
    has access to Channels 1 and 2, which means he can view Ledgers 1 through 3, which
    would be information about various datasets that can be accessed. In one scenario,
    the person using A2, the Web application, for example, could search for a specific
    dataset or topic and then request that dataset through the application, which
    would check the smart contract—let’s say for L2—to see if the system allows read
    access to the repository.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Existing off-chain software would complete the task and send an anchor or link
    (URL) to retrieve that dataset. The customer could later check back and see if
    the data have changed/been tampered with or if the data were given to another
    user. Also, the client would be provided the provenance and metadata and even
    points of contact, including subject matter experts and the owner of the data.
    The client can check to see if the dataset has changed and who changed it, since
    any changes to the repository would be recorded in the appropriate ledger as to
    who, when, and what. Smart contracts could also provide some prefiltering through
    smart contracts to reduce unintentional errors. In the past, this has been done
    pre-analysis, but by using smart contracts, this would only need to be done once
    and not by each researcher or customer. This AI system safety idea is similar
    to the IBM concept [[13](#CR13)], where the authors sought a trusted AI environment
    through provenance with a BC library exposed by REST or Python APIs that provided
    support for “immutable recording of the AI process, querying for traceability
    and audit, fair value attribution, etc.” We take it a further step to suggest
    that BC can be part of a smart repository solution that allows clients to search
    and find trusted datasets and safeguard them. A variation of this use case is
    a federated learning (FL) scenario that uses a collaborative ML technique whereby
    the devices collectively train and update a shared ML model while preserving their
    datasets. Even in a trusted military network using a private BC, some devices
    on the edge may prove untrustworthy, and ur Rehman et al. [[14](#CR14)] propose
    a reputation-aware FL that enables trust through BC consensus and trust algorithms
    through BC smart contracts.

    solutions that can adapt to changing events and environments. An engineered solution
    must address highly complex problems through adaptive architectures and the embedding
    of constituent systems with the intelligence to learn, self-organize, collaborate,
    and evolve to achieve desired adaptable emergent behavior. Advances in information
    and computational technologies and the emergence of IoT devices that perceive
    their internal and external environments to enable the potential development of
    complex, adaptive, and intelligent capabilities needed to engineer a complex adaptive
    system of system solutions. Blockchain learning coupled with a federated learning
    approach could be key enablers for engineered solutions that address highly complex
    problems through self-organization and desired emergent behavior. A blockchain
    approach can ensure trust among IoT devices (intelligent constituent systems)
    exchanging information and collaborating in a Federated Learning architecture.
    Johnson [[15](#CR15)] notes that system information assurance is critical in an
    adaptive complex system as communication issues could take the form of a cyberattack,
    injecting unauthenticated and/or false data into the system or causing denials
    of service. Blockchain could monitor IoT devices and prefilter out any unreliable
    data sources or unauthenticated IoT devices to ensure trusted collaborations using
    trust algorithms embedded in blockchain smart contracts.

    is. Based on governance, the BC and smart contract will decide if that data scientist
    has the authority to retrieve the data. If so, the client will be sent a link
    to access the repository or even an IoT device or a BC repository with frequently
    used datasets, through x.509 certificates, which will have the identity verified
    by the BC, as well as the sending to the client hash value making sure the dataset
    hasn’t been tampered with. The smart contract may do some initial cleaning up

    access and identity management for the Navy supply and logistics systems in a
    cost-effective manner to reduce administrative friction and how BC could improve
    Navy logistics to the last tactical mile. In our scenario, the first destination
    transportation (FDT) refers to the movement and cost of moving shipments from
    free on board (FOB) points of origin to the location at which the shipment is
    first received for use or storage. As naval regulations apply, the first checkpoint
    of where a shipment is received, whether within the United States (CONUS) or outside
    (OCONUS), begins with a supplier outside of the DoD supply system or industrial
    activity that creates the shipment. The labor and transportation charges, including
    freight drayage, cartage, port handling, and other in-transit costs, are processed
    at the FDT. Freight cartage refers to any inland transit of cargo between locations,
    which serves as the “checkpoints” in the BC network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a location is assigned responsibility for “cartage of consignments” to
    land-based activities, ships, or other transport units, the charges of transportation
    are given to the location of assigned responsibility, which acts as a peer node
    checkpoint in the network. At this point, the initial entry in the ledger may
    be created and committed by the peer node belonging to the FDT and the orderers.
    It is important to note that FDT does not only include shipments of equipment
    but also the initial transportation of Navy-owned materials that are provided
    to a contractor for research. This indicates that the charges of a shipment from
    a contractor’s facility to its final destination point are paid by the government.
    However, to maintain the legitimacy of a decentralized ledger in this research
    study, the network for which the ledger is maintained consists of only contractors,
    supply facilities, and final base destinations. Essentially, tracking responsibility
    is passed down from supplier to checkpoint. The checkpoint managers responsible
    for the charges in a shipment delivery may create and commit the transaction over
    the BC network, and the next checkpoint manager may agree or disagree about the
    condition and extraneous details of the shipment that the previous manager signed.
    Currently, the Department of Navy (DON) uses service-wide transport (SWT) as a
    clearinghouse, which is a centralized operation and maintenance manager created
    to provide transportation funds for naval shipments and mail. Since naval cargo
    and the movement of mail to bases are not responsibilities of a destination location,
    the SWT was created to pay for the movement of material, such as aircraft engines,
    mission module packages, catapult and arresting gear, propellers, shafts, civil
    engineering support equipment, safety equipment, drones, overseas mail, and Navy
    Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM) merchandise shipped from the United States to
    international locations.

- en: When a member organization needs to see a part of the ledger, then channels
    have to be created. Membership to a channel is restricted to a subgroup of the
    organizations. In using chaincode, the metrics part of the ledger is provided
    to members of the metrics channel. There exists another channel where members
    can see the raw data using queries—again dictated by the chaincode. Membership
    to the two channels is a different set of organizations. Similar development methods
    used in Use Case 1 apply to Use Case 2.

    (not all). These members will be able to access the data in CouchDB via API queries.
    Chaincode will decide which source code (stored in the CouchDB) is provided as
    a returned result of the query. The database is replicated on every node, which
    might be an advantage on the edge and an I/O to IoT devices on the edge. Specific
    use cases for this capability haven’t been developed.

- en: We demonstrated through IBM and Oracle examples that HLF could meet logistics/audit
    and security requirements through smart contracts and the inherent trust systems
    with embedded certificates. Data entry errors could be reduced through smart contracts,
    which is an inherent feature of HLF. We believe a consortium BC through HLF would
    be a way to go to be able to share information (through the ledger) with suppliers
    and other third parties but also have the capability not to share when appropriate.
    BC could add the capability for secure transactions through certificates and the
    immutability of the transactions on the BC. The additional capability of BC on
    Navy logistics and supply would be able to catch some data entry errors, to trace
    back to the source, and basically to better know the what, the who (verified),
    and the where of various transactions generated by the supply chain.

- en: We found that both IBM and Oracle BC platforms may be used to create a secure
    network of peer nodes or naval hotspots that can generate a consensus for the
    legitimacy of the shipment ledger, which can only be modified using smart contracts.
    Since a key component of both platforms is maintaining the accuracy and security
    of the ledger, all users must consistently export and import the smart contracts
    and ledgers onto their respective peer nodes every time an update is made on the
    ledger or if the transaction protocol on the smart contract is changed. A special
    concern with Navy logistics is the possibility of unreliable networks, especially
    from shore to ship. The BC protocol creates a multitude of copies of the blocks
    (the public ledger), and if connectivity is lost, the blocks will be updated once
    the network node communications are reestablished. Both IBM and Oracle BC platforms
    were accessed through the cloud, but the option is for the Navy to put either
    platform on its implementation of the cloud or on servers.

    how the whole network infrastructure was implemented, user interfaces, developer
    tools and application programming interfaces provided, and how the implementation
    would connect to the Navy’s legacy systems to reach the last mile, such as on
    the ship. These were real value-added capabilities since HLF alone cannot make
    an enterprise BC system that supports the existing logistics information system.

- en: We found a “consortium BC” with a BC consensus network to be the best fit for
    the use cases. A consortium allows both private and public users to use the BC,
    while control is maintained by the private users (the Navy) through a consensus
    network, which means by the consensus of trusted Navy entities. This is contrasted
    by PoW BC networks used in cyber currency, which are inefficient and not appropriate
    for a government entity. BC technology has the potential for revolutionizing the
    logistics process by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of logistical generated
    data as well as providing provenance of parts and food, but it is new and risky.

- en: The team also compared the IBM and Oracle BC platforms on efficiency and maintainability
    of a ledger of shipments and discovered that it was easier to use the IBM platform
    to create and export smart contracts and ledger; however, in September 2021, Oracle
    will provide similar capabilities for developing and deploying smart contracts.
    The IBM platform required users to develop their smart contract on the Visual
    Studio Code environment, export the contract as a .JSON file, log in to the online
    BC network, and import the contract and ledger as a .CSV file using a converter.

    to join ledgers more cohesively. The Oracle platform allowed users to log in to
    the Oracle cloud after they were approved by an administrator and used simple
    software like integrated development environment (IDE) and the software development
    kit. Furthermore, the Oracle Blockchain Platform employed chaincode as a smart
    contract for transactional protocols in the network. A chaincode is written in
    either Java, Node.js, or Go and packaged into a ZIP file, which can be installed
    on the network. This is similar to how smart contracts are exported as .JSON files
    and uploaded on the IBM network as .CSV files. More specifically, chaincodes outline
    the structure of the ledger, initialize it, create updates (such as reading or
    updating entries), and respond to queries.

    technology (GPT) like the Internet, so BC isn’t a solution in and of itself, but
    it acts as an enabler that provides a trusted, distributed ledger that could be
    used for smart repositories and software safety. If other technologies are better,
    then why aren’t they commonplace? BC isn’t *the* solution but, along with off-chain
    technology, may be a technology that enhances existing business processes.

    or general-purpose technology (GPT)—so in itself, it is not a solution. You must
    use a BC protocol within an integrated network infrastructure that also provides
    for the last mile to bring the data to the user, and this is through APIs. We
    recommend, ceteris paribus*,* that you consider using the same company that runs
    your relational databases or ERP, as your team will be familiar with that architecture.

    supporting the BC network may not always be available or reliable or provide bandwidth.
    A significant concern when implementing BC technology in cargo shipments is its
    dependence on a continuous connection to the fabric environment. However, HLF
    is a robust distributed database (ledger) that has many copies of itself.

    all times or to consistently re-upload the ledger to peer nodes to have a constant

    have an update of its BC once reliable network is reestablished.

- en: The Issue of Governance
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Figure [4](#Fig4) showed a simple notational circle labeled “Governance,” but
    this issue is far from simple and is the key to any implementation of BC in support
    of data. While a detailed discussion of governance is beyond the scope of this
    paper, Gaur and Gaur [[17](#CR17)] presented a variety of frameworks, some of
    which would apply to permissioned BC networks. Previous discussions of BC governance
    tended to be about public BCs supporting cyber currencies. They noted that while
    BC is about decentralization, there will have to be some aspects of centralized
    governance—especially ones involving policy and legal aspects in the storage and
    use of data. For example, governance could include safeguards through smart contracts
    that could flag possible AI bias, especially ones used for human resources. Governance
    can consist of different layers, and one classification recognizes different levels
    the data serves and is classified as strategic, operational, and tactical governance.
    Since BC is decentralized by nature, the governance should be at the lowest level
    if diversity and flexibility are important. Ziolkowski et al. [[18](#CR18)] looked
    at governance that includes demand and data management, system architecture design
    and development, membership, and data ownership. Each one represents a possible
    off- or on-chain solution that involves technical and policy considerations—both
    of which may include smart contracts as solutions and resources [[19](#CR19)].
    System architecture design and development are not trivial tasks and are based
    to a great extent on governance and policies. To resolve this, IT network engineers
    must work as part of a consortium to determine the appropriate way to expose their
    peers to other organizations to receive transaction endorsement proposal/simulation
    requests while minimizing an attacker’s ability to gain access to sensitive information
    stored in the simulating peer’s database [[19](#CR19)]. The level of rigor is
    ultimately determined by the policies derived by governance. Data accessibility
    is also a key, so governance should have policies that allow scientists working
    for the DoD to find data not through randomness but structure, without undue delay,
    and data that complies with software safety. BC supporting “smart repositories”
    may facilitate this goal. The default should be to allow our data scientists and
    analysts timely access to data unless there is a good reason not to. Our adversaries
    work for AI superiority, and withholding data from their researchers is something
    they avoid. We refer to unclassified and non-PII/medical data.
