    of information. However, this transfer of confidential data involved third parties
    ensuring secure transfer. As a result with passing time and increasing volumes
    of data, the secure transfer of assets was liquidated and somehow all personal
    data could be retrieved from the Internet either through ethical or unethical
    means [[1](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00001)]. Recent times have noted a rapid change in
    the world in terms of the rising digital transformation in almost all walks of
    life [[2](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00002)]. Industries have also noted a significant movement
    towards digital initiatives like the digital twin [[3](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00003)
    –[6](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00006)] to provide timely and quality services to the customer.
    This altered business model is actually an attempt to optimize operations to improve
    the overall customer experience. The new generation popularly known as the millennials
    are catalyzing this new trend. They prefer to use assets, products and processes
    as services rather than owning and maintaining them. It is estimated that by the
    turn of this decade the number of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices will
    be over 20 billion across the globe [[3](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00003)]. These networked
    devices shall sustain millions of digital twins with important data. The digital
    twin technology amalgamates physical units with their virtually premeditated twins.
    It is actually mapping a physical entity with its digital image to enhance the
    performance and behavior of installed physical machines. It helps reduce downtime
    and increase performance. Digital twin technology is actually enabling the digital
    transformation of the entire society to facilitate competence and transparency
    in almost all endeavors of human life [[2](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00002)]. The digital
    twin is not a recent model, it has existed for several years and more lately has
    witnessed greater implementation from the perspective of machines where the digital
    copy of the machine (combining CAD/CAE technology, IoT and analytics) “lives”
    in conjunction with the physical machine and helps proactively foresee the need
    for repairs, potential improvement for enhanced performance, augmentation of the
    product line, etc. [[7](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00007)].

    paradigm for the detection, evaluation and transmission of distinct units of all
    human activity at a greater magnitude than what has been achievable before. It
    is predicted that blockchains could significantly facilitate the application of
    digital twins in IoT [[7](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00007)]. The application of blockchain
    to digital twin is being termed as the rebirth of digital twin [[7](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00007)].
    To truly leverage the benefits of digital twins in an IoT-enabled ecosystem a
    technology to transparently handle data-based transactions in a secure manner
    is desirable. Blockchain enables data exchange among multiple parties within a
    network, applying encrypted identities through peer-to-peer communication. The
    technology is expected to drive radical changes in varied sectors like enterprises,
    services and industries. It enables security through its built-in encryption mechanism
    while providing decentralized, transparent data access through immutable blockchain
    blocks. Hence the participating entities can trace past transactions any time
    through a secure and failure-free mechanism.

    as of now there is no universal, standardized mechanism implementing a digital
    twin. Currently, most information generated within the IoT ecosystem is stored
    in fragmented data silos. This fragmentation needs to be abolished and replaced
    by an integrated ledger technology, like the blockchain, in order to truly leverage

    as well as interest due to its inherent characteristics like immutability, decentralization
    and time-stamped record storage [[8](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00008)]. Simply defined
    a blockchain is “a pooled, distributed, immutable ledger that assists the practice
    of recording transactions and trailing assets in a net of business connections”
    [[9](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00009) –[11](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00011)]. Initially developed
    by Nakamoto (2008) as a technology to support the Bitcoin cryptocurrency the technology
    has already demonstrated its potential for widespread adoption in varied industries
    [[9](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00009), [12](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00012), ]. The technology
    is not just useful in moving capital; it can help in the transaction of any asset
    in a transparent, trustworthy way [[13](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00013)]. It creates an
    everlasting and transparent record of transactions while preventing intractable
    inhibitors across businesses [[14](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00014)]. Based on a peer-to-peer
    transmission operation network, transparent and cryptographically protected information
    facilitates smart contracts [[15](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00015)]. Rightly termed as
    the new paradigm for this decade, it holds the potential of realizing the connected
    world of computing through blockchain cryptography [[16](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00016)].
    As per Deloitte and Austrian blockchain solution provider RIDDLE&CODE, “Blockchain
    technology is the most appropriate and competent means to create, examine and
    trade digital twins” [[17](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00017)]. In itself blockchain is an
    innovation that promises to be as disturbing as the Internet. The innovation enables
    decentralized, tamper-proof, community ownership of transaction records [[18](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00018)].

    along with the blockchain [[19](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00019)]. They actually imply
    multidevice computing that comprises wearable computing, laptops, smartphones,
    Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, smart homes, self-tracking devices (e.g. Fitbit)
    and smart cities. Blockchains can aid effective transfer of important information
    as well as efficient resource allocation in this connected world through smart
    contracts. These automatically accomplished contracts can perk up multiple operations
    in the public as well as private sector while eradicating the middleman [[15](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00015)].
    Blockchains constitute a multifaceted platform capable of catering to diverse
    parties in a transparent and secure data transaction [[18](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00018),
    [20](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00020), ]. It enables a trusted network between varied participating
    entities that share information to enable a transaction [[21](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00021)].
    Through its indigenous features like a common, compatible protocol and data sharing
    through a common distributed ledger platform blockchain also enables interaction
    between all connected applications in different IoT ecosystems [[11](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00011),
    [14](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00014), [15](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00015), [18](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00018),
    [22](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00022), [23](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00023), ]. To enable multi-stakeholder
    interactions among uniquely tokenized digital twins demands a comprehensible,
    competent platform with ample infrastructure facilities. [Figure 10.1](chapter10.xhtml#fig10.1)

    to transform global economies by helping create and control digital replicas of
    all physical as well as logical assets, processes and frameworks as well as humans.
    A blockchain can serve as the backbone for such a system as it is an independent
    system without intermediaries. It is implemented through smart contracts in a
    peer-to-peer mechanism with built-in encryption as well as complete traceability
    of each data block. The technology has several inherent benefits like transaction
    transparency, fraud and manipulation control, corruption elimination, reduced
    costs, higher trust, lesser human errors, privacy, reliability and security among
    others [[15](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00015), [24](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00024), ].'

    4.0 and the confluence of digital and physical worlds, supply chain dynamics has
    undergone complete transformation. The new open chain mechanism of supply chain
    operations better known as the digital supply network is actually the basis for
    future competition in the manufacturing industry. However, to completely comprehend
    these, digital supply network firms need to provide parallel integration through
    the innumerable operational systems that influence the business; vertical integration
    through the associated manufacturing systems; and end-to-end, holistic amalgamation
    through the entire value chain. Together this integration is known as the smart
    factory that enables greater value both within the factory and across the supply
    network. The smart factory enables a fully connected, flexible system that utilizes
    a constant stream of data from connected operations and production systems to
    adapt to new demands through the digital twin. The resultant is a flexible, agile
    system with higher efficiency and reduced downtime. Such a system can self-optimize
    performance across a broader network, self-adapt to and learn from dynamic conditions
    in real-time and autonomously run the entire production process. Hence, such a
    system can evolve and grow with the changing needs of the organization. [Figure

    humans. However, if such a digital replica is built on traditional technologies,
    it will hold all data in a central repository which would require guarding along
    with analytics to provide guarded predictions. To overcome the additional security
    costs blockchains provide a viable alternative. Blockchains enable the creation
    of identities on an immutable ledger with no centralized owner. Such self-sovereign
    identity is capable of deciding who gets access to their data and can also track
    all those who accessed it. For example: The Hyperledger Indy blockchain platform
    enables the creation of such identities. Such a blockchain network is generally
    constituted by the data owner (individual), the data attester (university that
    issued the qualification certificates) and the data requestor, say the employer.
    Governance of such a network can be democratic and each access to data can be
    authorized by the data owner. This ability to create digital replicas of citizens
    holds the potential to transform the global economy. Many governments across the
    globe are investing large amounts in blockchain-enabled initiatives like self-sovereign
    identities, ownership registration for movable assets, verification, etc. Blockchain-enabled
    human digital twins are going to be a vital component in realizing and implementing
    all such initiatives [[64](#re_TNF-CH010_CIT00064)]. [Table 10.2](chapter10.xhtml#T10.2)

    implemented in varied industrial sectors and domains. Together they are instrumental
    in realizing the new industry 4.0 revolution. However their implementation has
    always faced technical as well as financial limitations. As the number and volume
    of IoT devices increase, the technical and financial challenges diminish. However,
    for the relatively novel digital twin platform we need to realize that they are
    just not an academic modeling exercise. Digital twins are created for specific
    outcomes or what may be termed as key performance indicators (KPI). These KPIs
    are integral to deciding issues like maintaining a specific quality of service,
    predicting component lives to reduce downtime, etc. However, an integrated, stable
    underlying platform was missing till now. The underlying distributed ledger technology
    of a blockchain offers immutability and transparency as well security benefits
    for its participating entities. Hence, blockchain has emerged as a promising underlying
    platform to realize an effective and efficient digital twin. Instead it can be
    appropriately termed that digital twins are the technology of the future which
    hold the potential of transforming corporate as well as human life.
