  zh: 代币化的游戏开始了
- en: Tokens enable the exchange of value and have done so for centuries. They date
    back two to three millennia to the use of cowry shells as a form of payment in
    the trade networks of Africa and Asia. The shells had inherent value as physical
    adornments, as did the gold and silver coins that succeeded them. As currency
    and banking systems evolved over centuries, tokens with inherent value were replaced
    by fiat currencies, whose value was defined by governments.[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en1)

  zh: 代币能够交换价值，几个世纪以来一直如此。它们可以追溯到两三千年前，非洲和亚洲贸易网络中使用贝壳作为支付形式。这些贝壳具有作为物理装饰的内在价值，金银币的出现取代了它们。随着货币和银行体系在几个世纪的演变，具有内在价值的代币被法定货币取代，其价值由政府定义。
- en: Fiat has brought widespread benefits in the form of economic stability and safety,
    but it has limits. Among the most relevant drawbacks to digital environments are
    its physical form and denomination—fiat transactions have a literal low end (in
    US denominations of $0.01) and a practical low end somewhat higher because of
    the centralized nature and costly infrastructure underlying the global payments
    system.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en2) Yet small transactions are becoming more
    common as devices and sensors enable the exchange of individual pieces of data,
    watts of energy, or minutes of attention. These digital, machine-based microtransactions,
    which need to be executed in real time at a macro scale, are not something traditional
    payment systems were designed to do.

  zh: 虽然法币在经济稳定和安全方面带来了广泛的好处，但它也有局限性。在数字环境中，最相关的缺点之一是其物理形式和面额——法定交易有一个字面上的低端（以美元面额为0.01美元），以及一个实际上较高的低端，因为全球支付系统的基础是集中式的且成本高昂的基础设施。然而，随着设备和传感器使得个别数据片段、能量瓦特或注意力分钟的交换变得越来越普遍，小额交易也变得越来越常见。这些数字、基于机器的微交易需要在宏观尺度上实时执行，而这并不是传统支付系统设计的目的所在。
- en: These limits began driving an embrace of digital tokens long before blockchain
    came to the fore. Beginning in the 2000s, urban dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa
    began sending cell phone minutes instead of cash to family members living in remote
    rural villages.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en3) Years later in Zimbabwe, after
    hyperinflation had severely devalued the national currency, store owners began
    giving minutes instead of change.[⁴](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en4) When used as
    units of trade, cell minutes became tokens of value, useful beyond their original
    purpose.

- en: 'This flexibility is an attractive quality for users of tokens, if not for their
    issuers. The Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent saw how users seek
    flexibility firsthand in the mid-2000s, when packs of Q coins began appearing
    for sale on Taobao, China’s answer to eBay. Q coins are a virtual currency issued
    by Tencent as payment on its messaging and gaming service, Tencent QQ. Officially,
    gamers were supposed to use Q coins to buy resources for their avatars. But shortly
    after the tokens launched in 2002, people started to use them outside the Tencent
    ecosystem. First, other online gaming companies began accepting them. Then Q coins
    became an alternative peer-to-peer payment mechanism. Later they appeared as a
    payment option for black-market services such as gambling or prostitution. The
    trade in virtual currency had reached $2 billion per year in China by 2009, when
    the People’s Bank of China stopped allowing the use of Q coins for purchases of
    real goods and services and eventually stopped all Q coin trading between QQ account
    holders.[⁵](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en5) But the message from the market was clear:
    Q coins revealed the demand digital users have for a safe and flexible way to
    exchange value in digital environments. The explosion in interest in tokens—including
    cryptocurrencies—shows that demand has only grown.'

- en: '*Fiat tokens* represent centrally issued government currencies such as the
    euro, the US dollar, or the Chinese renminbi and are used to facilitate the exchange
    of goods and services. These tokens are best known for their physical forms, including
    cash notes and coins, precious metals, and commodities. This physical form limits

- en: '*Process tokens* extend the reach of fiat by encapsulating a process necessary
    to use them in digital environments. For example, EMVCo tokens often reside inside
    smartphones and represent bank or debit or credit card account information; these
    are used to facilitate transactions in remote environments. Likewise, Facebook
    access tokens are issued to third-party apps when users click the “Sign in with
    your Facebook login” function; these tokens similarly encapsulate user sign-in
    credentials.'

- en: '*Complementary tokens* act as a medium of exchange in closed or otherwise limited
    contexts. Examples include reward points from airlines, hotel loyalty programs,
    or known brands like Starbucks Stars and Uber cash. Other examples are digital
    currencies such as Amazon coins or Q coins. Towns such as Brixton in the United
    Kingdom have also issued complementary currencies—in this case, the Brixton pound—to
    support local small businesses. Another geographic example of a complementary
    currency is the *fureai kippu* in Japan, a social service currency that people
    earn when performing an act of volunteer charity. Complementary tokens historically
    have filled in gaps where fiat tokens did not provide sufficient incentive over
    the terms and conditions of doing business to the issuer, and for economic and
    regulatory rationales.'

    kippu*，这是一种社会服务货币，人们在进行志愿慈善行为时获得。补充代币在历史上填补了法定代币未能提供足够激励的空白，促使发行者同意交易条件，并为经济和监管理由。'
- en: '*Cryptocurrencies* are digitally native currencies that replace fiat and process
    tokens and can be used to create new forms of assets. Cryptocurrencies come in
    several forms. *Utility tokens* are intended as a crowdfunding method to finance
    the development of a product or service and as an access mechanism to the resulting
    solution. *Security tokens* give their holders a share in the issuing entity,
    much as a stockholder has a share in a publicly traded company. *Stablecoins*
    are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a second asset (a fiat currency,
    for example), a publicly traded commodity, or another cryptocurrency.'

    them. Cryptocurrencies can also trade units of data, certifications, or IP. The

    a misleading impression about the whole category.

    Imagine that a digital platform like Travelocity or Expedia, or even Facebook,
    would use tokens to support vacation planning. If that were the case, planning
    would start as it does now, with the customer making basic decisions about when,
    where, and who to travel with. The customer might likewise consider other details
    such as hotel or airline preferences, favorite kinds of food or restaurants, and
    interesting excursions. In the brick-and-mortar world, travelers share this information
    with their human travel agent. On the internet, they use the templates available
    on travel brokerage websites. These sites function as data brokers, since they
    use customer information to attract marketers in the various travel silos and
    generate revenue. In our tokenized environment, the information about the traveler’s

    by the vendors providing travel services, including airlines, hotels, restaurants,
    tour providers, and the like. Those vendors would respond in tokenized form with

    这些供应商将以令牌化形式回应产品提供。 供应商发行的令牌被捕获在由数据经纪人管理的钱包中（图中的第2步）。
- en: In step 3, the traveler begins paying for and consuming the services, using
    the vendor-issued tokens while on the trip, for example, checking into the hotel
    and consuming services there. Tokens could continue to play a role while the traveler
    is on vacation (as in step 4). For example, when the traveler accepts an offer
    of an extra night from the hotel, the offer could come with extra tokens to use
    for room service, for a drink at the hotel bar, or for a room upgrade. In these
    contexts, the tokens encourage travelers to stay within the provider’s commercial

    reviews, and tour raves to various social media feeds, which could include the
    data broker (step 5). The data broker coordinates with the vendors to encourage
    these word-of-mouth reviews by tokenizing an offer of a free night or a free meal
    in exchange for a review. The traveler can save these tokens for another trip,
    use them at a different location owned by the provider, or share the tokens via
    the digital wallet with friends who decide to follow in the traveler’s footsteps
    (step 6).

  zh: 迄今为止，我们专注于数字和物理环境中令牌采用的各种形式，但没有区块链的好处。此外，当令牌在区块链中使用时，它们被设计用于至少满足三个目的。
- en: First, they can *maximize existing value* for the issuer. When a token’s purpose
    is to maximize value, the token encourages customers to take actions that directly
    or indirectly benefit the issuer. Reward points, identity tokens, and tokenized
    KYC information are all examples of how a company might tokenize an existing resource
    and manage it within a blockchain to easily issue it, track it, and allow owners
    to use it. The goal is to increase customer convenience or reduce friction to
    enable more loyalty or trade. In the vacation example, when the hotel provides
    tokens as a reward to travelers who accept additional offers such as a room upgrade,
    those tokens maximize value.
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，它们可以*最大化发行者的现有价值*。当令牌的目的是最大化价值时，令牌鼓励客户采取直接或间接使发行者受益的行动。奖励点、身份令牌和令牌化的KYC信息都是公司可能将现有资源令牌化并在区块链中进行管理以便于发行、跟踪和允许所有者使用的示例。目标是增加客户便利性或减少摩擦力，以促进更多的忠诚度或贸易。在度假的例子中，当酒店向接受额外优惠的旅行者提供令牌作为奖励时，比如房间升级，这些令牌最大化了价值。
- en: Second, a token can *represent value*. Cryptocurrencies can be thought of as
    representations of value. Most literally, bitcoin represents the value of electricity
    and computational resources used by bitcoin “miners”[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch4-fna)
    that run the algorithm that authenticates users and validates transactions.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en6)
    With bitcoin, because tokens are also the incentives for miners’ participation
    in operating the network, tokens also maximize value.

  zh: 其次，令牌可以*代表价值*。加密货币可以被视为价值的代表。最直接的是，比特币代表了比特币“矿工”[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch4-fna)所使用的电力和计算资源的价值，这些矿工运行验证用户并验证交易的算法。[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en6)
    使用比特币时，因为令牌也是矿工参与网络运作的激励措施，令牌也最大化了价值。
- en: While bitcoin is also an accepted mode of payment on some digital commerce sites,
    most bitcoin trading is done by currency speculators who value the currency for
    what it’s worth in relation to the US dollar or other foreign exchange currencies—in
    other words, for what it represents in fiat.[⁷](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en7) Beyond
    bitcoin, the cryptocurrencies that allow blockchain network participants to transact
    a real-world asset or a share in one (such as an energy co-op, an investment security,
    or a real estate property) represent value. Turning again to the travel example,
    when the vendors tokenize offers such as a hotel room package, they are creating
    tokens that represent value for their holders, since the tokens are tradable for
    an asset or a service.
  id: totrans-31

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 虽然比特币也是一些数字商务网站上被接受的支付方式，但大多数比特币交易是由货币投机者完成的，他们根据比特币相对于美元或其他外汇货币的价值进行交易，换句话说，他们将其视为法定货币价值。[⁷](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en7)
    除了比特币之外，那些允许区块链网络参与者交易现实世界资产或其份额（例如能源合作社、投资证券或房地产）的加密货币都代表着价值。再次回到旅行的例子，当供应商将酒店房间套餐等优惠进行代币化时，他们正在创造代表持有者价值的代币，因为这些代币可以交易为资产或服务。
- en: Finally, tokens can *create a new type of value* with a blockchain. For example,
    tokens can allow participants to monetize formerly unmonetizable or illiquid assets.
    As Roman Cheng, the president of Taipei Fubon Bank, stressed, “Blockchain creates
    an ability to introduce asset-backed tokens such as with the account receivables
    due to the various tiers of suppliers of a large corporate buyer’s supply-chain
    ecosystem. And [it] therefore creates powerful financial tools for these [small
    and medium-sized enterprises].”[⁸](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en8) Another timely
    example of tokens that fulfill this purpose can be seen in emerging digital asset
    markets focused on the exchange of data. Some of these markets will allow users
    to tokenize their personal or corporate data and actively sell it according to
    its market value or share it with approved parties.

  zh: 最后，代币可以*创造一种全新的价值类型*，并与区块链相结合。例如，代币可以允许参与者将以往无法货币化或流动性不足的资产进行货币化。正如台北富邦银行总裁罗曼·郑所强调的那样，“区块链创造了一种能够引入基于资产的代币的能力，例如，通过大型企业采购供应链生态系统的各个层次的供应商所产生的应收账款。因此，为这些[中小企业]创造了强大的金融工具。”[⁸](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en8)
    其他及时的代币实例可以在专注于数据交换的新兴数字资产市场中看到。其中一些市场将允许用户对其个人或公司数据进行代币化，并根据其市场价值积极出售或与经批准的方进行共享。
- en: Edgecoin, for example, has a blockchain solution for education credentials that
    allows universities to digitalize their student records and provide graduates
    with a certified tokenized copy to share with employers or other education institutions.
    Another blockchain provider using tokens to facilitate the exchange of data assets
    is ClimateCoin, a nonprofit working to make the carbon offset markets developed
    for institutions and governments accessible to individuals. The ClimateCoin CO2

- en: Whether their purpose is to maximize value, represent value, or create a new
    type of value, tokens are, for many enthusiasts, the main point of blockchain,
    since demand for a particular form of value (what the token represents or the
    value it creates) motivates the creation of a network and participation in it.
    Neither the size, the liquidity, nor the worth of a tokenized asset is bound at
    the high or low ends, and participants in the network can be machines. Tokens
    thus enable economic activity to expand dramatically to theoretically include
    every human and machine in existence and every tradable resource.

- en: 'Nevertheless, the hype around initial coin offerings (ICOs) has added to the
    confusion and warrants a brief mention. An ICO purportedly raises funds in an
    open-source environment for a blockchain-based initiative. As part of the ICO,
    a company issues tokens on a blockchain platform and uses smart contracts—lines
    of code that automatically execute the terms of an agreement—to manage the coin
    offering and define the rules. Although currency speculation and scamming have
    been a factor in many ICOs, those launched with genuine intent come with the expectation
    that token holders will get access to the platform or capability under development.
    In this way, the token plays a dual role for the issuer: it represents value,
    since buyers pay for them with fiat currency, and it can create value in the way
    it attracts users to a blockchain solution. We go into more detail on ICOs and
    the decentralization of finance in [chapter 6](../Text/chapter06.html).'

    ICO 中都是一个因素，但那些以真诚意图启动的 ICO 带来的期望是，代币持有人将获得对正在开发中的平台或功能的访问权限。这样，代币对发行者起着双重作用：它代表价值，因为买家用法定货币购买它们，它还可以通过吸引用户到区块链解决方案上来创造价值。我们将在

- en: Stablecoins, or stable cryptocurrencies, are another source of confusion. They
    aim to match the digital benefits of a cryptocurrency, but without the volatility
    that plagues market-traded cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and that deters enterprise
    users wary of risk. Stablecoins try to mitigate volatility by pegging their value
    to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, and holding off-chain a certain amount
    of reserve currency. Issuers of stablecoins must adjust the supply of tokens to
    match the reserve. Fiat-currency-backed stablecoins tend to be centralized, because
    their target monetary variable is centralized. And their use augments one central
    legacy actor (the government or its agent, a central bank) with another—and one
    that may be less stable or less reputable and therefore less credible than a central
    bank. To avoid inherent centralization, a stablecoin might peg its value to a
    portfolio of cryptocurrencies via smart contracts. Another option is to replicate
    the actions of a central bank with an algorithm and smart contract to manage trading
    in a way that decreases volatility.

  zh: 稳定币，或稳定加密货币，是另一个令人困惑的来源。它们旨在匹配加密货币的数字好处，但避免了市场交易加密货币（如比特币）所困扰的波动性，并阻止了对风险警惕的企业用户。稳定币试图通过将其价值锚定在法定货币（如美元）上，并持有某种数量的储备货币来减轻波动性。稳定币的发行方必须调整代币的供应以匹配储备。以法定货币支持的稳定币往往是中心化的，因为它们的目标货币变量是中心化的。它们的使用增加了一个中心化的遗留参与者（政府或其代理机构，即央行）和另一个可能不太稳定或不太有声誉的参与者，因此可能不太可信赖的中心化参与者。为了避免固有的中心化，稳定币可能会通过智能合约将其价值锚定在一篮子加密货币上。另一个选择是通过算法和智能合约复制央行的行动，以管理交易的方式降低波动性。

    and modes of exchange (the southwest quadrant). These tokens are playing a tactical
    role. More strategic use of tokens is underway now. A token that is both centralized
    in design and programmable will afford the issuer a high degree of control. To
    build adoption, a digital ecosystem might embrace some aspects of decentralization
    in the initial token implementation. The decentralization elements are likely
    to be temporary, however, since the objective is *control* (the northwest quadrant
    of the figure). Once token adoption reaches critical mass—and lock-in—we predict
    that the use of the token in a centralized context will evolve to have more restrictions
    and therefore become more centralized. For example, Uber Pro (the reward program
    for Uber drivers) has some programmability in its tokens but also a high level
    of control by Uber, as only drivers with a satisfaction rating of at least 4.85
    and a low cancellation rate can participate.[^(27)](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en27)
    The token will only be slightly decentralized because the rules of access aim
    to influence the behavior of both customers and business partners inside Uber’s

    Instead of a central authority, the design of blockchain gives each participant
    in the network *one equal vote* on whether other participants are authentic and
    transactions are valid, according to the business rules that dictate interactions
    on the blockchain. Participants, can operate as nodes, which are the machines
    owned or used by participants to run a blockchain consensus algorithm each time
    a block of transactions passes through.[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch5-fna) If
    at least 51 percent of the full network nodes conclude that a transaction is good,
    it gets cleared and then appended independently by each node to its copy of the
    ledger.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en3) Duplications, double-counted assets, and
    fraudulent transactions that one node might miss or intentionally overlook are
    unlikely to be missed by the consensus. The one node, one vote, policy is *the
    way* that blockchain gets around the challenge of authentication and validation
    in the absence of a centralized authority.

    contain all the business rules needed to operate a business, and the interactions,
    transactions, and value created by the DAO won’t have a physical-world equivalent.
    As an independent business, a DAO will make all the decisions and execute all

    on goals and decide to divide into two separate networks (e.g., Bitcoin and Bitcoin

    coordinated through a decentralized architecture—offers a useful view of how a
    network evolves its decentralized architecture over time. Because of the open,
    peer-to-peer nature of blockchain, nodes enter and exit as they choose and the
    technology architecture and the network governance change with those entrances
    and exits. The reward mechanism of Bitcoin, whereby full nodes are compensated
    with bitcoin for the work they do maintaining the network and running the consensus,
    contributes to this trend. Nodes are said to *mine* bitcoin, and the people who
    run nodes are referred to as *miners*. As the ledger grows, miners need more power
    executing at greater speed to run the consensus. With bitcoin, miners with the
    most scalable and cost-efficient operations can mine faster than others. This
    difference results in market consolidation. The decline in the value of bitcoin
    compounds the issue by making the rewards no longer worth the work for less efficient
    miners. They drop out of the mining pool. All this results in the centralization
    of mining; today, four mining pools run more than 50 percent of the Bitcoin network.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en6)

    for a separate negotiation of access and control over data in digital contexts.
    As we demonstrated in [chapter 4](../Text/chapter04.html), tokenization allows
    participants—whether they are people, organizations, or things—to capture data
    in a tradable form and then share it in whole or in part with counterparties to
    generate new sources of revenue. Combining tokenization with decentralization
    gives participants control over how they share that information and allows the
    value from that exchange to accrue to them. There is no third party to negotiate
    a data exchange without the knowledge of the data owner. In a decentralized environment,
    complementary technologies such as identity and access management tools and confidentiality
    systems like zero-knowledge proofs give participants even tighter reins on the
    information they share, who they share it with and how they share it.[^b](../Text/footnotes.html#ch5-fnb)
    For example, enterprises can guarantee that confidential data has been delivered
    to another party without sharing the details of the underlying information. This
    capability would have wide-ranging implications for every industry sector. In
    the corporate banking segment of the financial services industry, trade finance
    is one domain using such methods to improve the process of issuing purchase orders.
    Through the use of platforms such as eTradeConnect, financial institutions can

    saw an opportunity to experiment with a new technology, address a known problem,
    and engage with its commercial bank stakeholders. The blockchain it developed
    was inspired in design, and the solution the new technology offered was basic;
    a secure digital portal could have achieved the same end. But the bank sees broader
    benefits for collaboration and the eventual decentralization of interbank processes.
    Officers we spoke to at Banque de France said the project created a new level
    of engagement between the Banque de France and the commercial banking community
    it serves. The project also allowed everyone to understand how decentralization

    it, the vision is to have an open community model that enables more decentralized
    development, shared costs, and the ability to build new complementary solutions.
    He compared it to open-source projects like those hosted on GitHub; in the case
    of Banque de France and its customers, the application’s code could be open-sourced
    and accessible by participating banks. Although the original blockchain was built
    for France, SEPA credential IDs apply to creditors across the eurozone. Likewise,
    KYC credentialing uses some of the same information, enabling complementary use
    cases that would exploit the same platform. Together, these factors point to opportunities
    for European central banks to collaborate on a more progressively decentralized
    blockchain credentialing model.

    decentralization through blockchain is the Union of European Football Associations
    (UEFA), the European governing body for the Federacíon Internationale de Fútbol
    Associación (FIFA).[^(16)](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en16) UEFA organizes some of
    the most prestigious pan-European football competitions, including the annual
    Champions League tournament. Tickets for UEFA events are in high demand, and there
    is a robust, decentralized secondary market for reselling them—scalping, basically.
    UEFA estimates that only 37 percent of tickets go to primary buyers; the rest
    go to resellers and sponsors.
  id: totrans-186

- en: Secondary sales create several problems for UEFA. One is security. The union
    loses the record of who enters its event facilities when the person who uses the
    ticket is not the person who bought it. The ongoing problem of sports-related
    hooliganism and rising concerns about terrorism have made the identification of
    ticket users a pressing issue.[^(17)](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en17) Price gouging
    is another concern. Tickets sell out quickly to bots (or brokers) that swamp official
    channels. Those tickets then appear on secondary markets at precipitously higher
    prices. UEFA takes the brand hit when the average family can’t afford tickets
    to a football match, but none of the money goes to UEFA or the teams. Instead,
    it goes to the ticket brokers, some of which are associated with organized crime.
    Two more issues are counterfeiting, when a scalper sells a fake ticket, and double-counting,
    when a scalper sells the same ticket to multiple buyers.

    to stop secondary sales altogether but to limit their negative aspects by using
    a decentralized economic market. To this end, UEFA is turning to blockchain.

    an owner wants to give a ticket away to a friend or family member, he or she can
    do that through the app, which sends the record of the transfer to the blockchain.
    When a ticket holder wants to put the ticket on the open market, things get interesting.
    SecuTix and TIXnGO have developed the capability for a secondary market to operate
    inside the blockchain app. The SecuTix platform defines the markup resellers are
    allowed to charge. This practice prevents price gouging and limits the incentives
    illegal brokers have to participate but maintains the decentralized environment

    brokers—to sell to willing buyers.

    to data quality. Blockchain is popularly referred to as the *truth machine*, a

    data over time about what customers look at or buy and then executing on this
    insight. Granted, this data includes quite a few products, and the number is constantly
    growing, but it is still only a part of total customer needs and preferences.
    Who among us hasn’t had the experience of looking at a peripherally interesting
    product on a web platform, only to have ads for that product follow you around

    solutions could disrupt the market power of digital platforms while also improving
    trust and allowing widespread opportunity and participation. The consensus algorithm
    enables “truth” in blockchain-complete solutions. The algorithm will reject transactions
    based on what it perceives as inaccurate or unverifiable data, and it allows participants
    to transact, even if they don’t implicitly know or trust their counterparts. Participants
    who don’t follow the blockchain’s rules won’t be authorized to transact. Transactions
    that go against those rules won’t be validated. In addition, record immutability
    allows a participant to access the transaction record to settle any postsettlement
    dispute. Blockchain-inspired solutions don’t necessarily have those safety mechanisms,
    or if they do, they are more costly and cumbersome.

    in the form of fairness, in particular as it applies to fair participation and
    access. Anyone or anything can interact or transact in a blockchain-complete network
    as long as the party adheres to the shared rules of the network. In this way,
    blockchain-complete solutions realize the promise of equal access that was part
    of the World Wide Web at its inception. We are far from that promise today, given
    the power of digital platforms to act as gatekeepers.[⁴](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en4)
    To increase their revenue, platforms must capture as much data as possible and
    limit access competitors may have to the same resources. That capture and control
    creates a motivation to reverse decentralization (see [figure 6-1](#fig6-1)).
    Blockchain solutions, in contrast, expand the range of participants to anyone
    who sees value. Although blockchain does not necessarily produce a green field
    with wide-open participation, it can increase participation and encourage the
    fair distribution of benefits.

    ability to do so. Efficient, secure, and private sharing of identifying information
    strongly encourages participation. Portable and decentralized identity credentials
    will serve as the standard way that blockchain-complete solutions capture and
    share participant information. In a blockchain-complete environment, these credentials
    are often tokens that capture a user’s relevant information. (The technical approach
    to capturing credentials will change further along the spectrum.) The tokens may
    be stored in a digital wallet. Data owners can then share their tokens for single
    use by designated trading partners. Security clearance is one application for

    with representatives from the Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH), which

    to give patients control over their “health passport” to improve document protection
    and enable more efficient information sharing. After patients’ consent is captured
    in a smart contract, providers can access reports of medical tests ordered by
    another physician in the hospital and thereby prevent unnecessary duplication
    of tests. Patients can also share their passport with care providers who work
    outside the hospital system. According to the superintendent of the TMUH, Dr.
    Ray-Jade Chen, “the benefits in efficiency alone have been staggering, even for
    the small number of pilot patients on the system. It used to take three weeks
    for a health record exchange; now that same exchange can take place within three
    hours. Likewise, out-of-pocket health-care expenses get reimbursed faster by insurers
    because the necessary exchange of data is more complete and efficient.”[⁷](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en7)

    having a health record that is portable across providers and payers. For businesses,
    a portable license or credential could dramatically decrease the cost of doing
    business. Instead of undergoing separate credentialing processes for each channel
    partner, a business could document the relevant details once, store them in an
    identity token, and share them across networks. Smaller, local, or specialized
    companies could thereby expand their market access. Rather than concentrate their
    digital activity on one platform, businesses and individuals could participate
    across platforms and spread access to their data across them.

    of finance. Crowdfunding platforms offer one model with significant traction.
    Examples of these platforms include 51Give, Ketto, Indiegogo, and Kickstarter,
    or even Kiva for microlending. In 2017, crowdfunding platforms raised an estimated
    $33 billion worldwide.[^(12)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en12) Considering the $84
    billion in venture capital raised by US businesses alone, crowdfunding was clearly
    never intended to replace traditional sources, but rather fills the gaps that
    traditional finance does not serve.[^(13)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en13)

    coin offerings (ICOs) executed on a blockchain. As discussed in [chapter 4](../Text/chapter04.html),
    ICOs were one of the first widespread applications of tokens in blockchain solutions.
    Mastercoin—a cryptocurrency built on the Bitcoin blockchain—is thought to have
    launched the first ICO in 2013.[^(14)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en14) Ethereum’s
    ICO followed in 2014 and raised more than $2 million in the first twelve hours.
    In 2017, the ICO market expanded dramatically, with almost nine hundred offerings
    taking place in the calendar year to raise a total of more than $6 billion. In
    2018, there were more than twelve hundred ICOs raising more than $7.5 billion.[^(15)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en15)

    of fair access and value exchange. They do this by expanding financial access
    to a larger variety of aspiring entrepreneurs than could or would be served by
    commercial banks, angel investors, or venture-capital funds and by potentially
    accessing a global capital pool. Improved access extends to the supply side as
    well. ICOs allow any investor to support an entrepreneur at almost any level,
    even in increments smaller than $0.01\. Both sides enjoy a fairer exchange of
    value at a fair price within a system that takes a little bit of money from a
    lot of participants. The use of smart contracts as part of the process also facilitates
    a more accurate and auditable transaction flow. All these elements break the hold
    that the formal financial sector has on capital. Decentralized finance thus drives
    down the cost of capital and enables a more equitable exchange—at least in theory.

    briefly touch on the mechanisms that support blockchain-complete solutions and
    that ensure their fairness and safety for participants. One foundational enabler
    is the smart contract. As explained in our discussion of digital currencies, the
    absence of an explicit contract between users and digital platforms has allowed
    the latter to capture and store unlimited amounts of data. The presence of a contract
    would clarify the terms and specify what the participant gets in exchange. The
    idea of smart contracts originated in 1994 with Nick Szabo, a computer scientist
    and cryptographer credited with designing a precursor to bitcoin.[^(16)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en16)
    Ethereum was one of the first blockchains to employ smart contracts; they are
    now the standard by which many blockchains execute rules.

- en: A simple smart contract captures basic rules and standards to enable an autonomous
    peer-to-peer transaction. More-complex exchanges involving multiple parties or
    complicated flows of information would instead use a more sophisticated bit of
    technology called a *decentralized application*, or *dapp*. Dapps are applications
    that use smart contracts plus added code to enable the exchange of digital assets
    (tokens) involving back-end computation and front-end access. At the risk of oversimplification,
    a smart contract would be used if a transaction were as straightforward as two
    peers exchanging data tokens. A dapp would be used instead to enable, say, an
    insurance claim that disburses money from an insurance carrier to a claimant and
    that involves the exchange and processing of claim information.

    rules have the additional safeguard in a public blockchain of the consensus mechanism
    to ensure they are followed for each transaction equitably. Although the technology
    capturing those rules is still immature, they will eventually serve the same function
    that centralized oversight does today—as a safeguard. In fact, smart contracts,
    dapps, and consensus can be even more effective, cheaper, and faster than the
    centralized and mediated financial system we have today. But there is a significant
    learning curve before that promise is realized, as demonstrated by the DAO project.

    had no organization to speak of and was designed to be entirely consensus driven.
    In May 2016, it raised an impressive $150 million. But the following month, a
    token holder exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract and network code
    and siphoned the equivalent of $50 million. Thanks to a nuance in the network
    rules, the community was able to fork the project’s blockchain, freeze the currency,
    and liquidate the remaining DAO funds to the original investors.

    Security tokens represent an equity investment in a company, analogous to buying
    a share of stock in an IPO. Utility tokens, in contrast, purportedly reserve a
    space in line for the holder to access a technology solution. But few of the early
    ICOs had an associated contract that required the issuing company to produce a
    product. Consequently, many ICOs produced nothing. Even legitimate ideas promoted
    by sincere entrepreneurs can fall prey to ICO manipulation, particularly pump
    and dump campaigns by investors who talk up the coin price and then dump their
    coins on the market, causing a crash in value. Also mixed up with the subject
    of ICOs and manipulation are *cryptocurrency airdrops*, a onetime free distribution
    of tokens to the wallets of specified recipients; airdrops attempt to create liquidity
    and interest in a token and its corresponding blockchain. They are the blockchain

    from 2017 to 2018 was a useful proof of concept for decentralized finance. Adding
    programmability into company ownership radically changes the models for asset
    creation, investment, and exchange. The successes and failures of ICOs show that
    widespread financial disintermediation can expand access to finance and its delivery.
    ICOs even seem to be lucrative for investors. The aforementioned Boston College
    report found that ICO investors netted an average return of 86 percent; the researchers
    also suggest that fraudulent ICOs, though real, had minimum impact, because investors
    spotted them and underfunded those ICOs.

    major mutual fund and hedge fund companies for a range of consumer investing but

    if they are successful, attract users, and begin to consolidate data relevant
    to the business process. They could, alternatively, become more decentralized
    as the decisions managed by the solution are captured in and executed by a smart
    contract. Blockchain-inspired solutions built to be evolutionary or native will
