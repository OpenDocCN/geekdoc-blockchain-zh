    back two to three millennia to the use of cowry shells as a form of payment in
    the trade networks of Africa and Asia. The shells had inherent value as physical
    adornments, as did the gold and silver coins that succeeded them. As currency
    and banking systems evolved over centuries, tokens with inherent value were replaced
    by fiat currencies, whose value was defined by governments.[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en1)

    but it has limits. Among the most relevant drawbacks to digital environments are
    its physical form and denomination—fiat transactions have a literal low end (in
    US denominations of $0.01) and a practical low end somewhat higher because of
    the centralized nature and costly infrastructure underlying the global payments
    system.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en2) Yet small transactions are becoming more
    common as devices and sensors enable the exchange of individual pieces of data,
    watts of energy, or minutes of attention. These digital, machine-based microtransactions,
    which need to be executed in real time at a macro scale, are not something traditional
    payment systems were designed to do.

    issuers. The Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent saw how users seek
    flexibility firsthand in the mid-2000s, when packs of Q coins began appearing
    for sale on Taobao, China’s answer to eBay. Q coins are a virtual currency issued
    by Tencent as payment on its messaging and gaming service, Tencent QQ. Officially,
    gamers were supposed to use Q coins to buy resources for their avatars. But shortly
    after the tokens launched in 2002, people started to use them outside the Tencent
    ecosystem. First, other online gaming companies began accepting them. Then Q coins
    became an alternative peer-to-peer payment mechanism. Later they appeared as a
    payment option for black-market services such as gambling or prostitution. The
    trade in virtual currency had reached $2 billion per year in China by 2009, when
    the People’s Bank of China stopped allowing the use of Q coins for purchases of
    real goods and services and eventually stopped all Q coin trading between QQ account
    holders.[⁵](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en5) But the message from the market was clear:
    Q coins revealed the demand digital users have for a safe and flexible way to

    euro, the US dollar, or the Chinese renminbi and are used to facilitate the exchange
    of goods and services. These tokens are best known for their physical forms, including
    cash notes and coins, precious metals, and commodities. This physical form limits
    their direct use in digital environments.'

    to use them in digital environments. For example, EMVCo tokens often reside inside
    smartphones and represent bank or debit or credit card account information; these
    are used to facilitate transactions in remote environments. Likewise, Facebook
    access tokens are issued to third-party apps when users click the “Sign in with
    your Facebook login” function; these tokens similarly encapsulate user sign-in
    credentials.'

    contexts. Examples include reward points from airlines, hotel loyalty programs,
    or known brands like Starbucks Stars and Uber cash. Other examples are digital
    currencies such as Amazon coins or Q coins. Towns such as Brixton in the United
    Kingdom have also issued complementary currencies—in this case, the Brixton pound—to
    support local small businesses. Another geographic example of a complementary
    currency is the *fureai kippu* in Japan, a social service currency that people
    earn when performing an act of volunteer charity. Complementary tokens historically
    have filled in gaps where fiat tokens did not provide sufficient incentive over
    the terms and conditions of doing business to the issuer, and for economic and
    regulatory rationales.'

    several forms. *Utility tokens* are intended as a crowdfunding method to finance
    the development of a product or service and as an access mechanism to the resulting
    solution. *Security tokens* give their holders a share in the issuing entity,
    much as a stockholder has a share in a publicly traded company. *Stablecoins*
    are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a second asset (a fiat currency,

    The high-profile existence of fraud should not poison the entire category, however.
    Cryptocurrencies are necessary to enable the creation of new forms of digital
    assets and thus new markets. For example, cryptocurrencies enable participants
    to represent illiquid physical assets in digital form, tokenize them, and trade
    them. Cryptocurrencies can also trade units of data, certifications, or IP. The
    cryptocurrency category includes all types of tokens issued or exchanged via a
    blockchain solution; we will note when a given example of a cryptocurrency presents

- en: To see how the different token types operate in a digital environment, let’s
    look at a real-world situation as common as planning a vacation ([figure 4-1](#fig4-1)).
    Imagine that a digital platform like Travelocity or Expedia, or even Facebook,
    would use tokens to support vacation planning. If that were the case, planning
    would start as it does now, with the customer making basic decisions about when,
    where, and who to travel with. The customer might likewise consider other details
    such as hotel or airline preferences, favorite kinds of food or restaurants, and
    interesting excursions. In the brick-and-mortar world, travelers share this information
    with their human travel agent. On the internet, they use the templates available
    on travel brokerage websites. These sites function as data brokers, since they
    use customer information to attract marketers in the various travel silos and
    generate revenue. In our tokenized environment, the information about the traveler’s
    plans goes to one of these data travel brokers (step 1 in [figure 4-1](#fig4-1)).

    and capture it in a tokenized form, thus creating data tokens. In our illustration,
    the tokens are stored in a digital wallet under the control of the data broker.
    There could be different tokens representing different combinations of data needed
    by the vendors providing travel services, including airlines, hotels, restaurants,
    tour providers, and the like. Those vendors would respond in tokenized form with
    product offers. The vendor-issued tokens are captured in the wallet managed by
    the data broker (step 2 in the figure).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In step 3, the traveler begins paying for and consuming the services, using
    the vendor-issued tokens while on the trip, for example, checking into the hotel
    and consuming services there. Tokens could continue to play a role while the traveler
    is on vacation (as in step 4). For example, when the traveler accepts an offer
    of an extra night from the hotel, the offer could come with extra tokens to use
    for room service, for a drink at the hotel bar, or for a room upgrade. In these
    contexts, the tokens encourage travelers to stay within the provider’s commercial
    ecosystem.

    reviews, and tour raves to various social media feeds, which could include the
    data broker (step 5). The data broker coordinates with the vendors to encourage
    these word-of-mouth reviews by tokenizing an offer of a free night or a free meal
    in exchange for a review. The traveler can save these tokens for another trip,
    use them at a different location owned by the provider, or share the tokens via
    the digital wallet with friends who decide to follow in the traveler’s footsteps
    (step 6).

    physical environments absent the benefits of blockchain. When tokens are used
    in a blockchain, furthermore, they are designed to fulfill at least one of three
    purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, they can *maximize existing value* for the issuer. When a token’s purpose
    is to maximize value, the token encourages customers to take actions that directly
    or indirectly benefit the issuer. Reward points, identity tokens, and tokenized
    KYC information are all examples of how a company might tokenize an existing resource
    and manage it within a blockchain to easily issue it, track it, and allow owners
    to use it. The goal is to increase customer convenience or reduce friction to
    enable more loyalty or trade. In the vacation example, when the hotel provides
    tokens as a reward to travelers who accept additional offers such as a room upgrade,
    those tokens maximize value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, a token can *represent value*. Cryptocurrencies can be thought of as
    representations of value. Most literally, bitcoin represents the value of electricity
    and computational resources used by bitcoin “miners”[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch4-fna)
    that run the algorithm that authenticates users and validates transactions.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en6)
    With bitcoin, because tokens are also the incentives for miners’ participation
    in operating the network, tokens also maximize value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While bitcoin is also an accepted mode of payment on some digital commerce sites,
    most bitcoin trading is done by currency speculators who value the currency for
    what it’s worth in relation to the US dollar or other foreign exchange currencies—in
    other words, for what it represents in fiat.[⁷](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en7) Beyond
    bitcoin, the cryptocurrencies that allow blockchain network participants to transact
    a real-world asset or a share in one (such as an energy co-op, an investment security,
    or a real estate property) represent value. Turning again to the travel example,
    when the vendors tokenize offers such as a hotel room package, they are creating
    tokens that represent value for their holders, since the tokens are tradable for
    an asset or a service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, tokens can *create a new type of value* with a blockchain. For example,
    tokens can allow participants to monetize formerly unmonetizable or illiquid assets.
    As Roman Cheng, the president of Taipei Fubon Bank, stressed, “Blockchain creates
    an ability to introduce asset-backed tokens such as with the account receivables
    due to the various tiers of suppliers of a large corporate buyer’s supply-chain
    ecosystem. And [it] therefore creates powerful financial tools for these [small
    and medium-sized enterprises].”[⁸](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en8) Another timely
    example of tokens that fulfill this purpose can be seen in emerging digital asset
    markets focused on the exchange of data. Some of these markets will allow users
    to tokenize their personal or corporate data and actively sell it according to
    its market value or share it with approved parties.

    allows universities to digitalize their student records and provide graduates
    with a certified tokenized copy to share with employers or other education institutions.
    Another blockchain provider using tokens to facilitate the exchange of data assets
    is ClimateCoin, a nonprofit working to make the carbon offset markets developed
    for institutions and governments accessible to individuals. The ClimateCoin CO2
    token can be purchased by anyone, and its proceeds are used to invest in companies
    involved in carbon offsetting activities, such as renewable energy generation.

- en: Whether their purpose is to maximize value, represent value, or create a new
    type of value, tokens are, for many enthusiasts, the main point of blockchain,
    since demand for a particular form of value (what the token represents or the
    value it creates) motivates the creation of a network and participation in it.
    Neither the size, the liquidity, nor the worth of a tokenized asset is bound at
    the high or low ends, and participants in the network can be machines. Tokens
    thus enable economic activity to expand dramatically to theoretically include
    every human and machine in existence and every tradable resource.

    of tokens, given that the Bitcoin blockchain was the first distributed ledger

    confusion and warrants a brief mention. An ICO purportedly raises funds in an
    open-source environment for a blockchain-based initiative. As part of the ICO,
    a company issues tokens on a blockchain platform and uses smart contracts—lines
    of code that automatically execute the terms of an agreement—to manage the coin
    offering and define the rules. Although currency speculation and scamming have
    been a factor in many ICOs, those launched with genuine intent come with the expectation
    that token holders will get access to the platform or capability under development.
    In this way, the token plays a dual role for the issuer: it represents value,
    since buyers pay for them with fiat currency, and it can create value in the way
    it attracts users to a blockchain solution. We go into more detail on ICOs and
    the decentralization of finance in [chapter 6](../Text/chapter06.html).'

    aim to match the digital benefits of a cryptocurrency, but without the volatility
    that plagues market-traded cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and that deters enterprise
    users wary of risk. Stablecoins try to mitigate volatility by pegging their value
    to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, and holding off-chain a certain amount
    of reserve currency. Issuers of stablecoins must adjust the supply of tokens to
    match the reserve. Fiat-currency-backed stablecoins tend to be centralized, because
    their target monetary variable is centralized. And their use augments one central
    legacy actor (the government or its agent, a central bank) with another—and one
    that may be less stable or less reputable and therefore less credible than a central
    bank. To avoid inherent centralization, a stablecoin might peg its value to a
    portfolio of cryptocurrencies via smart contracts. Another option is to replicate
    the actions of a central bank with an algorithm and smart contract to manage trading
    in a way that decreases volatility.

    are part of blockchain-inspired design, however, they usually serve a limited
    purpose and could consolidate power for the issuer. This limitation diminishes
    the tokens’ effectiveness, because ideally, tokens should not be static; their
    promise lies in their adaptability. A business might issue tokens with one purpose
    in mind and expand that purpose over time as adoption and transaction volumes
    increase. Customer initiatives could drive the expansion, as demonstrated by the
    Q coin example above. Or issuers might design tokens to be used under different

    ownership and consent also provides a way for organizations to comply with privacy
    regulations such as the European Union’s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    For example, in a blockchain, the link from the root information (the personal

    and modes of exchange (the southwest quadrant). These tokens are playing a tactical
    role. More strategic use of tokens is underway now. A token that is both centralized
    in design and programmable will afford the issuer a high degree of control. To
    build adoption, a digital ecosystem might embrace some aspects of decentralization
    in the initial token implementation. The decentralization elements are likely
    to be temporary, however, since the objective is *control* (the northwest quadrant
    of the figure). Once token adoption reaches critical mass—and lock-in—we predict
    that the use of the token in a centralized context will evolve to have more restrictions
    and therefore become more centralized. For example, Uber Pro (the reward program
    for Uber drivers) has some programmability in its tokens but also a high level
    of control by Uber, as only drivers with a satisfaction rating of at least 4.85
    and a low cancellation rate can participate.[^(27)](../Text/notes.html#ch4-en27)

    Instead of a central authority, the design of blockchain gives each participant
    in the network *one equal vote* on whether other participants are authentic and
    transactions are valid, according to the business rules that dictate interactions
    on the blockchain. Participants, can operate as nodes, which are the machines
    owned or used by participants to run a blockchain consensus algorithm each time
    a block of transactions passes through.[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch5-fna) If
    at least 51 percent of the full network nodes conclude that a transaction is good,
    it gets cleared and then appended independently by each node to its copy of the
    ledger.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en3) Duplications, double-counted assets, and
    fraudulent transactions that one node might miss or intentionally overlook are
    unlikely to be missed by the consensus. The one node, one vote, policy is *the
    way* that blockchain gets around the challenge of authentication and validation
    in the absence of a centralized authority.

    nonunity. The consensus that enables decentralization at the technical level usually
    relies on majority rule. If a network introduces a new rule that represents a
    shift in its vision and goals and some nodes disagree about adopting the rule,
    then the network can split, or fork. Forks are created when network members disagree
    on goals and decide to divide into two separate networks (e.g., Bitcoin and Bitcoin
    Cash). Forks may also happen as a response to an emergency, such as when the Ethereum
    community chose to fork because of the failure of the DAO project in 2016.[⁵](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en5)

- en: Decentralization in the Bitcoin blockchain—the largest distributed blockchain
    coordinated through a decentralized architecture—offers a useful view of how a
    network evolves its decentralized architecture over time. Because of the open,
    peer-to-peer nature of blockchain, nodes enter and exit as they choose and the
    technology architecture and the network governance change with those entrances
    and exits. The reward mechanism of Bitcoin, whereby full nodes are compensated
    with bitcoin for the work they do maintaining the network and running the consensus,
    contributes to this trend. Nodes are said to *mine* bitcoin, and the people who
    run nodes are referred to as *miners*. As the ledger grows, miners need more power
    executing at greater speed to run the consensus. With bitcoin, miners with the
    most scalable and cost-efficient operations can mine faster than others. This
    difference results in market consolidation. The decline in the value of bitcoin
    compounds the issue by making the rewards no longer worth the work for less efficient
    miners. They drop out of the mining pool. All this results in the centralization
    of mining; today, four mining pools run more than 50 percent of the Bitcoin network.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch5-en6)

    As we demonstrated in [chapter 4](../Text/chapter04.html), tokenization allows
    participants—whether they are people, organizations, or things—to capture data
    in a tradable form and then share it in whole or in part with counterparties to
    generate new sources of revenue. Combining tokenization with decentralization
    gives participants control over how they share that information and allows the
    value from that exchange to accrue to them. There is no third party to negotiate
    a data exchange without the knowledge of the data owner. In a decentralized environment,
    complementary technologies such as identity and access management tools and confidentiality
    systems like zero-knowledge proofs give participants even tighter reins on the
    information they share, who they share it with and how they share it.[^b](../Text/footnotes.html#ch5-fnb)
    For example, enterprises can guarantee that confidential data has been delivered

    the solution aims to integrate secondary ticket marketplaces and thus more participants
    and market actors with the goal of enabling safer decentralization of the economic

    to data quality. Blockchain is popularly referred to as the *truth machine*, a
    troubling phrase, given that data can be incomplete, inaccurate, biased, context-specific,
    or otherwise misleading. On a digital platform, “truth” is established by amassing
    data over time about what customers look at or buy and then executing on this
    insight. Granted, this data includes quite a few products, and the number is constantly
    growing, but it is still only a part of total customer needs and preferences.
    Who among us hasn’t had the experience of looking at a peripherally interesting
    product on a web platform, only to have ads for that product follow you around
    the internet for weeks? Platforms use this tainted version of truth to nudge customers

    solutions could disrupt the market power of digital platforms while also improving
    trust and allowing widespread opportunity and participation. The consensus algorithm
    enables “truth” in blockchain-complete solutions. The algorithm will reject transactions
    based on what it perceives as inaccurate or unverifiable data, and it allows participants
    to transact, even if they don’t implicitly know or trust their counterparts. Participants
    who don’t follow the blockchain’s rules won’t be authorized to transact. Transactions
    that go against those rules won’t be validated. In addition, record immutability
    allows a participant to access the transaction record to settle any postsettlement
    dispute. Blockchain-inspired solutions don’t necessarily have those safety mechanisms,
    or if they do, they are more costly and cumbersome.

    in the form of fairness, in particular as it applies to fair participation and
    access. Anyone or anything can interact or transact in a blockchain-complete network
    as long as the party adheres to the shared rules of the network. In this way,
    blockchain-complete solutions realize the promise of equal access that was part
    of the World Wide Web at its inception. We are far from that promise today, given
    the power of digital platforms to act as gatekeepers.[⁴](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en4)
    To increase their revenue, platforms must capture as much data as possible and
    limit access competitors may have to the same resources. That capture and control
    creates a motivation to reverse decentralization (see [figure 6-1](#fig6-1)).
    Blockchain solutions, in contrast, expand the range of participants to anyone
    who sees value. Although blockchain does not necessarily produce a green field
    with wide-open participation, it can increase participation and encourage the
    fair distribution of benefits.

    strongly encourages participation. Portable and decentralized identity credentials
    will serve as the standard way that blockchain-complete solutions capture and
    share participant information. In a blockchain-complete environment, these credentials
    are often tokens that capture a user’s relevant information. (The technical approach
    to capturing credentials will change further along the spectrum.) The tokens may
    be stored in a digital wallet. Data owners can then share their tokens for single
    use by designated trading partners. Security clearance is one application for

    with representatives from the Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH), which

    sharing of patient records.[⁶](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en6) TMUH sees the potential
    to give patients control over their “health passport” to improve document protection
    and enable more efficient information sharing. After patients’ consent is captured
    in a smart contract, providers can access reports of medical tests ordered by
    another physician in the hospital and thereby prevent unnecessary duplication
    of tests. Patients can also share their passport with care providers who work
    outside the hospital system. According to the superintendent of the TMUH, Dr.
    Ray-Jade Chen, “the benefits in efficiency alone have been staggering, even for
    the small number of pilot patients on the system. It used to take three weeks
    for a health record exchange; now that same exchange can take place within three
    hours. Likewise, out-of-pocket health-care expenses get reimbursed faster by insurers
    because the necessary exchange of data is more complete and efficient.”[⁷](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en7)

    having a health record that is portable across providers and payers. For businesses,
    a portable license or credential could dramatically decrease the cost of doing
    business. Instead of undergoing separate credentialing processes for each channel
    partner, a business could document the relevant details once, store them in an
    identity token, and share them across networks. Smaller, local, or specialized
    companies could thereby expand their market access. Rather than concentrate their
    digital activity on one platform, businesses and individuals could participate
    across platforms and spread access to their data across them.

    such as moneylenders (some quite legitimate, some functioning as loan sharks)
    and savings groups. In some communities, these informal sources are more common
    than the formal ones. But for large sums of money, budding entrepreneurs with

    banks and, since the 1970s, venture-capital funds, or angel investors.

    of fair access and value exchange. They do this by expanding financial access
    to a larger variety of aspiring entrepreneurs than could or would be served by
    commercial banks, angel investors, or venture-capital funds and by potentially
    accessing a global capital pool. Improved access extends to the supply side as
    well. ICOs allow any investor to support an entrepreneur at almost any level,
    even in increments smaller than $0.01\. Both sides enjoy a fairer exchange of
    value at a fair price within a system that takes a little bit of money from a
    lot of participants. The use of smart contracts as part of the process also facilitates
    a more accurate and auditable transaction flow. All these elements break the hold
    that the formal financial sector has on capital. Decentralized finance thus drives
    down the cost of capital and enables a more equitable exchange—at least in theory.

    is the smart contract. As explained in our discussion of digital currencies, the
    absence of an explicit contract between users and digital platforms has allowed
    the latter to capture and store unlimited amounts of data. The presence of a contract
    would clarify the terms and specify what the participant gets in exchange. The
    idea of smart contracts originated in 1994 with Nick Szabo, a computer scientist
    and cryptographer credited with designing a precursor to bitcoin.[^(16)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en16)

    peer-to-peer transaction. More-complex exchanges involving multiple parties or
    complicated flows of information would instead use a more sophisticated bit of
    technology called a *decentralized application*, or *dapp*. Dapps are applications
    that use smart contracts plus added code to enable the exchange of digital assets
    (tokens) involving back-end computation and front-end access. At the risk of oversimplification,
    a smart contract would be used if a transaction were as straightforward as two
    peers exchanging data tokens. A dapp would be used instead to enable, say, an
    insurance claim that disburses money from an insurance carrier to a claimant and
    that involves the exchange and processing of claim information.

    rules have the additional safeguard in a public blockchain of the consensus mechanism
    to ensure they are followed for each transaction equitably. Although the technology
    capturing those rules is still immature, they will eventually serve the same function
    that centralized oversight does today—as a safeguard. In fact, smart contracts,
    dapps, and consensus can be even more effective, cheaper, and faster than the
    centralized and mediated financial system we have today. But there is a significant
    learning curve before that promise is realized, as demonstrated by the DAO project.

    In May 2016, it raised an impressive $150 million. But the following month, a
    token holder exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract and network code

    space in line for the holder to access a technology solution. But few of the early
    ICOs had an associated contract that required the issuing company to produce a

    and dump campaigns by investors who talk up the coin price and then dump their
    coins on the market, causing a crash in value. Also mixed up with the subject

    creation, investment, and exchange. The successes and failures of ICOs show that
    widespread financial disintermediation can expand access to finance and its delivery.
    ICOs even seem to be lucrative for investors. The aforementioned Boston College
    report found that ICO investors netted an average return of 86 percent; the researchers
    also suggest that fraudulent ICOs, though real, had minimum impact, because investors
    spotted them and underfunded those ICOs.

    plan and effective leadership—decentralized or not—around blockchain. Accessing
    finance isn’t the last of a business’s challenges. The failure of so many organizations
    almost immediately after an ICO suggests that some of these founders were ill
    prepared to run a business. To become sustainable, a blockchain platform or solution
    must still attract customers and serve them at scale.

    advantage of them too, often for funding decentralization initiatives. For these
    organizations, ICOs represent an opportunity to engage existing and prospective
    customers on new initiatives (subject to regulation). When organizations draw
    funds from the user market, they can solidify loyalty and make customers feel
    more invested in the success of a product or service. Token issues executed by
    established organizations are often referred to as *reverse ICOs*.

    With roughly three hundred million registered users, Kik competes with WhatsApp,
    Facebook Messenger, and WeChat using the same ad-driven model. The Canadian company
    had raised significant funds through traditional sources, but in 2017, it decided
    to evolve its solution to a blockchain-complete model that is tokenized and decentralized.
    To that end, Kik held a reverse ICO and sold nearly $100 million in Kin tokens,
    which are also used on the platform to incentivize and reward users when they
    interact with each other. Ted Livingston, Kik’s CEO, said, “Our ultimate vision
    is for Kik to be one of hundreds or thousands of digital services for Kin. What
    if we got all these developers to integrate Kin, then, as a consumer, I can earn
    and spend Kin inside all these places?”[^(23)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en23)

    Because they aim to stabilize the volatility of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins
    indirectly participate in the decentralization of finance while creating still
    another regulatory challenge related to cryptocurrencies. Regulators need to take
    a holistic view of regulating the market. Signs indicate that some regulators
    intend to do just that. In the United States, for example, the Justice Department

    launched in 2017 and has developed a blockchain platform and an MOV token to automate
    payment collections and distribution for films in production. MOV is a utility
    token designed to facilitate cash flow management and financial disbursement.
    In combination with the smart contracts running on the MovieCoin platform, the
    tokens will theoretically facilitate payments and eliminate third-party service
    providers so that the involved contributors (including actors and other creatives,
    who often wait years to see their money) can get paid faster. Consumers could
    even buy MOV tokens and use them to purchase film tickets. A 2018 MOV presale

    to finance sixty films in six years.[^(33)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en33) The MSF
    effectively enables the digitalization and decentralization of film ownership.
    Through it, a new class of accredited investors can own a piece of a film. In
    an interview with *Forbes* magazine, Woodrow said, “One of the key things to consider
    is access. To previously invest in Hollywood films, someone had to show up with
    a check for $50 million dollars to be taken seriously. Utilizing blockchain technology
    can open up an entirely new class to accredited investors who previously couldn’t
    do this.”[^(34)](../Text/notes.html#ch6-en34)

    token and, in 2019, the MSF token, Woodrow imagines that his platform could enable

    combination with decentralization to offer investors new ways to access and trade
    value. This nonprofit blockchain startup created what it calls *blockchain for
    private equity*. The goal is to democratize investing by enabling individual investors
    to buy assets that are usually only available to institutions. Private equity,
    real estate, infrastructure development, and natural resources are all investment
    areas Swarm hopes to open to a larger pool of people. These sectors usually require
    a minimum investment that is out of reach for all but the wealthiest individuals.
    Swarm Fund accesses the sectors by allowing users to buy SWM tokens, which the
    organization combines into an investor swarm capable of buying an institutional-sized
    block. If successful, the Swarm model could not only challenge the dominance of
    major mutual fund and hedge fund companies for a range of consumer investing but
    also disintermediate part of the investment management sector. For example, by
    introducing transparency to the fee and pricing structure of funds and offering
    more-detailed insight into portfolios, the startup could create a more decentralized
    operating model for fund management and could reshuffle the competitive landscape.

    gain acceptance and survive to become standard, even as organizations embrace
    more decentralized models. For example, a consortia of investment bankers could

    with each model serving different levels, sectors, or sensibilities of the financing
    market.

    differently, depending on the archetype of the inspired solutions. Because few
    FOMO solutions will become operational or will survive long, by the time blockchain-complete
    solutions are possible, few if any of this archetype will exist. In contrast,
    opportunistic solutions designed to automate an in-house or industry process will
    still be relevant as long as the process is. For example, solutions like the new
    trading platform that the Australian stock exchange is developing to replace CHESS
    will probably come from the opportunistic archetype (see [chapter 2](../Text/chapter02.html)).
    These solutions will not stay static, however. Opportunistic solutions built by
    consortia or designed to enable cross-organizational use could veer toward centralization
    if they are successful, attract users, and begin to consolidate data relevant
    to the business process. They could, alternatively, become more decentralized
    as the decisions managed by the solution are captured in and executed by a smart
    contract. Blockchain-inspired solutions built to be evolutionary or native will
    have the highest likelihood of staying relevant and coexisting with decentralized
    blockchain solutions, as long as the business models or digital assets they promote
    continue to generate long-term interest.
