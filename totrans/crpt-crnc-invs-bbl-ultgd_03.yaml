- en: To puzzle out the essence of Bitcoin, we need to plunge a little bit into the
    subject of mining. I will tell you about mining as an investment strategy later
    on, but for now let’s consider mining only in terms of the emergence of Bitcoin.

- en: A couple of years ago, many people viewed mining, the producing of cryptocurrency
    or Bitcoins, as a kind of hobby. Many played that game until the famous situation
    with pizza happened. That day is known as the Pizza Day in the cryptocurrency
    community. On May 22, 2010, a developer paid a fellow Bitcoin forum user 10,000
    BTC for two pizzas. Back then, Bitcoin was almost worthless. These two pizzas
    cost the user approximately $25\. Currently (October 2017), one Bitcoin costs
    more than $5,000\. You can easily calculate that those two pizzas cost that guy
    millions of dollars.

    up. First, computing power was used to mine Bitcoin. Later, miners started to
    use graphics cards to form the blocks. Now, they use specialised equipment called
    ASIC. The largest such farms are now located in China.

- en: Mining is the process of producing new cryptocurrency or bitcoins. Let’s sort
    out how the mining works. When, for example, you send money from your wallet to
    another person's wallet, your transactions fall into the so-called "mempool."
    The Bitcoin mempool is a collection of all transactions waiting to receive a network
    confirmation. Miners, guided by their own principles, collect transactions in
    specific blocks and then try to insert them in the Blockchain. Every block in
    the Blockchain generates every ten minutes.

- en: A miner gets a reward for mining a block. Currently, the reward is 12 bitcoins.
    That is, if you introduce a well-formed block into the system, you will get such
    a reward. By the way, the very first (Genesis) block was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.
    Any person could find it and get 50 bitcoins for it. Today, the reward for a properly
    formed block begins to fall. It is said to tumble to an infinitesimal value by
    2140.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One day, miners realized that it was not profitable to mine on a standalone
    basis. The likelihood you will find such a block depends on “hash rate” or how
    powerful your Bitcoin miner's machine is. Under certain acceptable values, if
    say, your hash rate makes up 10% of the total hash rate, you will be able to find
    such blocks with a probability of 10% and get your reward. So, if you mine just
    using your laptop at home, you'll never find a new block. Therefore, in order
    to get a more stable reward, the miners unite in the so-called mining pools. They
    use their united hash rate to reap more regular profits.

- en: 'Now many miners began to think: Why should I mine if I can buy Bitcoin? It
    is also a good idea as the value of Bitcoin is determined only by the belief of
    those people who use it, while its cost is determined by demand. If no one buys
    your Bitcoin from you, it will cost nothing. Therefore, as long as people see
    this technology as an opportunity to use it anonymously, make large payments,
    and so on, the value of Bitcoin will gain momentum.'

    book, [Mastering Bitcoin for Starters](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Starters-Cryptocurrency-Technologies-ebook/dp/B0741T771J/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1509101839&sr=1-5&keywords=bitcoin),
    to this topic. For now, I will consider the advantages of Bitcoin, which still
    raise some questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first advantage is low transaction costs. However, we should bear in mind
    that Bitcoin is not good enough for micropayments. If you transfer someone $1
    million, it will cost you a penny. However, if you decide to pay for a cup of
    coffee, the fees will be large compared to the cost of your coffee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second advantage is high-speed transaction processing. Here are also some
    hitches. In fact, every block in the Blockchain generates every ten minutes, i.e.
    the fastest possible transaction takes ten minutes. It seems this is rather quick
    if compared to the SWIFT transfer in a bank, which can take 2-4 days. However,
    Visa and MasterCard are much faster. They can process tens of thousands of times
    more transactions per unit of time than Bitcoin. It is worth noting that some
    other types of cryptocurrency now exist which were developed to be faster than
    Bitcoin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third advantage is the pseudo-anonymity of participants. We have already
    studied that anyone can track all transactions on the network. If you know the
    exact owner of a wallet, you can track absolutely all transactions carried out
    from it. Thus it cannot be said that Bitcoin is absolutely anonymous. As soon
    as one manages to match your address with your personality, anonymity disappears.
    But if you observe so-called "internet hygiene," meaning you do not show your
    wallet to anyone, then basically your transactions cannot be tracked. I should
    mention, though, there are other cryptocurrencies which are more anonymous than
    Bitcoin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the way, if you want to stay anonymous when making transactions on the Bitcoin
    network, this is already possible. There are many services that wash your bitcoins.
    They are called "mixing services" and are used to mix one's funds with other people's
    bitcoins, intending to confuse the trail back to the funds' original source. As
    you see, new technologies have appeared to step up the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.

- en: 'And, finally, now more than 16 million bitcoins circulate in the world, while
    a total of 21 million will be mined. Such figures are programmed by the algorithm
    of the network itself. The limited amount of Bitcoin makes inflation of this currency
    impossible. This currency does not depreciate over time because only a certain
    amount will be issued. Bitcoin even has a deflationary model: many people lose
    their coins by forgetting the password for the wallet or sending money to the
    wrong address. Therefore, the number of bitcoins will gradually decrease.'

    that the transactions are really truthful; how to make sure that a miner does
    not deceive anyone; what should be done to choose the right block and actually
    build the Blockchain. All these issues are settled via the consensus algorithm.'

- en: The Proof of Work protocol confirms that a miner does a huge amount of work
    to find a correct nonce and get a successful hash. You should spend much time
    to find the needed one. I'll explain in more detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The block difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks and depends on how many zeros
    are at the beginning of a particular hash. It is not difficult to find the hash
    itself, but it takes pains to find a successful hash with a certain number of
    zeros. If you have the hash of a previous block as well as timestamp and transaction
    data, it seems that it is very easy to make a new hash from this and process this
    block. However, you need to find a nonce, whose value is set so that the hash of
    the block will contain a run of leading zeros. Much time is needed for that. Once
    miners find this successful hash, they send a block to the Blockchain. That is,
    they have already confirmed all transactions, having done some work. So, there
    is no point in deceiving someone as such work is very difficult to do.

- en: After that, all information is distributed in the nodes. First, a miner sends
    one node. It can run a check on whether, for example, those people who sent money
    from point A to point B really had that money, i.e. whether all the transactions
    are valid. Then the nodes start to exchange this information with each other,
    and thus, the block is formed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In theory, it could happen that two miners create one and the same block. How
    will Blockchain choose which block is better? The first principle is speed. The
    second principle is "success" of a hash. Therefore, "success" of a hash is exactly
    the efforts which the miners should make within the Proof of Work protocol.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason why you need to choose a "successful" hash is an adjustment of
    the network difficulty. The more miners appear, the more network difficulty grows,
    which means that transactions can be processed more quickly. If the miners slow
    down in finding the blocks, the difficulty goes down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me add a few more words about how to settle the situation when several miners
    create identical blocks on the network. The essence of the Blockchain consensus
    is that the longest chain of blocks is considered to be fair. If the blocks begin
    to be built in a direction different from yours, then your first block will again
    fall into the pool of unconfirmed transactions. This often happens when the network
    is overloaded. So to make sure that the next blocks are built exactly under your
    block and you will get the reward, wait until several more blocks are formed after
    yours. If more than five blocks are formed, the money is definitely yours.

    it's time to talk about the cons of Blockchain, namely the 51% attack or double-spending.
    I will explain.

- en: Any mining pool can unite its efforts to such an extent that the probability
    of generating the next block in this pool can be 51%. The cryptocurrency community
    once witnessed the situation when the members of the Chinese mining pool artificially
    restricted new members in their system and managed to generate about six blocks
    in a row. It was after this incident that it became clear you have to wait for
    the confirmation of transaction for one hour, not for ten minutes. That is if
    you create five blocks, and each of them is formed for ten minutes, we multiply
    by five and get 50 minutes.
