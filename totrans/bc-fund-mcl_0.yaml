    helpful and instructive book *Blockchain Foundations for the Internet of Value*
    is a timely one. The COVID-19 pandemic will profoundly change our behavior and
    society. Many institutions will come under scrutiny and, we hope, change for the
    better.

    change. Technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, augmented/virtual
    reality, and above all, blockchain, are more relevant than ever—not just to business
    and the economy but to the future of public health and the safety of global populations.
    Traditional systems have failed us and it’s time for a new paradigm. To build
    on Victor Hugo, *“Nothing is more powerful than an idea that has become a necessity.”*
    To avoid and manage pandemics the world needs the Internet of Value. It’s time
    for a new paradigm.

- en: In Blockchain Revolution, Alex Tapscott and l argued this Internet of Value
    represents a second era of the Internet. The first era was defined by information—the
    Internet of Information, a peer-to-peer mechanism for communicating information
    and collaborating online. While it has enabled companies to interact directly
    with consumers, take orders online, and deliver digital goods, services, and experiences,
    it has not fundamentally changed how we do business. Companies and markets are
    still vertically or horizontally integrated hierarchies, relatively opaque and
    insular, and relatively slow to change. We can say the same of public institutions.

    to exchange things of value. Governments, banks, digital platforms such as Amazon,
    eBay, and AirBnB, and universities do the work of establishing our identity, vouching
    for our trustworthiness, and helping us to acquire and transfer assets and settle
    the transactions.

    servers, which can be hacked. They take a piece of the value for performing this
    service—say 10 percent to send some money internationally. They capture our data,
    not just preventing us from using it for our own benefit but often undermining
    our privacy. These intermediaries are sometimes unreliable and often slow. They
    exclude two billion people who don’t have enough money to justify a bank account,
    let alone an education. Most problematic, they are capturing the benefits of the
    digital age asymmetrically.

- en: 'We posed the question: *“What if there was an Internet of value—a global, distributed,
    highly secure platform, ledger, or database where we could store and exchange
    things of value and trust each other without powerful intermediaries?”* That is
    the blockchain. Collective self-interest, hard-coded into this new native digital
    medium for value, would ensure the safety, security, and reliability of our exchanges
    online. Trust is programmed into the technology, which is why we call blockchain
    the Trust Protocol.'

- en: Combine AI and Machine Learning with blockchain and this represents the second
    era of the digital age. Every institution will change profoundly. How about the
    corporation, a pillar of modern capitalism? With the rise of a global peer-to-peer
    platform for identity, trust, reputation and transactions, we will be able to
    re-engineer deep structures of the firm, for innovation and shared value creation.
    We’re talking about building 21st century companies that look more like networks
    rather than the vertically integrated hierarchies of the industrial age. The whole
    financial service industry is already being reinvented by blockchain and others
    will soon follow. How well does today’s university prepare students for such a
    future?

    smart things in the physical world will be sensing; responding; communicating;
    sharing important data; generating, buying and selling their own electricity;
    and doing everything from protecting our environment to managing our health. It
    turns out, this Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything.

    prosperity paradox. The economy is growing but fewer people are benefiting. Rather
    than trying to solve the problem of growing social inequality through redistribution
    alone, we can change how wealth—and opportunity—is predistributed in the first
    place, as people everywhere, from farmers to musicians, can use this technology
    to share more fully in the wealth they create.

    Research Institute convened a virtual roundtable of 30 experts from five continents.
    We discussed the challenges of COVID-19 and the possibilities of using blockchain
    in areas of need. In our special report, *Blockchain Solutions in Pandemics*,
    we developed a framework for facing pandemics together in these five areas.

    now, it sits in institutional silos. We need better access to the data of entire
    populations and a speedy consent-based data sharing system. To accelerate discovery,
    the blockchain start-up, Shivom, is working on a global project to collect and
    share virus host data in response to a call for action from the European Union’s
    Innovative Medicines Initiative. In Honduras, Civitas—an app developed by the
    start-up Emerge—is linking Hondurans' government-issued ID numbers with blockchain
    records used to track medical appointments. Doctors simply scan the app to review
    a patient's symptoms verified and recorded by telemedicine services. And Dr. Raphael
    Yahalom of MIT and Oxford-Hainan Research Institute is working on Trustup, a trust-reasoning
    framework that can systematically highlight the ways in which health data recorded
    on a blockchain ledger is more trustworthy than data stored in conventional databases.
    The trade-off between privacy and public safety need not be so stark. Through
    self-sovereign identities where individuals own their health records and can freely
    volunteer it to researchers, we can achieve both.

    is doing just that for the pharmaceutical supply industry. One of its co-founders,
    Dr. Philip Baker, was interested in tracking down and recycling unused but still
    efficacious medications, such as those used for cancer. He saw blockchain as means

    VeriTX—a virtual marketplace for digital assets like patented design files—pivoted
    to medical supplies, so that medical facilities could print the parts needed at
    one of the 180 3D printing facilities in VeriTX’s network.**^(([i](#rfn_i)))**
    VeriTX can reverse-engineer a part and then build it much faster and at a lower
    cost than getting it from the original manufacturer or replacing the equipment.

    Yet, money as a carrier of the disease has been a stressor during this pandemic.
    We highlight the what, why, and how of digital cash as an alternative. Costs are
    also an issue. The Ethereum-based Solve.Care platform is dramatically lowering
    healthcare administrative costs so that more of a patient’s medical budget goes
    directly to care. The health crisis has also become a financial crisis, closing
    off access to supply chain credit. We look at blockchain-based financing solutions
    such as Chained Finance and fundraising efforts like that of the Binance Charity
    Foundation. Finally, decentralized models of governance such as those created
    by blockchain start-ups Abridged and Aragon can transform how NGOs, governments,
    and communities respond to the crisis.

    Yet hospitals can’t onboard people fast enough. This is not for lack of talent;
    it’s the inability to find those with proper credentials. Blockchain platforms
    such as Dock.io, ProCredEx, and Zinc.work help to streamline coordination among
    different geographies, departments, and certification bodies so that supply and
    demand for healthcare workers—as well as the process for verifying their skills—becomes

    many can be implemented quickly. Governments must wake up to the blockchain opportunity.
    Every national government should create an emergency task force on medical data
    to start planning and implementing blockchain initiatives. They can stimulate
    the development of technology firms working on the solutions described here. They
    should partner with medical professional associations and other players to implement
    blockchain credential systems.

    companies could consider embedding incentive systems for socially responsible

    to this mix the exponential properties of blockchain, and we’re setting ourselves

    If there was ever a topic that needed de-obfuscation, blockchain is one. The book
    clearly explains key blockchain concepts and the global blockchain landscape.
    It’s not a book about crypto or digital currencies, but rather one that will be
    of considerable help to strategists, and implementors within enterprises and government,
    laying out a solid framework for applications and outlining a plethora of great
    use cases in the financial services industry, supply chains, and credentials for
    talent. It’s also a practical book with real down-to-earth approaches and even
    tactics on how to make it happen in your organization.
