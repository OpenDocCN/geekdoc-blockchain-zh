  zh: 9.1. 引言
- en: The good management of global business activities has become more challenging
    as society advances in its understanding of the impact of our activities on each
    other and on our planet. Business activities that a generation ago were unfettered,
    undocumented or unregulated are now becoming better understood, scrutinized, documented
    and regulated, and the consequences of undesirable activities are now much more
    visible. The term “responsible sourcing” has been used to describe the desire
    to assure sourcing that doesn’t compromise human values (such as using child labor
    or forced labor), harm society (such as supporting illegal or criminal activity,
    or forcing land resettlement) or negatively impact the environment (such as causing
    deforestation or chemical pollution).

    supply chains in order to be able to assure responsible sourcing, however that
    knowledge can be hampered by a need to protect business confidentiality, by a
    lack of knowledge of the participants more than one transaction removed from the
    company, and until recently by a lack of concern with events outside the walls
    of the company. A recent increase in regulatory request, consumer interest and
    potential legal liability have moved enterprises to expand the role of product
    sourcing beyond a simple interaction with their immediate suppliers. A company’s
    procurement service that once would have been limited to such immediate needs
    as identifying reliable suppliers, evaluating product quality and ensuring timely
    delivery, now needs to seek assistance from other departments within the company
    to manage new purchasing subjects such as ensuring regulatory compliance, understanding
    and avoiding harmful business risk, and even previously unimagined challenges
    such as avoiding participation in illegal activity, money laundering and human
    slavery – in other words, in providing due diligence; due diligence being the
    care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their
    property.

    people depend on artisanal mining. About seven million people are employed in
    large-scale industrial mining (LSM) worldwide. Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining
    (ASM) occurs in approximately 80 countries. ASM production supply accounts for
    20% of mined gold. A typical ASM mining process includes digging the gold ore,
    transporting the ore (carried in bags or by wheelbarrow) to where it is manually
    crushed, washed and filtered. The filtered sediment is processed chemically to
    yield an amalgam that is then sold to local traders. LSM extraction of gold typically
    involves machine crushing and milling the rock to a powder or slurry, then vat
    or heap leaching using sodium cyanide to yield impure gold.
