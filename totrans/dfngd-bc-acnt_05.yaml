- en: The good management of global business activities has become more challenging
    as society advances in its understanding of the impact of our activities on each
    other and on our planet. Business activities that a generation ago were unfettered,
    undocumented or unregulated are now becoming better understood, scrutinized, documented
    and regulated, and the consequences of undesirable activities are now much more
    visible. The term “responsible sourcing” has been used to describe the desire
    to assure sourcing that doesn’t compromise human values (such as using child labor
    or forced labor), harm society (such as supporting illegal or criminal activity,
    or forcing land resettlement) or negatively impact the environment (such as causing
    deforestation or chemical pollution).

    supply chains in order to be able to assure responsible sourcing, however that
    knowledge can be hampered by a need to protect business confidentiality, by a
    lack of knowledge of the participants more than one transaction removed from the
    company, and until recently by a lack of concern with events outside the walls
    of the company. A recent increase in regulatory request, consumer interest and
    potential legal liability have moved enterprises to expand the role of product
    sourcing beyond a simple interaction with their immediate suppliers. A company’s
    procurement service that once would have been limited to such immediate needs
    as identifying reliable suppliers, evaluating product quality and ensuring timely
    delivery, now needs to seek assistance from other departments within the company
    to manage new purchasing subjects such as ensuring regulatory compliance, understanding
    and avoiding harmful business risk, and even previously unimagined challenges
    such as avoiding participation in illegal activity, money laundering and human
    slavery – in other words, in providing due diligence; due diligence being the
    care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their
    property.

    in different countries; thousands of traders of finished raw material; thousands
    of component manufacturers; tens of thousands of manufacturers of the finished
    product; and hundreds of thousands of different finished products to be sold to

    where the gold is located. Each country regulates the ability to mine and ownership
    of mines, as well as the human, environmental, safety and political conditions
    under which mining can occur. Countries may cooperate with international regulation
    and guidance or may govern independently. Countries, just like individuals, can
    be responsible or corrupt, laissez-faire or interventionist, nationalistic or
    global in their behaviors, and this variability means that some countries are
    much less effective than others in assuring responsible activities in the gold
    supply chain. Countries also vary in their permission or prohibition of artisanal
    mining, individual land ownership, and mining rights.

    people depend on artisanal mining. About seven million people are employed in
    large-scale industrial mining (LSM) worldwide. Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining
    (ASM) occurs in approximately 80 countries. ASM production supply accounts for
    20% of mined gold. A typical ASM mining process includes digging the gold ore,
    transporting the ore (carried in bags or by wheelbarrow) to where it is manually
    crushed, washed and filtered. The filtered sediment is processed chemically to
    yield an amalgam that is then sold to local traders. LSM extraction of gold typically
    involves machine crushing and milling the rock to a powder or slurry, then vat
    or heap leaching using sodium cyanide to yield impure gold.

    include mine supervisors, local tribal authority, government officials, police
    and others, each of whom can perform their work legally or illegally.

    receive not only mineral ore from LSM and ASM but also recycled material coming
    from a variety of sources. In a smelter, gold is released from its natural mineral
    state by melting and then reacting with chemicals. The resulting doré gold is
    a semi-pure alloy of gold and silver that can vary in purity, so it is subsequently
    then transported to refineries, where further treatment can bring the purity of
    the gold to nearly 100%.

    and signed off on by multiple parties at multiple points in the supply chain.
    Some data, such as shipment amounts and numbers, grade and location might be collected
    automatically from enterprise management software or internet of things devices
    in the production facilities. Automation makes it more difficult to fake data
    increasing trust.

    based on the practices they employ, like a social reputation score. Companies
    who know their suppliers, tag and track their shipments, have good relationships
    to civil society, are transparent about worker wages, and send and receive all
    payments electronically might get a higher social reputation score than companies
    with fewer such practices. If customers prefer suppliers with a higher social
    reputation score, it could act as an incentive for companies to improve their
    practices and invest in data collection and tracking.

    reported and these reports attached to our tokens. We need to identify a group
    that is in a position to witness the incident, identify how to make reporting
    easy, identify incentives that would encourage them to make the report, and then
    identify how to prevent false reports.

- en: Incidents of child labor are difficult to identify. A mine may put children
    in school on the day of inspection and then revert when the inspectors leave.
    First let’s identify a group that can witness these incidents. We know incidents
    like this happen because inspectors are not the only group of workers who visit
    mine sites. Often mining engineers, geologists or other workers will visit these
    sites and see incidents that they cannot act on. This is our identified group
    that is in a position to witness the incidents. Now, how can we make reporting
    easy for this group? Mining engineers and geologists are often well-paid and have
    access to technology. Perhaps a simple reporting app on a smart phone would suffice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, how can we then incentivize them to make a report? Engineers and geologists
    have a code of ethics. Knowing that a report would make a difference might be
    enough to encourage them to participate. Perhaps we could take funds and give
    them to an NGO that works to end child labor with each report. On the other side
    they might be concerned for their safety as a whistleblower, so having a certain
    level of anonymity might also be important to encourage participation. Perhaps
    only the NGO would have access to the identity of who made the report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, how can we prevent false reports? We could try collecting some automated
    metadata such as date and time of a visit, or we could reduce the impact of individual
    reports so that a single report won’t be as damaging to a company. Perhaps the
    reports don’t automatically get assigned to shipments from the mine in question
    until the NGO is able to confirm them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An implementation of the above may proceed as follows. We need to start with
    money. We identify a company sending miners and geologists to mine sites. These
    mine sites are all tracked on our token-based traceability system we outlined
    above. The company locks $20,000 in a smart contract. Once the money is locked
    in, the company’s engineers and geologists are able to use a simple reporting
    app to make a report whenever they visit a production site. Limiting reporting
    to people appointed by the company contributing the money is one way to reduce
    the incidence of false reports.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The report should be very simple, either stating the worker saw an incident
    of child labor, or that they did not. Either way, submitting the report transfers
    $10 from the smart contract to a non-profit tasked with following up on these
    incidents to clean up the supply chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The company locking in the money, as well as the engineers and geologists will
    be able to see an aggregation of how many reports have been made at that mine
    site, with anonymous data. After a certain number of incidents are reported, the
    NGO makes a surprise visit to the mine to verify the reports. If child labor is
    seen, the NGO adds a red flag on the blockchain to all shipments coming from the
    site.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With our above proposal you may have noticed a heavy use of uncertain words
    such as “perhaps” and “try.” Incident reporting is not a solved problem. Incidents
    happen because of complex dynamics with a lot of moving parts, including the individual
    motivations of workers, local culture and attitudes which may vary from region
    to region, economic stability in the region, and people in the position to report
    incidents being afraid of repercussions for doing so. Implementing a blockchain-powered
    system to address incident reporting may have a mix of positive outcomes and unintended
    consequences that are very difficult to predict and at this point we should expect
    solutions to be experimental.

    to make it so that the winners are everyone who wants to participate in a responsible
    mineral supply chain, and the losers are armed groups sourcing using illicit practices.

    of the mining supply chain, and with this shift has come the need for a safer,
    more transparent, accurate and detailed, reliable and cost-effective means to
    assure provenance. Blockchain technology can and will provide that solution.
