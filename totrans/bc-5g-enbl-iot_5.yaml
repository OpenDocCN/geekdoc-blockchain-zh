    and information solutions to make the life of people better and easier [[1](#CR1)–[3](#CR3)].
    Nowadays IoT provides many advantages of using its applications. In healthcare,
    many technologies and solutions can improve the available solutions such as wearables.
    In healthcare applications, finding out a suitable solutions based on different
    factors such as the time interval (latency), battery life, dynamic range, throughput,
    adaptability, coverage, and organizational model [[4](#CR4), [5](#CR5)] is a challenging
    issue. There are a lot of applications and health status for remote monitoring
    available in homes, hospital rooms, and wearable invasive or noninvasive devices
    which a combination of the short- and long-range communication technologies is
    necessary [[6](#CR6)–[9](#CR9)]. Figure [20.1](#Fig1) shows how healthcare devices
    get the streaming data through inputs from wearable devices and then send the
    same to the cloud to be analyzed by healthcare services to visualize its overall
    impact.![../images/501059_1_En_20_Chapter/501059_1_En_20_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_20_Chapter/501059_1_En_20_Fig1_HTML.png)

    the patients with a new choice to contact their healthcare providers to give them
    needed care online. These solutions can reduce the time and financial resources
    allocated at hospitals for senior care and for other patients as well. This technology
    allows caregivers to help the patients and show them their physical parameters
    such as blood pressure, oxygen rate, blood pressure, etc. [[8](#CR8)]. Most of
    the available wearables provide a Bluetooth connection with smartphones using
    iOS or Android and cloud services for edge computing for processing, storage,

- en: Satoshi Nakamoto conceived electronic cash system because of the financial slowdown
    in the year 2008 as an alternative to physical currency. The blockchain technology
    was designed to introduce electronic currency or crypto-currency system called
    Bitcoin. The objective was to create a secure and decentralized digital currency
    that can be used as a medium of exchange of currency across the globe. Authors
    discovered that the unique features of blockchain such as immutable, decentralized,
    peer-to-peer, open ledger system have shown considerable influence on every industry
    in the recent decade. The source code of Bitcoin was released as an open-source,
    leveraging developers and researchers to use this code for developing diverse
    applications. Researchers began to realize the potential of blockchain and started
    exploring this blockchain technology applications in other industries also. Blockchain
    is the underlying technology for the revolutionary crypto-currency and Bitcoin
    systems [[1](#CR1)].

- en: The history and the applications of Bitcoin using blockchain concept are presented.
    Authors explained the working principles of Bitcoin and legal issues involved
    in Bitcoin transactions. The real-time applications and challenges in implementing
    Bitcoin are also covered [[2](#CR2)]. The blockchain technology ensures trust
    in processing transactions by implementing smart contracts, consensus mechanism
    and avoids the third-party centralized controls. The reduced complexity in solving
    proof of work (PoW) puzzle also optimizes blockchain platform performance. Decentralization
    and group trust reduces the cost of transaction processing in Bitcoin-based solutions.
    The successful implementation of blockchain in the crypto-currency domain has
    inspired its extended applications in other domains such as healthcare, banking,
    industry, etc. The implementation of blockchain technology in IIoT systems also
    enhances security mechanism [[3](#CR3)].

- en: An ICT architecture based on blockchain technology for efficient project management
    was designed. This architecture facilitates the project team to carry out all
    project-related financial transactions in real time securely. The project execution
    consists of three types of transactions related to reimbursement of bills, profits
    and cost saving; these bills are processed using smart contracts. Authors have
    discussed the proof of concept and implementation of Hyperledger network using
    IBM® Blockchain Cloud Beta platform. This architecture applies smart contracts
    for efficient financial management and its automation. Security and privacy are
    ensured using Hyperledger Fabric in this blockchain architecture [[5](#CR5)].
    A global crowd-funding platform called BitFund provides an optimum project cost
    allocation. Investors and developers are represented as the nodes of a blockchain.
    The capitalists would publish the requirements for a specific project or concept
    by quoting their first bid price. This first bid price includes the cost of development,
    maintenance and time duration available for the project. The development team
    analyses the merits and demerits to claim the project implementation responsibility
    and bids for the project. The investors and developers will have several rounds
    of discussions to reach a consensus on project implementation. The developers
    and investors would negotiate and sign a smart contract by expressing their consent
    on project terms and conditions. The BitFund platform revealed better performance
    when compared to other similar platforms. This platform would enhance investor’s
    profits and the developer’s project execution prospects [[6](#CR6)].

    applications such as financial budget management, environment. Monitoring government,
    dwelling and mobility planning. Energy generation and management is a significant
    factor for a smart city to be self-sustainable. The inexhaustible sources of power
    such as solar and wind energies are to be best exploited in a smart city. Smart
    contracts with consumers would facilitate only the necessary power to be transmitted
    to consumer devices based on their current power needs. Smart contracts ensure
    automated and dynamic management of power supply and pricing policies. Smart contracts
    also leverage consumers to select the best services offers provided by different
    power supply companies leading to healthy competition in the energy market. This
    innovative power distribution system works on the concept of just in time power
    or power on demand to the consumer devices. Sharp contracts leverage robust, online
    financial and operational data recording of power delivered to the consumer. Blockchain
    implementation proposes a new concept called essential-ness business, promoting
    optimum balance in peer-to-peer (P2P) controlled trading. Small-scale distributed
    energy resource (DER) suppliers can sell their excess power to the energy grid.

    This control centre transmits energy and the operating instructions to smart homes.
    The two-way communication between the smart home and power control centre makes

    with a credit-differentiated edge transaction acceptance technique. The outcomes

    Fabric called attribute-based access control (ABAC). This framework supports three
    types of contracts; they are access contract (AC), device contract (DC) and policy
    contract (PC). DC saves the URL of data resources captured by IoT devices and
    facilitates inquiry processing. Administrative users can manipulate ABAC through
    PC. Normal users enforce access control through AC. IoT systems are empowered
    with dynamic access control management and a decentralized, fine-grained platform
    for the implementation of Fabric IoT. Authors have simulated two sets of experiments.
    Their outcome revealed that Fabric IoT provides high output per unit time and

    to enable flexibility for radio access (RA) mobile nodes [[41](#CR41)]. The customers

    and the quality of the connection between the devices have been improved significantly.
    A network may consist of many drones, users and IoT devices where an autonomous
    operation is possible by moving 5G radio access networks (RAN) with ML [[42](#CR42)].
    Understanding the impact of RAN technology on the transport layer of the networks
    is essential for designing the interfaces in the future. Authors evaluated the
    5G scenario-based variations of consumer traffic and the extent of utilization
    of 4G features in real life to meet the targeted performance. Computed 5G transport
    network data rate requirements considering per-cell and cumulative cases into
    account. The statistical multiplexing is an important function in reducing the
    cost and capacity of 5G networks. The procedure for designing a 5G transport network
    was discussed. Authors introduced new functional modules to prevent additional
    costs for increasing the transport capacity as demanded by mmWave and massive
    MIMO technologies [[43](#CR43)]. An investigation on the spectrum utilization
    efficiency (SUE) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) for assessing the availability
    of channels and the probability of completion of service was carried out. Spectrum-efficient
    CRN (SE-CRN) applies a hybrid underlay-interweave (UI) mode of CRNs to secondary
    users for collaborative communication. Two types of spectrum utilization with
    high and low levels of priority are taken into account. Multiple attribute-based
    methods for service discovery for low-priority users’ interruption were proposed
    to ensure the optimum channel accessibility for high-priority users. The outcome
    derived from this scheme assured significant enhancement in channel accessibility,
    reduction in no service probability and service retainability [[44](#CR44)].

- en: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones are extensively used in defence as
    well as civilian applications today because of its cost-effective and efficient
    operations. The drones are controlled from the control room or moving access points
    in the sky. The drones can also be connected to the Internet forming a new paradigm
    called the Internet of Drones (IoD) [[55](#CR55)]. Ensuring privacy and security
    to these Internet of Drones (IoD) on the fly is very difficult and must be handled
    efficiently. Applying blockchain technologies would be promising in this context
    due to its unique advantages such as decentralization, immutability and traceability
    of transactions. The capability to prevent any possible attacks is very essential
    in the IoD environment. The implementation of this scheme revealed enhanced security,
    more functional capabilities and less communication and computation costs when
    compared to other similar Schemes [[64](#CR64)].

- en: This paper proposed one-way permutation function to reduce the storage on the
    client side of systems. Authors concentrated on improving the performance of forwarding
    secure searchable encryption schemes. The state-of-the-art forward private SSE
    scheme is proposed in CCS 2016 which relies on the asymmetric cryptographic primitive
    [[66](#CR66)]. Authors discussed a method to derive the keys and applied it to
    plain text blocks to generate the cypher text using keys. The reverse procedure
    needs to be applied at the receiving end to retrieve the plain text from the cypher
    text. The application of AES technique has enhanced the randomness in inputs.
    The security is provided by MAC using irreversible process. CBC concept of blockchain
    is applied in this method. This method has minimum complexity in architecture
    and reduces time complexity and vulnerabilities. The analysis of this method ensured
    the randomness in generated keys [[67](#CR67)]. Authors highlighted the unique
    advantages of blockchain and introduced blockchain-enhanced pub/sub communication
    model (BPS). BPS is decentralized for multi-tenant edge cloud, to rebuild pub/sub
    system internal security methods. BPS exploits blockchain technology to detect
    prohibited operations and actions from both vindictive tenants and unreliable
    publishers or subscribers. BPS applies Merkle hash tree (MHT) directly to verify
    the integrity of vital and private meta-data. BPS presents smart contract-based
    micro-level control on content-based classified messages by saving access control
    list. BPS also adopts an incentive method for sincere publishers and subscribers.
    Authors have implemented the BPS model on Kafka and EoS blockchain. The rigorous
    analysis and experiments conducted revealed that BPS performs better with minimum
    cost compared to other models [[68](#CR68)].

- en: The integration of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) helps to strengthen
    and leverage mutual advantages in a variety of industrial domains including healthcare.
    The healthcare industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries involving
    more than 10% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of several countries globally.
    The use of blockchain in IoT can help to track multiple devices in the network,
    avoid duplication of malicious data entries, disallow data tampering, and provide
    enhanced security and privacy. Several devices are connected in an IoT network
    for fast-paced 5G-enabled data transfer environment for different industrial applications
    for collecting information and processing it, and the chances of failure of this
    centralized system are much higher. The time required to retrieve data from different
    devices, existing protocols, and access control mechanism employed presently may
    not work in the future as they are centralized based mechanisms [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)].
    The deployment of blockchain in IoT allows distributed, decentralized ledger records
    with high security, privacy, improved efficiency, and authenticity of data [[1](#CR1),
    [3](#CR3), [4](#CR4)].

    [2](#CR2)]。在IoT中部署区块链允许具有高安全性、隐私性、改进的效率和数据的真实性的分布式、去中心化的分类帐记录[[1](#CR1), [3](#CR3),

    intermediary [[5](#CR5)]. The blockchain technology is growing rapidly with promising
    applications in several technological fields. It is a decentralized system where
    the data entries are immutable and cannot be altered at convenience. The time-stamped
    chain of blocks are connected in a blockchain framework using cryptographic hashes
    affecting all industrial domains exponentially even influencing the healthcare
    sectors through its processes, services, management, education, etc. The blockchain
    has largely affected the functioning of electronic and personal health records
    (EHR and PHR) in the healthcare set-up. Cocosila et al. [[17](#CR17)] and Lafourcade
    et al. [[44](#CR44)] cited that the blockchain allows better data integrity in
    all aspects, access control to medical records, interoperability, and smooth transactions.
    The term blockchain originated from “Bitcoin” or cryptocurrency in the year 2008\.

- en: A blockchain comprises a sequential chain of blocks which contains all transaction
    records. The first block is the genesis block, with successive blocks connected
    through hash values. Das et al. [[31](#CR31)] affirmed that the blockchain concept
    was first introduced as an integral component of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The
    paper that led to the creation of Bitcoin was published in 2008, and the first
    genesis block of the blockchain was mined on 3 January 2009\. The blockchain system
    comprises the decentralized database with open access, transparency, and autonomy
    to all users who are logged into the network to access information and regularly
    update post approval. Once the records are updated in the blockchain network,
    it cannot be deleted or removed easily without authentication and approval from
    more than half (51%) the number of users on the network. Hasselgren et al. [[18](#CR18)]
    stated that blockchain would help to overcome several problems associated with
    the complex integrated healthcare network including the lack of traceability during
    different transactions, non-reporting of clinical trials, and issues related to
    sub-standard or fake medicines being regularly supplied to patients. This would
    avoid the lack of confidentiality in handling the patient data and non-sharing
    with for-profit organizations for commercial benefits or misuse of the information
    in any form. It would also remove the presence of middleman in the healthcare
    system by cutting down on costs, thereby enhancing trust and transparency in the
    system. Drosatos et al. [[20](#CR20)] referred that it would reduce dependency
    on single supplier for procuring resources for the healthcare systems, thereby
    allowing them to contact different vendors as per requirement without incurring
    substantial costs or legal constraints. Presently, these blockchain systems are
    at the proof ofconcept stage; however, their potential is being acknowledged and

    导致比特币创建的论文于2008年发表，区块链的第一个创世块于2009年1月3日开采。 区块链系统包括具有开放访问、透明度和自主性的分散式数据库，所有登录到网络的用户都可以访问信息并定期在批准后更新。
    一旦记录在区块链网络中更新，就不能轻易删除或移除，而不经过网络上超过半数（51%）用户的认证和批准。 Hasselgren等人[[18](#CR18)]指出，区块链将有助于克服与复杂集成的医疗保健网络相关的几个问题，包括不同交易期间的可追溯性缺乏、临床试验的未报告以及定期向患者供应次标准或假药品的问题。
    这将避免处理患者数据时的缺乏机密性，并且不会与营利组织共享数据以获取商业利益或以任何形式滥用信息。 它还将通过削减成本来削减医疗保健系统中的中间人的存在，从而提高系统的信任和透明度。
    Drosatos等人[[20](#CR20)]指出，这将减少医疗保健系统为获取资源而依赖单一供应商的程度，从而使他们能够根据需要与不同的供应商联系，而不会产生重大成本或法律限制。
    目前，这些区块链系统处于概念验证阶段； 但是，人们正在认识到它们的潜力，并且涉及区块链技术的几个项目正在迅速增加[[20](#CR20)，[21](#CR21)]。

    controlling the addition of blockchain content. The immutable entries are added
    to the blockchain network based on consensus through peer-to-peer network. Balandina

    protocols which are self-executable smart contracts. Persistence is also a key
    feature of blockchain as accepted entries cannot be deleted due to a distributed
    ledger stored across multiple nodes. It allows anonymity in the blockchain set-up
    with easy traceability due to interconnectivity of different blocks with each
    other through the hash. The transactions are arranged in the form of a Merkle
    tree for each block with each leaf value verified to its established root for
    traceability. Previously, the blockchain was used extensively in the finance sector
    as it allows security and privacy of data; however, nowadays, it is being applied
    in several computational fields where voluminous transactions take place. Kumar

    The record of previous block and transactions is available with each block, thereby
    making it a secure and immutable ledger record. The chain increases as new blocks
    are added and arranged in a peer-to-peer network comprising several nodes with
    each node maintaining a copy of the same. The nodes may comprise “users” or “miners”
    who check and validate every transaction occurring on the network for its appropriateness.
    With the “consensus” of users and miners, the data is added to each block. Three
    majorly employed consensus protocols are proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS),
    and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocols. The PoW is the consensus
    protocol strongly associated and integrated with Bitcoin. The miners are involved
    in solving some complex computational problems by finding lesser value than the
    predetermined one in the proposed block. The miner who finds the solution first
    is rewarded and validates the transaction. However, Kuo et al. [[22](#CR22)] claimed
    that it is limited due to its high computational energy requirements when applied
    on a large blockchain which may be equivalent to the electricity required for
    a small country. The stake of each node in the blockchain determines the approval
    node selection process in the PoS. This may give an unfair advantage to richer
    nodes and influence the decision-making. Hence, the randomization process is employed
    to select the approving node. Tandon [[11](#CR11)]. and Padmavathi et al. [[19](#CR19)]
    referred that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is in the process to
    shift from PoW to PoS. The PBFT is based on the Byzantine agreement protocol limiting
    its usage in the public domain as all nodes must be known in the network. It comprises
    three phases, namely, as pre-prepared, prepared, and commit. Each node requires
    two-thirds majority vote approval from all nodes in the network to move to the
    next phase. The PBFT is currently employed in the Hyperledger Fabric. Saraf et

    PoW 是与比特币紧密关联并集成的共识协议。矿工通过找到提出的区块中小于预定值的解来解决一些复杂的计算问题。首先找到解的矿工会得到奖励并验证交易。然而，Kuo

    and corresponding hash values in the block. The timestamp records the actual time
    of transactions as universal time during block creation. The nonce, a 4-byte field,
    has 0 value initially which gets incremented after the calculation of every hash
    function. The parent block hash comprises 256-bit values which link to previous
    blocks in the blockchain [[18](#CR18)]. After each transaction in the block, the
    transaction counter is incremented. The size of the block and transactions decides
    the maximum number of transactions a block can hold. Asymmetric cryptography techniques
    are utilized to authorize and validate the transactions using a digital signature
    technique. Each user in the network uses two keys, namely, private and public
    keys. The private key is confidential, not shared, and employed for digital signatures.
    The signed transactions are then shared over the entire network [[11](#CR11),

    transactions happen, then the need for verification and compilation may arise.
    It is collectively called “validation” and requires the knowledge of mining as
    the validation of a block leads to the creation of new units of cryptos in the
    environment. Once the problem is solved by any miner and a new block has been
    created, everyone on that network must agree that the problem is solved and accept
    it as the next block. The validation of the work is performed by solving the problem
    by oneself and matching with the work done by the other successful miner(s). This
    is a tedious task where proof of work (PoW) comes into play. The miner(s) who
    solves the problem also broadcasts the PoW to other members, so that they could
    accept it and move on to solve the next problem and create the block. Niya et
    al. [[58](#CR58)] stated that the proof of stake (PoS) concept involves the validation
    of block that depends on the number of cryptocurrency tokens that a person already
    owns. It is said that the number of cryptos is directly proportional to the mining
    power by the miner(s). Instead of utilizing energy to answer PoW puzzles, a PoS
    miner is limited to mining a percentage of transactions reflecting the ownership
    stake.

    当大量交易发生时，可能会出现验证和编译的需要。 这被统称为“验证”，并需要矿业知识，因为验证一个区块会导致在环境中创建新的加密单位。 一旦任何矿工解决了问题并创建了新的区块，该网络上的每个人都必须同意问题已经解决，并接受其作为下一个区块。
    通过自己解决问题并与其他成功的矿工完成的工作进行匹配来验证工作的有效性。 这是一项繁琐的任务，工作量证明（PoW）应运而生。 解决问题的矿工也会向其他成员广播PoW，以便他们接受并继续解决下一个问题并创建区块。
    Niya等人[[58](#CR58)]指出，股权证明（PoS）概念涉及取决于一个人已经拥有的加密货币代币数量的区块验证。 据说加密货币的数量与矿工的挖矿能力成正比。
    PoS矿工不是利用能量来回答PoW谜题，而是限制于挖掘反映所有权股份的交易的百分比。

- en: Internet of Things (IoT) was introduced in 1999 and is presently a $50 billion
    industry. It is a network of devices that configure themselves automatically in
    which the human is not at the center of the system. It allows better understanding
    of the environment and response to situations wherein the machines are doing better
    in sensing and reporting conditions. Presently, IoT is involved in home automation
    devices, road safety and traffic regulation, automatic payments, quality assurance,
    and remote condition monitoring. In the future, IoT would be involved in every
    field whether driving of vehicles, wearable devices, scannables, and flyables.
    Although having good connectivity and sensor technology, it is vulnerable to security
    threats due to insecure interfaces and unencrypted communications [[33](#CR33),

    concerns, and aid in decision-making, thereby enhancing the business outcome.
    It is believed that the forecasted global revenue growth of IoT products would
    be around $6.2 trillion with major income from the healthcare sector by 2025\.
    Drosatos et al. [[20](#CR20)] showed concern over the potential to transform healthcare
    and global public health. The IoT business running on a cloud server model would
    generate global revenues of approximately $ 490 billion soon. The major business
    tycoons such as Google and Samsung having NetLabs and SmartThings solutions, respectively,
    are keen on providing innovative IoT technology to their users [[71](#CR71), [79](#CR79)].

    with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication
    protocols where physical and virtual “things” have identities, physical attributes,
    and virtual personalities employing intelligent interfaces that are seamlessly
    integrated into the information network to communicate data associated with users
    and their environments [[6](#CR6), [9](#CR9), [11](#CR11), [23](#CR23), [59](#CR59),
    [81](#CR81), [82](#CR82)]. The major characteristics of an IoT network are that
    it is dynamic and self-adapting and self-configuring with interoperable communication
    protocols and gives unique identity to objects that are integrated into information
    network [[10](#CR10), [12](#CR12)]. An IoT device may consist of several interfaces
    such as sensory, actuators, memory, or audio/video for connections to other devices,
    both wired and wireless. The focus in an IoT network is on configuration, control,
    and networking via the Internet of Devices or Things that are traditionally not
    associated with the Internet. Several devices such as thermostats, utility meter,
    a Bluetooth-connected headset, irrigation pumps, sensors, and control circuits
    for an electric car’s engine can be connected through it [[14](#CR14), [16](#CR16)].
    The IoT technology is being driven by advancements in sensor networks, mobile
    devices, wireless communication, networking, and cloud computing. The scope of
    IoT is not limited to just connecting things (devices, appliances, machines) to
    the Internet. IoT allows the things to communicate and exchange data. Data itself
    does not have a meaning until it is processed into useful information. The information
    is then organized and structured into knowledge for future use when required [[15](#CR15),

    has tremendously transformed and revolutionized the way present healthcare services
    are being provided to patients. Qamar et al. [[3](#CR3)] claimed that the healthcare
    industry is in a state of great despair with rising healthcare costs, an aging
    global population, and an increase in new and chronic diseases. This could lead
    to a state of healthcare services being out of reach of the common man making
    them unproductive and prone to chronic diseases. The IoT technology allows for
    remote monitoring in the healthcare sector, thereby contributing in continuous
    and safe monitoring of the patient’s health condition, empowering physicians to
    deliver quality healthcare at reasonable costs. Fonseca et al. [[13](#CR13)] acknowledged
    that the level of patient-doctor interaction has increased tremendously leading
    to widespread satisfaction with improved healthcare efficiency among patients
    due to ease of interaction with the healthcare providers. This decreased the hospital
    duration stay for the patients and their families showing a deep impact on diminishing
    healthcare costs and improving treatment outcomes [[49](#CR49)]. Several applications
    in the healthcare sector employing IoT are presently available to benefit the
    healthcare providers, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients at large. Mendes
    et al. [[16](#CR16)] disclosed that IoT has largely benefitted critically ill
    patients and the elderly population living alone who require continuous monitoring
    due to their diseased condition by tracking their health condition on a regular
    basis and allowing any disturbances or change in routine daily living activities
    to trigger an alarm to the family member or concerned healthcare providers for
    an immediate check on their condition and to provide instant care and treatment
    to avoid any fatalities or long-term damage [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]. However,
    Priyadharsan et al. [[20](#CR20)] projected that several potential challenges
    exist while designing any IoT-based healthcare system that needs to be addressed
    such as security and privacy, user identification and authentication, and regular
    communication and exchange of healthcare data before the adoption of the technology
    on a mass scale [[14](#CR14), [20](#CR20), [27](#CR27)].

    several difficulties exist in their acceptance such as privacy and security, and
    since data is being transferred to the cloud server, it may easily fall in the
    wrong hands and get misused, thereby compromising safety and privacy of the patient.
    Kuo et al. [[21](#CR21)] embarked on data authenticity, integrity, security, and
    confidentiality which are the major vulnerabilities of an IoT network. Healthcare
    comprises sensitive patient data, and with digitization, it is easy to transfer
    and move manual records in the digitized form which helps in easy storage and
    retrieval. Talpur [[4](#CR4)]. cited that the electronic health record (EHR) is
    digitized that allows easy sharing and analysis of patient data by healthcare
    providers. Catarinucci et al. [[6](#CR6)] and Tandon et al. [[11](#CR11)]. brought
    into light that the digitized record is always under threat of cybercrime to manipulate
    the confidential patient information. The amount of security, privacy, and confidentiality
    of the medical data and its interoperability between different healthcare agencies
    are crucial, and blockchain technology can help to provide robust structure against
    attacks and system failures. The blockchain also prevents the manipulation and
    tampering of healthcare data. Besides, it reduces costs, enhances efficiency,
    and ensures data safety with regulatory compliance with the creation of a secure
    environment and immutable records [[68](#CR68), [78](#CR78)].

    with capability to handle sensor power-off time periods [[19](#CR19), [21](#CR21)].
    It should be able to handle diversity of resources comprising data from different
    sensors and aggregators. For integration of blockchain in IoT, the desirable properties
    are distributed protocol with verifiable transaction history and dynamic multi-party
    signature membership [[22](#CR22)]. The undesirable properties include requirement
    of “proof of work,” PKI requirement, and size of ledger which could be an issue
    for miniature devices and anonymous (unverified) join and leave operations. This
    can be overcome by allowing proof of earlier participation using transaction history,
    employing hash-based signatures or Merkle tree schemes, and maintaining relevant
    transaction ledger when device is too resource constrained and group signatures
    using pre-shared group key(s) to overcome anonymous or unverifiable join and leave
    operations [[24](#CR24), [26](#CR26), [28](#CR28)]. Further, since the IoT technologies
    are increasing exponentially, the IoT devices will always have diverse capabilities
    and resources. The use of cryptography is done without clear understanding of
    the implications, and there are no current standards for lightweight cryptography.
    Hence, blockchain-inspired protocols combined with new cryptographic primitives

    (BIoT) architectures that are lightweight to reduce the communication-induced
    network overhead and are concentrated mostly on smart homes. They cited about
    distributed time-based consensus (DTC) algorithm which reduces the mining processing
    overhead and delay. The BIoT architecture is divided into three layers, namely,
    home, network, and cloud. The home layer comprises interconnected sensing devices
    that store locally collected data with blockchain features. The network layer
    connects the devices with the network or the Internet. The cloud is employed for
    the storage of recorded data. Hasselgren et al. [[18](#CR18)] cited that blockchain
    can be employed with several IoT applications such as healthcare, smart home,
    smart city, supply chain, e-governance, etc. This fusion technology finds several
    applications in industrial automation. If big data is combined with BIoT, it could
    be used to effectively control and monitor the huge amounts of data collected
    in the IoT ecosystem [[18](#CR18), [20](#CR20), [26](#CR26), [28](#CR28)]. Presently,
    the BIoT consortium is quite less in number, and proper regulations are required
    to control different factors that presently affect the implementation of BIoT.
    Padmavathi et al. [[19](#CR19)] showed that the issues of prime importance are
    security, scalability, and cross-platform applications. The commercial products
    on BIoT presently available include Walton chain, Ambrosus, Power Ledger, Block

    and standardized development of products is an important challenge being faced
    in its smooth implementation. Interoperability can be achieved by having mutual
    agreement among all stakeholders involved in the implementation of BIoT framework.
    The government regulations with legal frameworks require real-time product testing
    to avoid system malfunctioning and seamless integration of different aspects of
    the combined technology. Drosatos et al. [[20](#CR20)] and Bhatia et al. [[21](#CR21)]
    stated that due to the high demand for real-time data by industry and research
    organizations, it puts them at a larger risk of theft, break-ins, and unauthorized
    sharing. Further, due to malpractices such as counterfeit drugs, skills of medical
    staff, etc. in the healthcare system, it may erode public trust in the system
    [[52](#CR52), [55](#CR55), [56](#CR56)]. Hence, it is important to implement a
    system that can overcome such disadvantages and improve the overall management
    of the system. Talpur et al. [[4](#CR4)] leads that blockchain technology leads
    the way due to its decentralized approach and data integrity provides a potential
    solution to the potent problems affecting the present-day healthcare system. Catarinucci
    et al. [[6](#CR6)] claimed that blockchain allows greater interoperability, data
    integrity, sharing of information, and provenance among the stakeholders, thereby
    enhancing efficiency, system performance, and most importantly mutual trust among
    parties involved. Xia Qi et al. [[34](#CR34)] introduced the indicator-centric
    schema (ICS), a data model used to simplify the various medical data (like scans,
    reports, x-rays, etc.) and store them efficiently. Separation of frequently used
    data from the infrequently used data can be done using this blockchain model [[34](#CR34),

    be employed for patient-based requirements such as seeking consent, allows privacy,
    and ensures secrecy with continuous monitoring and interaction with the system.
    The issues that may be associated with its implementation include scalability,
    interoperability, and patient management. Blockchain technology can be employed
    for effective management of the electronic health record (EHR) by employing deep
    learning algorithms. Balandina et al. [[7](#CR7)] mentioned the advantages of
    blockchain technology as it reduces paperwork and storage costs, improves efficiency,
    automates processing, and lowers the chances of fraud or mismanagement of the
    secure patient data [[19](#CR19), [23](#CR23), [27](#CR27), [80](#CR80), [82](#CR82)].
    The blockchain technology allows the removal of intermediaries giving more control
    over the information to the patient which is a huge advantage. The technology
    could aid in biomedical research with the help of smart digital contracts to regulate
    the functioning of the biomedical databases. It ensures data integrity and non-repudiation.
    Gong et al. [[8](#CR8)] and Amin et al. [[10](#CR10)] unveiled different pathways
    in the healthcare system for privacy protection as it allows for remote patient
    monitoring with the secure management of medical sensors. The monitoring of patients
    may be done in real time with continuous updates regarding the health condition
    to the patient and the doctors [[29](#CR29), [68](#CR68), [69](#CR69), [71](#CR71),
    [76](#CR76)]. It provides medical interventions with automated notifications to
    the concerned parties. The only disadvantage being data transfer through open
    channels from smart devices to blockchain nodes and due to certain delays in block
    verification, it cannot be used in emergency response situations as the response
    time would increase comprising patient health. The blockchain technology would
    help in overcoming fake drug prescription and labelling due to prudent check mechanism.
    The use of counterfeit drugs leads to adverse drug reactions with over 10 lakhs
    deaths annually as per the World Health Organization (WHO) data. Padmavathi et
    al. [[19](#CR19)] introduced that to avoid the inclusion of such fake drugs in
    the supply chain, transparency must exist to avoid tampering, modifications, or
    stealing of drugs. The pharmacists need to ensure that drugs of correct quantity
    and strength are available. The blockchain also helps in the medical insurance
    storage system that allows transactions to be verified before being added to the
    blockchain network, thereby saving time, costs, and the transaction verification
    process for the insurance company [[18](#CR18), [19](#CR19), [77](#CR77)].

    from healthcare departments or hospitals and the other being personal health records
    comprising information entered usually by patients willingly. Blockchain technology
    has shown immense potential in providing privacy, security, and integrity of healthcare
    records. Alhussein et al. [[12](#CR12)] referred that it is being nowadays used
    in creating patient record ledgers residing at different locations, integrating
    medical records with healthcare enterprises, and sharing of these resources across
    different regions and users. The technology also allows patients to have control
    over their information and can be employed to seek second opinion or referral
    by sharing if required. Blockchain can lead to integration and unification of
    personal health records with medical records and allows easy management of one
    unified healthcare record. The insurance-based health record is encrypted and
    stored without tampering in the blockchain network for future use. Another area
    of blockchain application is to safeguard the transactions of researchers with
    reference biomedical databases such as clinical trials, pharmaceuticals, etc.
    that are updated regularly. Hasselgren et al. [[18](#CR18)] stated that blockchain
    can also be employed to track the drug supply chain from the manufacturer to the
    consumer to avoid counterfeit drugs entering the supply chain. Most of the blockchain
    technologies for medical applications are at the initial stage of maturity or
    being tested for implementation shortly. However, any technology depicting real-time
    solutions is not presently available, and more time is required for the blockchain
    technology to mature in the future [[18](#CR18), [20](#CR20), [57](#CR57), [59](#CR59),
    [63](#CR63), [68](#CR68), [74](#CR74)].

    specific use of their recorded data for research purposes. It also gives freedom
    to patients to connect to hospitals directly and procure their medical data automatically.
    Tandon et al. [[11](#CR11)] told that with the help of ledger technology in blockchain,
    it is possible to securely transfer patient medical records without consideration
    of any boundaries, supply chain management of medicines administered to patients,
    improved coordination among healthcare organizations, fewer transaction costs
    and risks involved and help in genetic research or genomics. This can help in
    streamlining healthcare processes and prevent costly and fatal medical errors.
    Genomics has been considered to improve human health, and several companies are
    exploring the possibility of employing this to understand human health for scientific
    advancement in inpatient treatment and quality healthcare. Bhatia et al. [[21](#CR21)],
    Engelhardt et al. [[23](#CR23)], and Randall et al. [[24](#CR24)] concluded that
    the blockchain and IoT technology are found to be perfectly suitable to this area
    by helping patients to share their encrypted genetic information which allows
    for wider database creation, thereby helping the scientific community in their
    research endeavors as represented in Fig. [22.2](#Fig2). The goal of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology is to enable easy, secure, and efficient use of technology
    for transmission and sharing of data globally. It offers several potential benefits
    in the dynamic digital world leading to personalized healthcare benefits for patients
    and care providers which is not a challenging technological problem anymore. With
    the help of IoT technology for healthcare systems, it is possible to track and
    monitor anything within the system at any convenient time and place on demand.
    The present-day advancements in sensor technology and communication networks and
    the availability of high-performance computing systems and IoT along with blockchain
    technology have been taking rapid strides and coming up as a new potential technology
    that can be explored to provide numerous healthcare benefits at reduced costs
    and time. With the help of these technologies, any device can be used to sense
    its surroundings and do computation employing a wireless network and address.
    This allows developing real-time mapping of virtual objects to establish communication
    channels between them using different communication technologies for information
    about the status of the connected entity as and when required [[26](#CR26), [28](#CR28),

    is prominent across the globe with a large number of people deprived of quality
    healthcare facilities. A large number of start-ups are coming up in this field,
    and several are found in the dermatology field due to its close association with

    the smart devices employed in IoT cannot be directly used in blockchain as they
    are lightweight with energy and memory constraints. By using the traditional client-server
    model in IoT, problems related to data synchronization, security, and data privacy
    may exist. This can be overcome by employing blockchain incorporated within the
    IoT systems. Jing et al. [[26](#CR26)] powered that a blockchain with hypergraphs
    used in smart homes can maintain security and privacy protection by reducing cyber-attack
    possibilities. Rothers et al. [[25](#CR25)] considered that the system must be
    robust enough to allow data privacy and integrity which could be managed with
    a unique identity of devices with little scope of tampering. The system should
    allow scalability and solve problems of data exchange and trading [[40](#CR40),
    [41](#CR41), [46](#CR46)]. With the help of data fusion techniques, the analysis
    could be done on the cloud, thereby improving the healthcare delivery and reducing
    operational expenditures. Reyna et al. [[30](#CR30)] affirmed that healthcare
    data privacy is maintained between the cloud nodes and fog with security through
    blockchain. The advantages include smooth data aggregation, accuracy in the management
    of data, low-cost IoT software, and less consumption of resources. Sultan et al.
    [[27](#CR27)] cited that for smooth IoT functioning, integration with 5G network
    is required and the blockchain transactions may be visible to all if secure communication
    protocols on members are not maintained in the blockchain system [[80](#CR80)].

    distinct advantages. These are *adaptability* as blockchain and IoT integration
    can be easily done without the requirement of intermediate blocks [[13](#CR13),
    [37](#CR37), [39](#CR39)]. Bagha et al. [[28](#CR28)] referred that cross-communication
    can be implemented easily with middleware technologies among blockchain devices.
    The next is *scalability*, and it is the ability of the blockchain network to
    accommodate more IoT devices or sensors on the network without any problem. Fuqaha
    et al. [[29](#CR29)] added that the third advantage is *security*, which is of
    prime importance between the fusion of both blockchain and IoT technologies. Shakeel
    et al. [[15](#CR15)] showed that the security issues in IoT such as denial of
    services (DoS), authorization, identity management, and data protection can be
    overcome by using blockchain. The last one is *consistency*, which implies that
    the data in the system is consistent with the combination of blockchain and IoT.
    This ensures data integrity and allows the autonomous administration of IoT systems
    or domains. It allows every domain in the blockchain network to act independently
    for managing the IoT devices [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]. Hence, with these potential
    benefits, if integration of blockchain with IoT is achieved successfully, then
    it would allow better healthcare patient monitoring, improve service efficiency
    and accurate patient diagnosis, and enhance security with quality services [[32](#CR32),
    [34](#CR34), [35](#CR35), [43](#CR43)]. In their recent study, Kuo et al. [[22](#CR22)]
    presented an overview of blockchain technology to meet the need of futuristic
    biomedical engineering and e-healthcare. The authors have proposed the pseudonym-based
    encryption with different authorities (PBEDA) concept to empower a patient to
    verify, modify, as well as access his/her healthcare data on the IoT-based multi-layered
    system.

    redundant work. By providing high security and data privacy for users, the system
    can become cost-effective with fast computing capabilities. Soon, the blockchain
    technology would immensely benefit and revolutionize the healthcare sector by
    ensuring data transparency, reducing costs of service delivery, central server
    for management of all patient data, and hospital services [[14](#CR14), [19](#CR19)].
    The clinicians can monitor their patient’s condition in real time without worrying
    regarding the level of honest information being provided by their patients. Similarly,
    Tandon [[11](#CR11)]. emphasized that the patients need not worry to get a second
    referral for their medical condition due to the transparency of data and services
    being provided by the healthcare service provider. Further, Kuo et al. [[22](#CR22)]
    pressed that they can willingly share their data to enable them to learn regarding
    similar cases being treated or reported in other countries which would help them
    in improving their present medical condition and nature of services being provided
    by their clinician. Overall the practical utilization of blockchain technology
    can benefit patients, clinicians, healthcare service providers, researchers, and
    biomedical specialists to improve service efficiency, quality of healthcare services,
    and accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases and share patient data with enhanced
    security and privacy [[22](#CR22), [26](#CR26), [33](#CR33), [47](#CR47), [51](#CR51)].
    It would prevent loss or modification of patient data being decentralized and
    transparent in nature. The major concerns for acceptance of this technology are
    the misuse of data by sharing it with third parties for profit or indirect identification
    of users through pseudonymous identifiers [[67](#CR67), [70](#CR70), [73](#CR73)].
    Since research is ongoing in this area and the number of publications is available
    presently, the future for the growth and expansion of this technology looks promising.
    In the healthcare sector, it is expected that the blockchain technology market
    may cross $500 million by 2022\. Hasselgren et al. [[18](#CR18)] informed that
    due to its data integrity and enhancing mutual trust among users, its demand would
    be ever-increasing and required by healthcare institutions to perform their tasks
    with seamless efficiency and precision [[20](#CR20), [22](#CR22), [43](#CR43),

    present IoT-based systems are centralized based mechanisms [[54](#CR54), [60](#CR60),
    [61](#CR61), [62](#CR62)]. The deployment of blockchain in IoT allows distributed,
    decentralized ledger records with high security, privacy, improved efficiency,
    and authenticity of data. The healthcare industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing
    industries globally. The industry is under strict regulatory norms involving complex
    interconnected entities leading to fragmented patient data and enhanced costs
    due to system inefficiencies leading to lack of complete transparency in data
    transactions, data traceability issues, and security concerns for the patient.
    The blockchain technology has gained wide acceptability in different industrial
    domains including healthcare to ensure secure and reliable management of real-time
    clinical healthcare patient data, thereby reducing healthcare costs and accurate
    disclosure of the clinical trials to overcome supply of duplicate or low-quality
    medicines to patients and hospitals. The technology could be employed to support
    patient data management, hospital supply chain management, pharmaceutical research,
    online patient monitoring through hospital telemedicine set-up, and hospital billing

    This review proposes intelligent real-time patient monitoring system to monitor
    the subject’s vital parameters including temperature, pressure, breath activity,
    as well as ECG using specific prototype model and detects any abnormality with
    accuracy. In the near future, the research could be carried out on to focus on
    improving wearing sensor experience by using softer materials and enabling controlled
    sharing of information among the doctors, the patient, and the patients’ family
    through social networking paradigm. The clinicians can monitor the patient’s condition

    an essential role in enhancing people’s daily lives and establishing the connection
    between smart home equipment and a smart atmosphere. IoT systems build the concept
    of smart home, smart cities, smart hospitals and smart building also [[2](#CR2)].
    The industrial sector is also facing the challenges in the development of the

    business model. The major industrial structure, like machines, traffic and components
    etc., the IIoT is facing many operational and technical difficulties, like trustworthiness,
    timeless and security of the connection [[3](#CR3)]. Nowadays, 3GPP and LTE are
    the most widely used technologies for communication with IoT systems [[4](#CR4)],
    because these techniques offer wide area cover, low operation cost, more secure,
    allocated spectrum, and easiness in the management. But the recently available

- en: The success of IoT is based not only on wired but equally on wireless communication
    capabilities. The wireless communication systems have enabled multifold faster
    development and the implementation of IoT systems as the systems are/now can be
    mobile. An IoT system essentially requires the data is transmitted in small packets
    at low transmission rate(s), reducing the bandwidth requirements. Typically, the
    bandwidth requirement for IoT applications is less than 1 MHz. Due to their reliable
    propagation characteristics, sub-GHz bands (Europe utilizes 868 MHz band and the
    USA uses the 915 MHz band) are often preferred. Although these frequency bands
    see less traffic with respect to other bands in the spectrum (like 2.4 GHz band),
    there is always a possibility of interference issues arising from other standards.
    The 5G communication networks provide faster, better and reliable communication
    networks for communicating systems. 5G network constitutes two parts, the Long-Term
    Evolution technology (FR1 – lower-frequency range, up to 6 GHz) and the millimetre
    wave (FR2 – higher-frequency range, from 24 to 52 GHz) [[9](#CR9)]. The 5G antenna
    module for the IoT-based system is designed based on one or more of data rate,
    frequency of operation, range of communication and power consumption. The designer
    has several limitations to work with, namely, small footprint, minimum fading
    (interference) or negligible noise, higher gain and maximum radiation efficiency,
    and an enhanced version of multiplexing order is also required. The substrate
    integrated waveguide (SIW)-based antenna design provides a viable solution offering
    advantages like lightweight, high gain, maximum radiation efficiency, low fabrication
    and maintenance cost, high quality factor (Q) as well as improved power handling
    capacity than its counterparts μ-strip and CPW technology [[10](#CR10)].

    and the like(s). For a multiuser system environment connected with the base station
    consisting of large number of antenna elements, the SIW-based MIMO (multiple-input
    multiple-output) antenna for the 5G band application functional over the frequency
    range of 3.4–3.6 GHz is used. The MIMO system offers zero or negligible amount
    of mutual coupling over a single element. This is achieved by deploying an additional
    diplexer and triplexer decoupling network. A diplexer, triplexer, quadplexer or
    multiplexer is defined as a device that utilizes a single antenna for multiple
    transmitters operating at different frequencies. This decoupling network will
    consist of a diplexer, triplexer, quadplexer or multiplexer element, depending
    upon the number of input ports (feed points, di for two, tri for three, quad for
    four and multi for more than four transmitters), generally incorporated with antenna
    modules. These increase not only the antenna space, size and cost but the complexity
    of the proposed system as well, thus making these systems not suitable for portable
    IoT application or 5G communication systems.

    technology takes the outstanding part because of its prominent features. Previously,
    a decade ago from 1980 to 1990, the 1G-based communications was used, in which
    the basic voice service is used by the consumer with analog-based protocols. At
    this time only voice service was under consideration with PSTN (public switched
    telephone network) and PDMA (packet division multiple access) techniques. 1G technology
    is operated over the frequency of 150 MHz/900 MHz with the narrower bandwidth
    of 30 KHz and lower speed of 2.4 kbps. It has the several of disadvantages like
    bad voice quality, large size and poor battery life of cell phones. At this time,
    it is better than nothing; at least it’s wireless and mobile. After that from
    1991 to 2000, 2G communication had discovered using the new digital technique
    of GSM and CDMA. It is the first digital standard era of wireless communication
    with improved coverage area and capacity of no. of users than 1G technology. It
    is operated at the frequency of 1.8 GHz/900 MHz with the moderate bandwidth of
    25 MHz and data rate of 64 kbps. It allows the text messaging service also, and
    the signals are also stronger than 1G. In this range, 2.5G comes with the GPRS
    cellular technique. It has the additional features of web browsing and e-mail
    services. At this time, the cell phones are combined with camera also. After the
    evolution takes place from 2.5G to 3G wireless system from 2000 to 2010, it has
    the frequency range of 1.6–2.0 GHz with bandwidth of 100 MHz. It is designed by
    CDMA, UMTS and EDGE techniques to provide the digital broadband and increased
    speed. It is the first mobile with broadband data services [[11](#CR11), [12](#CR12)].
    At this time, the cell phones/mobile become the smart mobile with the extra features
    of fast communication, video call and broadcasting, mobile TV, etc. It also has
    the excellent value of data rates of 144 kbps to 2 Mbps with increased no. user
    capacity. These 3G mobiles are rather expensive than 2G. After that a new era
    has introduced with 4G communication from 2010 to 2020 with advent features of
    3G. It is designed primarily for increased data rate from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps.
    It is working at the frequency range of 2–8 GHz with the bandwidth of 100 MHz.
    It depends upon Wi-Fi and LTE technology and has the IP-based protocols and high
    speed and connectivity. It is the true mobile broadband service with MAGIC. The
    MAGIC term is defined as follows: M stands for mobile multimedia, A stands for
    anytime anywhere, G stands for global mobile support, I stands for integrated
    wireless solution, and C stands for customized personal service. 4G is a kind
    of multifunctional and flexible technology which depends upon OFDM (orthogonal
    frequency-division multiplexing) and OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access) techniques. Nowadays, due to the 4G communication technique, we can easily
    and rapidly upload and download the high-definition (HD) video, movies, songs
    and other information. 4G system produces the high quality of services, super
    security and bigger battery life also. Then after 4G, the advanced and versatile
    features of 5G communication are presented with extreme high data rate of 1–100 Gbps,
    which is 100 times higher than 4G communication. The 5G communication has introduced
    from 2020 to 2030 with high capacity and speedy data rates. It also supports voice
    streaming, buckle up, high Internet, and interactive multimedia applications.
    It supports WWWW (World Wide Wireless Web) technology and defines the next version

    The demand of more bandwidth and lower latency has been a motivation to develop
    efficient systems. 5G is the fifth-generation mobile network, and this is the
    wireless communication technology which enhances user experience with the help
    of its features to personalize mobile communication experience. 5G is intended
    to offer higher data speeds (multi-Gbps), better reliability, increased availability,
    enormous network capacity, ultra-low latency and a better than before uniform
    user experience. Improved performance and enhanced efficiency allow new as well
    as better user experiences. 5G provides the infrastructure which will increase
    the performance and capabilities of the communication network. 5G includes high
    carrier frequencies, unprecedented number of antennas, massive bandwidths and
    device density. 5G emerged from orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).
    OFDM is the method of modulating a digital signal across numerous different channels
    to reduce interference. Sub-6 GHz and mm-wave which have wider bandwidth are used
    in 5G technology. The same mobile networking principles like 4G LTE are used in
    5G OFDM. In addition to it, 5G air interface further increases OFDM to give a
    better scalability and flexibility. As a result, more people can have access to
    5G technology [[14](#CR14)].

    satisfies the high demand of traffic and efficient connectivity to the users.
    5G works smoothly even when the number of users connected to the Internet goes
    over billions in number. Basically, 5G uses the unused part of 3–300 GHz high-frequency
    mm-wave. This sub-spectrum of mm-wave spectrum can support improved data rate
    over present wireless system to over hundreds of times to satisfy end user needs.
    5G is designed to efficiently use every bit of spectrum across a wide array of
    available bands and spectrum. 5G is invented to emerge into service areas say,
    for example, connecting the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, virtual
    reality and critical communication systems. This is achieved by 5G NR air interface
    design techniques, like self-contained TDD sub-frame design. 5G is designed to
    be energy efficient; it consumes less energy as compared to prior communication
    devices. This helps in reduction in environmental issues as well as network maintenance
    issues. Current mobile network consumes about 15–20% of total power consumption
    on actual data traffic, and the rest of the energy is wasted [[15](#CR15)].

    with higher network reliability. Businesses could use 5G to connect their devices
    to the same network. By doing this, we can make machines work with the help of
    mobile device. This can be applied where higher degree of precision is needed.
    This will help in increasing the efficiency of businesses and giving users faster
    access to information. 5G technology can also help in intelligent movement and
    communication among vehicles. Traffic management can be achieved by designing
    a network of interconnected vehicles. Real-time data of traffic can be provided
    to the drivers so that vehicles on the road can choose less congested road to
    arrive at destination.

    it is very difficult, if not impossible, to hack, maliciously change, or cheat
    a system. Could this be true? Yes, through a system called blockchain. It is a
    digital ledger or an indefinitely growing list of cryptographically linked blocks
    (records) [[19](#CR19)–[23](#CR23)]. These blocks individually are constituted
    by a collection essentially of a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp
    and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). These are distributed
    as well as duplicated across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.
    It has supported the transition to a much required cryptographically secured and
    decentralized network from the existing centralized client-server systems (Internet).
    It facilitates the users to have a distributed P2P network, where information

- en: In the last few years, wireless communication systems have been mostly developed
    in diplexing and triplexing, maintaining additional and extraordinary functionality
    and compactness. The major part of conventional diplexing- or triplexing-based
    communication system is diplexer/triplexer as shown in Fig. [23.6](#Fig6), in
    which the uplink and downlink channels of transmitter and receiver signal are
    in neighbouring frequency bands. To enhance the isolation between the uplink and
    downlink bands, transmission noise rejection and low power transmission for the
    transceiver, we will propose planar SIW-based self-diplexed/triplexed antennas.![../images/501059_1_En_23_Chapter/501059_1_En_23_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_23_Chapter/501059_1_En_23_Fig6_HTML.png)

    the use of single device by multiple transmitters or receivers on different frequencies
    reducing cost, space and requirement of addition circuit components. This device
    may either facilitate transmission from more than one transmitter over a single
    RF antenna, or it may be used to work as a transceiver for transmitting over one
    frequency band while receiving is done on another band of frequency [[24](#CR24)].

- en: The antenna diplexer has multiple applications. The most common application
    is to be used as a transceiver at a cellular base station for simultaneous inflow
    and outflow of signals. This device (self-duplexing antenna) provides high isolation
    between the used receiving and transmitting feeds, thus allowing the same device
    to operate for transmission/reception simultaneously blocking the signal. An alternate
    application for the device could be at a broadcast station, where signal is simultaneously
    transmitted with many a different frequencies with one antenna element. The device’s
    operation prevents the output of any of the transmitters being fed back into the
    other’s input, thus enabling the use of a single antenna.

    and downlink. With the help of self-diplexed antenna, we can reduce the complexity
    of high-order diplexer network, which leads to minimum cost and small size of
    overall RF (radio-frequency) front-end system. From the last few years, the state
    of the art of SIW technology becomes a very promising candidate to the implementation
    and realization of conventional waveguide and other non-planar circuits into their

    implement the four-port single antenna with high isolation values.

    field. DGS can be found by etching off any shape over the ground plane, as its
    name describes itself. DGS depends upon the dimension and shape of the defect.
    Due to DGS method, the shielded current distribution is also disturbed, which
    results in the propagation of electromagnetic wave through the substrate layer.
    For getting the better performance of the system, the shape of defect may be altered
    from simple to complex. With the help of DGS, the isolation between the ports
    can be increased, and mutual coupling can be reduced also, e.g. dumbbell and bowtie-shaped,
    etc. [[26](#CR26), [44](#CR44), [45](#CR45)].

    e.g. 3-D, 2-D and 1-D EBG, mushroom and uni-polar EBG, etc. [[46](#CR46), [47](#CR47)].

    this methodology can be proposed for SIW-based antennas also, where the loaded
    grounding vias are considered as shunt inductors and produce the inductive effect.
    This method can also enhance the isolation between ports and gives the better
    tuning of frequency response [[37](#CR37), [38](#CR38)].

    techniques. Data Communication Systems use a device called IoT antenna for data
    transmission and reception. These antennas are compact and flexible in nature
    to operate within 5G bands as in lower and upper both bands. These bands are defined
    in Table [23.6](#Tab6). An antenna is a passive electromagnetic device used to
    transfer the information from one place to another. For this transmitting as well
    as receiving, both antennas are used generally in communication and RF front-end
    systems. Previously, the antenna systems were combined with the diplexer and triplexer
    elements. These elements are kind of frequency selective or filter element and
    used to recognize the particular frequency. The self-diplexing, self-triplexing
    and self-quadplexing antenna, are mostly implemented by SIW technology, these
    antennas find applications for satellite/RADAR communication, and can be integrated
    with IoT applications best use. These are defined in sub-sections as below [[49](#CR49)].Table

    of ADS (Advanced Design System) software. Here each parallel combination of RLC

    parallel combination of *R* [2], *L* [2] and *C* [2] produces the second resonant
    frequency. The mutual coupling (M[12]) between two frequencies is defined by series
    combination of *LC* network. Here *L* [12] and *C* [12] present the minimum isolation

    frequencies. Previously the triplexers are used in RF front-end systems for selecting
    and filtering the required three frequencies used for further communication. This
    triplexer is used to provide the required isolation value among three ports; however,
    this geometry contains more space in overall system. So, the self-triplexing antennas
    are introduced in RF field to remove the extra circuitry as triplexer from communication
    system [[50](#CR50)–[56](#CR56)]. These proposed antennas are more in demand,
    and RF researchers are mostly working in this field to integrate it with other
    technology like artificial intelligence, sensors, etc. The comparison among self-triplexing
    antennas and triplexer is displayed in Table [23.7](#Tab7).Table 23.7

- en: The equivalent circuit model for self-triplexing antenna is shown in Fig. [23.11](#Fig11).
    The triplexing antenna works at three resonating frequencies, and each resonating
    frequency is defined by the parallel section of RLC network connected with the
    port of 50 ohm line. At that time, only single port is ON and produces the corresponding
    resonating frequency. The first RLC network as *R* [1], *L* [1] and *C* [1] produces
    the first resonant frequency; likewise, the second and third parallel RLC sections
    give the second and third operating frequencies. The isolation is the main parameter
    of the proposed antenna, so the mutual coupling is defined by the M[12], M[23]
    and M[31] components, where M[12] shows the mutual coupling between port 1 and
    port 2\. Similarly, the M[23] and M[31] define the minimum mutual coupling between
    port 2 and port 3 and port 3 and port 1\. The proposed equivalent model can be
    easily realized by ADS software and justified by HFSS also. The value of each
    resonating frequency can be obtained by Eq. ([23.5](#Equ5)).![../images/501059_1_En_23_Chapter/501059_1_En_23_Fig11_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_23_Chapter/501059_1_En_23_Fig11_HTML.png)

    of interest and blocked the others, so quadplexer is also the same element used
    to find out the four required frequencies with the help of each port. This is
    mostly used in satellite-, RADAR- and RF-based systems to eliminate the noise
    and unwanted frequencies; only the desired range of frequency can be passed by
    the four ports of the quadplexer element. It requires the extra space in any of
    RF communication systems to provide the isolation or low coupling among the input
    ports, so the latest technology named as self-quadplexing antenna is introduced
    by RF researches. It is the most prominent technique used in RF front-end system
    with light weight, compact space and low losses [[57](#CR57)–[60](#CR60)]. Here
    several features of self-quadplexing antenna are explained in Table [23.8](#Tab8).
    Nowadays, this proposed quadplexing technique is implemented with the help SIW
    methodology, to get extreme better results than others.Table 23.8

- en: The equivalent circuit model for the self-quadplexing antenna is displayed in
    Fig. [23.12](#Fig12). The quadplexing antenna module contains the four input ports,
    and the isolation is defined among all ports in terms of mutual coupling. Here
    all four resonating frequencies are determined by the parallel combination of
    RLC network, and mutual coupling is attained by series combination of LC networks.
    One port is ON simultaneously and produces the particular resonant frequency.
    The mutual coupling is known in the form of interference, so the minimum mutual
    coupling is reciprocal to high isolation value and it is proportional to low interference
    among input ports. The mutual coupling among four ports is defined by M[12], M[23],
    M[34] and M[41]. This model can be implemented by ADS software with the help of
    no. of equations, and electromagnetic structure can be executed by HFSS or CST
    software.![../images/501059_1_En_23_Chapter/501059_1_En_23_Fig12_HTML.png](../images/501059_1_En_23_Chapter/501059_1_En_23_Fig12_HTML.png)

- en: With the substantial development of the latest mobile and satellite communication,
    the multiple frequency antennas with high isolation and low mutual coupling are
    one of the particular interests. The SIW (SIW)-based single-layered self-diplexing,
    self-triplexing and self-quadplexing antenna has been proposed for mobile and
    satellite communication, the design techniques help to achieve high isolation
    and low mutual coupling between transmitting and receiving antenna. Additionally,
    low cross-polarization, high gain and maximum front-to-back ratio are obtained.
    These proposed antennas are used in RF front-end system without the need of extra
    circuitry like diplexer and triplexer. These antennas have low manufacturing cost,
    light weight and low losses; by virtue of this, it can be easily incorporated
    with 5G-enabled applications and IoT-based applications also. As the upcoming
    era will become fully 5G and IoT-enabled communication, then proposed antennas
    as self-diplexing, self-triplexing and self-quadplexing antennas are of great
    and fit choice for RF researchers and engineers.
