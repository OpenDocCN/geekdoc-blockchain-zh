- en: This book is the product of many people’s ideas and work. It would not have
    been possible without the open and supportive blockchain and cryptocurrency world.
    I’d like to thank specifically Paul Snow, Peter Kirby, Brian Deery, and David
    Johnston for the countless hours spent teaching me about blockchain and cryptography.
    I’d also like to thank Abhi Dobhal, Lawrence Rufrano, Ryan Fugger, Charley Cooper,
    Alyse Killeen, Jeremy Kandah, Clemens Wan, Greg Wallace, Brian Behlendorf, Amir
    Chetrit, Jared Tate, Casey Lawlor, and Scott Robinson for the direction and guidance
    in the evolving blockchain space and for taking time out of their busy lives to
    review and sanity-check my work.

- en: This book also took a lot of editing. I’m not kidding it really took a lot of
    editing. My project editor, Elizabeth Kuball, did a great job keeping me on task
    and on schedule, and Steve Hayes, my executive editor, made the whole book possible.
    I’d also like to thank Scott Robinson again for his thorough technical review
    and excellent suggestions, as well as editor Pat O’Brien and all the other behind-the-scenes
    people, who did thankless jobs to bring this book about. I’m forever in their
    debit.
