    alongside the ledgal, process and technical standards. It should be noted that
    supervising a blockchain and DLT “network” is more complex than supervising central
    market infrastructures. Nodes on the same network might be established in different
    geographies/jurisdictions and subject to local privacy and governance requirements

    a key requirement (Catalini and Gans [2016](#CR16)). In a commercial context,
    privacy entails the protection and appropriate use of the personal information

    under the circumstances” (Swire and Bermann [2007](#CR47)). Today, large technology
    companies and financial institutions have wide and historic data about persons,
    their identities and transactions. Private data has become valuable information
    to feed artificial intelligence for new commercial models (Akgiray [2019](#CR3)).
    These new technologies are straining the traditional legal frameworks of privacy.
    Today, people willingly and freely supply their private information until they
    lose control of their privacy.^([4](#Fn4)) As more information is recorded and
    made accessible, it becomes easier for people to be judged on the basis of their
    past actions. The privacy problem is now more complicated with a global profile.
    The enforceability of information privacy laws can be undermined if organisations
    are able to escape country-specific regulatory responsibilities by transmitting
    those data to other jurisdictions for analysis (Pearson [2012](#CR36)).

    between the guidance that regulations provide and decisions that organisations
    need to make about the collection and use of information (Pearson [2012](#CR36)).
    Organisations processing personal data must ensure that their operations comply
    with applicable privacy regulations, as well as with consumer expectations, but
    this can be very challenging. In a “borderless world”, created through the IoV,
    public policies to protect personal privacy are inextricably interdependent (Bennet

    increased dramatically (Pearson [2012](#CR36)). Companies must find ways to demonstrate
    responsible practices to integrate ethics, values and new forms of risk assessment
    within their organisation. While privacy supports the establishment and maintenance
    of trust between service providers and users, it is universally accepted as best
    practice that such privacy mechanisms should be built in as early as possible
    into a system’s lifecycle (Pearson [2012](#CR36)).

    Indeed, although blockchain should, in principle, enhance the traceability of
    transactions—and hence, transparency—the encryption of the information could make
    it harder to disentangle and process it, at least in the short term (CPTM [2016](#CR20)).
    This would effectively render supervisory work more challenging. Blockchain and
    DLT standards and governance need to be introduced in each country to control/manage
    the adoption, both within the country and between countries. From a common standard
    view, ISO 307 is developing a governance/regulatory technology standard. Within
    countries, regulators need to consider the developing standard-based frameworks
    to govern the interactions between participants, both “permissioned” and “non-permissioned”.
    These rules would need to address many potentially complex issues. Examples include
    the liabilities of the respective participants in the event of, for example, fraud
    and error, correction mechanisms and penalties in the event of rule infringement,
    the intellectual property attached to the technology, or the territoriality of
    the law likely to apply to the network (CPTM [2016](#CR20)).

    directors, who have the ultimate legal responsibility for the strategic future,
    performance and conformance of their organisation, have both ethical and fiduciary
    care responsibilities to be competent to govern technology. Although industry
    and government have developed the precautionary principle, especially in their
    drive to manage the governance of technology (Stirling [2016](#CR46)), this also
    fails to address the specific nature of disruptive digital technologies (Blockchain,
    AI, Big Data) on business. There is clearly a need to control the development
    of online digital-based services and markets by ensuring responsible innovation
    (Stilgoe et al. [2013](#CR45)) and technology governance (Stirling [2016](#CR46))

    technologies and innovation responsibly, so that it is developed to promote creativity

    Information Technology (IT) governance and the strategic alignment of boards within
    different industries. As Gordon ([2012](#CR25)) concluded, there is no significant
    relationship between IT strategic alignment and levels of IT governance structure
    and federal IT governance structure. To be effective, technology governance should
    support three main objectives: “(a) regulatory and legal compliance, (b) operational

    digital technologies, which will have a significant impact on the overall corporate
    governance for boards of directors. Alongside improved trust one of blockchain’s
    biggest promises is the elimination of some or all intermediaries (Maull et al.

    up to their technology governance responsibilities and link to their key measures
    of share price, revenue and profit, through reputational risk. As stated by Aula
    ([2010](#CR9)), reputational risk is a top concern for many boards, as the current
    impacts of product failure are immediately reported in social media which, while
    affecting the share price, also has an impact on the consumer/supplier trust relationship.
    “The loss of reputation affects competitiveness, local positioning, the trust
    and loyalty of stakeholders, media relations, and the legitimacy of operations,
    even the licence to exist... leading European managers to consider reputation
    risk to be the primary threat to business operations and the market value of their
    organisations” (Aula [2010](#CR9), p. 44). The conduct of the company, the associated
    operational risk and trust in the company are all the responsibility of the board
    in the drive to strengthen corporate governance (Child and Rodrigues [2004](#CR17)).
    Clearly, technology governance and the link between risk and trust is a developing
    and a necessary area of research, especially in financial services, where there

    ([2004](#CR37)) examined technology governance as organisational capacity exercised
    by the board, executive management and IT management. Meanwhile, Weill and Ross
    ([2004](#CR53)) went so far as “requiring senior levels to specify decision rights
    and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behaviour in the use of
    technology”. This view of technology governance in this context is primarily concerned
    with IT project selection and prioritisation issues and how the authority for
    resources and the responsibility for IT are shared between business partners,
    IT management and service providers (Weill and Ross [2004](#CR53), [2005](#CR54)).

    the decision rights, incentives and the accountability framework to encourage
    desirable behaviour. This includes the foundational mechanisms in the form of
    the leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure that the
    organisation’s technology sustains and extends the organisation’s strategies and
    objectives”. What is missing in this definition is the context, in that the technology
    governance needs to integrate with the business strategy and delivery requirements.
    Van Grembergen et al. ([2004](#CR49)) posited that technology governance includes
    “the combination of leadership, structures and processes’ and it will achieve
    the fusion of business and IT”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    strategies and objectives (IT Governance Institute [2003](#CR29)). In this manner,
    technology governance has become an important integral part of corporate governance
    (Ko and Fink [2010](#CR32)). Technology governance within a business should focus
    on the organisational alignment, integration and relationships. It is apparent
    that benefits arise when technology and business activities are aligned, so that
    they both share the objective of achieving organisational goals (Gordon [2012](#CR25)).
    In terms of business, technology provides the means to integrate organisational
    activities by eliminating duplication and bottlenecks. The activity of governance
    itself improves the understanding, and hence the working relationship, between
    technology and the rest of the business. Consequently, benefits can be readily
    identified, such as returns in the form of increased revenue/profits, and the
    balance struck between value creation (risk-taking) and security (risk managing).
    However, what is apparent is that the various detailed concepts of technology
    governance are still evolving, mainly because of “the specialisation and disconnectedness
    between globally-dispersed IT governance interested communities” (Peterson [2004](#CR37), p.
    41) which are appearing with the IoV.

    required to ensure there is integration between “mission, strategy, values, norms
    and culture, and to promote desirable IT behaviours and governance outcomes” (Weill

    Bradley et al. [2012](#CR14)) and performance. Technology governance is critically
    important, as it is seen to have a substantial impact on return on investment
    in IT. In fact, Weill and Ross ([2004](#CR53), pp. 3–4) argued that “effective
    IT governance is the single most important predictor of the value an organisation
    generates from IT”. It is evident that “strategic alignment can be achieved by
    implementing well-designed technology governance mechanisms” (Weill and Ross [2005](#CR54)).

    and hence their real-world identities are largely protected via private key cryptography
    (Van Rijmenam et al. [2017](#CR50)). However, details of transactions are still
    fully transparent because the distributed ledgers are shared by all. Users can
    adopt “privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g. use a new address for each transaction
    and obfuscate their transactions by mixing them with others), rely on an intermediary
    (e.g. a digital wallet provider) or use a system that separates basic information
    about a transaction (e.g. its existence and timestamp) from more sensitive attributes”

    new protocols are being developed to mask transaction data. These protocols aim
    to offer anonymity to users through zero-knowledge cryptography and implement
    different degrees of access to transaction information. Despite the fact it might
    not always be possible to achieve perfect masking or obfuscation might (Barak
    et al. [2001](#CR10)), it is clear that different blockchain implementation will
    also be able to compete in terms of the privacy level they provide to their users
    (either at the protocol level or through a trusted intermediary). When combined
    with privacy-enhancing measures, this can solve the trade-off “between users’

- en: Many of the practical developments to date for the IoV and blockchain have been
    collaborative, requiring cooperation among multiple participants. Governance of
    these collaborative organisations is critical to the success of these projects.
    Many enterprise blockchain solutions will be implemented by a “consortium” of
    enterprises, building one or more applications on top of a “blockchain platform”,
    such as we.trade and Voltron in trade finance (Rutter [2017](#CR41)).

    using the concept of Fintech (Chiu [2016](#CR18); Puschmann [2017](#CR38)) as
    incubator technology functions within their organisation to lever new technology,
    innovation and deliver new solutions that will affect a change in the culture,
    internal trust, business model, the market and supply chain. Although this is
    an attempt to change the way they manage and govern the development of technology,
    some innovators are embarking on deploying new technologies without a clear vision
    or link through strategic alignment to the business model, technology governance
    or risk.

- en: Blockchain and DLT are relatively base technologies which, when developed with
    toolboxes (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric) can see their functionality easily extended.
    Research has shown (Rutter [2017](#CR41)) that the current approaches to the development
    of blockchain technologies typically consider a relatively small business problem,
    e.g. the provenance of a single good—wine, diamonds, spinach or a micropayment
    between counterparties. The developed solution is then progressed by the consortium
    through the iterative development of the business problem, which is then extended
    to new areas, adding in complexities of the supply chain and then developing the
    technology. Therefore, the governance of the technology should follow this iterative
    cycle, developing as complexity is added.

- en: The overall governance of the consortium will be as important to enterprises
    as “blockchain platform” governance. Consortium level governance “permeates” through
    all aspects of the blockchain, and governance is an integral component of a sustainable
    network (Arun et al. [2019](#CR5)).

- en: When the requirements for governance within the enterprise are considered as
    detailed earlier, combined with the position of the IoV to change the trust/risk
    and value models, it is clear the IoV does require a more sophisticated governance
    and privacy model.

    be a mix of industry practitioners, government/regulators and academic scholars.
    Technology governance and privacy of the IoV could be based on the principles
    to ensure that all participants and stakeholders in the ecosystem are represented,
    and focus on and address the following issues: implementation of the business
    model, determination of intellectual property ownership and how to manage funds
    to support the blockchain project. These principles will need to be expanded to
    address the vertical and horizontal gaps in governance that are seen within the
    developing IoV. While, typically, most blockchain consortia will be governed through
    traditional entities, an alternative is a “contractual joint venture” in which
    all the rights and obligations are managed through a collaborative approach, with
    an overarching contract. In this model, the participants have “joint liability”
    for funding. While decision-making can also be difficult, the collaboration needs
    to be closely managed as the approval of all members may be required to act.'

    of consortia governance and it includes companies from the wine industry, service
    providers to these companies (for example, freight forwarders in logistics blockchain
    project consortia), academic institutions, non-profit institutions, software developers
    and users of the blockchain project. The Reducing Friction in Trade—Wine programme
    consortium is driven through a mix of collaboration and governance both business,
    and technology between the various stakeholders. Privacy of data and access controls
    are built in to the underlying blockchain technology. A programme board has been
    established across UK Government, Industry and Academia representing the major
    stakeholders in the Reducing Friction in Trade—Wine programme. Holmes ([2020](#CR27))
    headed by the author as the Programme Lead.

- en: Today, standard governance and privacy frameworks are mostly organisationally
    bound, and they are not orientated to support developing digital technologies
    and the distributed nature of the IoV. It is also established (Valentine and Stewart
    [2013](#CR48)) that there is a disconnect between technology and corporate governance
    and the risk/regulatory standards and the technology delivery processes (Wu et al.
    [2015](#CR56)). There are gaps between business strategies, corporate governance
    operations, risk management, technology governance and delivery within an organisation—vertical
    integration is missing for digital technologies. Most developments were made in
    the 1990s and 2000s, and they are not aligned to the drivers of this decade.

- en: With the introduction of IoV, more horizontal integration gaps appear, as each
    stakeholder has a different set of strategies, processes, organisations and drivers.
    The IoV is developing new trust, value and risk business models across stakeholders
    from different organisations. Therefore, the development of new frameworks needs
    to take place, which address the changing decision rights, accountability and
    incentives, communication and organisational constructs. These must meet the multi-stakeholder
    distributed nature of this new world.

    that considers the new business models within the IoV and iteratively uses components
    from the building block to continually develop the governance mechanism. The implementation
    of governance is not a one-off task; technology governance and privacy frameworks
    need to adapt, as the business models within the IoV develop continually. Leaving
    governance to the technical developments and embedding it “on-chain” poses risks
    for the stakeholders, consumers and suppliers within the IoV.
