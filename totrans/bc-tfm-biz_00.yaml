- en: A major cause of poverty and conflict is the failure to transform resources
    into capital without predation by intermediaries (e.g. government corruption,
    corporate mischief) in that process. As an economist and entrepreneur, I am passionate
    about Blockchain’s potential to plug such structural leakages.

  zh: 贫困和冲突的一个主要原因是，在资源转化为资本的过程中，中间商（例如政府腐败、企业恶行）的掠夺导致了结构性泄漏。作为一名经济学家和企业家，我对区块链的潜力充满热情，它有可能堵住这些结构性漏洞。

    headquarters in New York for the Sustainable Development Summit. That event was
    the launch pad for action by the international community and national governments
    to promote shared prosperity and well-being for all. The UN wants to end poverty
    by 2030\. The question is how.

- en: 'I first heard about Blockchain: Transforming Your Business and Our World during
    the Third Global Blockchain Summit held in Shanghai in September 2017\. After
    delivering my keynote, I attended a lunch hosted by one of its sponsors. Seated
    next to me was one of the co-authors of this ambitious and inspirational book.
    We talked about ways that blockchain-based business solutions and philanthropy
    could address some of the world’s ‘Wicked Problems’, as the authors call them.
    It is in this spirit that Van Rijmenam and Ryan have approached their book. Focusing
    on five of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the authors suggest practical
    and commercially applicable blockchain-based solutions.'

  zh: 我第一次听说《区块链：改变你的业务和我们的世界》这本书是在2017年9月在上海举行的第三届全球区块链峰会上。在做了主题演讲后，我参加了一个由峰会赞助商主持的午餐。坐在我旁边的是这本书的一位合著者。我们谈论了基于区块链的商业解决方案和慈善事业如何解决世界上所谓的“棘手问题”。范·里杰曼和瑞安正是以这种精神来对待他们的书。聚焦于联合国17个可持续发展目标中的五个，作者提出了实际且具有商业适用性的基于区块链的解决方案。
- en: 'From the outset, this book makes explicit its intention: to identify ways that
    blockchain technology can solve some of the world’s more complex problems. Drawing
    on the cultural and philosophical forces that combined make the blockchain’s primordial
    soup, the authors have applied their democratic and optimistic vision of how sophisticated
    distributed ledger technology can be used for social good. They also make a compelling
    case for how it can be adapted to meet commercial and business needs. Van Rijmenam
    and Ryan demonstrate in each of their proposals that they are adherents to the
    view that sustainable development is about ensuring transparency, fair trade,
    independent media, and financial inclusion. Indeed, we live in times when no one
    on the planet is immune to fake news, corruption, identity theft, counterfeit
    labelling, and bad data.'

  zh: 从一开始，这本书就明确地表达了它的意图：找出区块链技术如何解决世界上一些更复杂的问题。作者们吸取了促使区块链的原浆结合的文化和哲学力量，并将他们民主和乐观的愿景应用于复杂的分布式账本技术如何用于社会公益。他们还提出了一个令人信服的论点，说明它可以适应满足商业和商业需求。范·里杰曼和瑞安在他们的每一个提议中都表明，他们是这样观点的拥护者：可持续发展是关于确保透明度、公平贸易、独立媒体和金融包容性的。事实上，我们生活在一个时代，地球上没有一个人对假新闻、腐败、身份盗窃、假冒标签和糟糕的数据免疫。
- en: Starting with a clear and relevant explanation of how blockchain technology
    works, each chapter in this book builds on the one before. From identity to censorship
    and welfare fraud to tax havens, each analysis identifies a particular problem,
    the traditional or incumbent attempts to solve it, and the features of blockchain
    technology that can be applied to achieving those solutions. It is already well
    established that this revolutionary technology will transform systems and processes
    that manage payments, identity, and supply chains. However, until this book, it
    has been unclear how blockchain can also be applied for social good. There is
    a danger that not everyone will have access to the benefits that will flow from
    improved security and efficiency in tracking and storing information and assets,
    but Van Rijmenam and Ryan spell out how blockchain will help us build a better
    society for all.

  zh: 从对区块链技术如何工作的清晰而相关的解释开始，这本书的每一章都建立在前面一章的基础上。从身份认证到审查制度，从福利欺诈到避税天堂，每一篇分析都识别了一个特定的问题，传统的或现有的解决方案尝试，以及可以应用于实现这些解决方案的区块链技术的特点。已经很明确，这种革命性的技术将改变管理支付、身份和供应链的系统和流程。然而，直到这本书出现，区块链如何应用于社会公益一直还不清楚。存在一个危险，即不是所有人都能享受到通过改进信息跟踪和资产存储的安全性和效率所带来的好处，但是Van
    Rijmenam和Ryan详细说明了区块链将如何帮助我们为所有人建立一个更好的社会。
- en: It is refreshing that this work can be read as both a useful resource and a
    call to action. For governments, professionals, businesses, industry, and academics,
    this book offers an insight into blockchain technology, and makes accessible some
    of its more complicated features. For technologists, it lends purpose to their
    work and articulates the often-silenced expectations of the millions of unbanked,
    underemployed, and displaced peoples from countries plagued by corruption, political
    unrest, and natural disasters. These same people represent new markets of potential
    consumers keen to unleash their entrepreneurial potential in the world.

  zh: 令人耳目一新的是，这本书既可以作为有用的资源，也可以作为行动的号召。对于政府、专业人士、企业、工业和学术界来说，这本书提供了对区块链技术的洞察，并使其一些更复杂的特性变得容易理解。对于技术专家来说，它为他们的研究工作赋予了目的，并阐明了数百万未银行、未充分就业和流离失所的人民的期望，这些人民来自饱受腐败、政治动荡和自然灾害困扰的国家。同样的人代表了新的市场，这些潜在的消费者渴望在世界上释放他们的企业家精神。
- en: Just as the UN has called upon global leaders to work together towards the 17
    Sustainable Development Goals, this book calls upon those working to reach those
    Goals to think about how new technologies like blockchain can help to achieve
    them. I found this book to be a thorough guide to the transformative potential
    of blockchain technology.

  zh: 正如联合国呼吁全球领导人携手合作实现17个可持续发展目标，这本书也呼吁那些为实现这些目标而努力的人们思考如何运用像区块链这样的新技术来帮助实现这些目标。我发现这本书对区块链技术的变革潜力进行了全面的指导。
