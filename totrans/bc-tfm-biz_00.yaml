    into capital without predation by intermediaries (e.g. government corruption,
    corporate mischief) in that process. As an economist and entrepreneur, I am passionate
    about Blockchain’s potential to plug such structural leakages.

    headquarters in New York for the Sustainable Development Summit. That event was
    the launch pad for action by the international community and national governments
    to promote shared prosperity and well-being for all. The UN wants to end poverty
    by 2030\. The question is how.

    the Third Global Blockchain Summit held in Shanghai in September 2017\. After
    delivering my keynote, I attended a lunch hosted by one of its sponsors. Seated
    next to me was one of the co-authors of this ambitious and inspirational book.
    We talked about ways that blockchain-based business solutions and philanthropy
    could address some of the world’s ‘Wicked Problems’, as the authors call them.
    It is in this spirit that Van Rijmenam and Ryan have approached their book. Focusing
    on five of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the authors suggest practical
    and commercially applicable blockchain-based solutions.'

    blockchain technology can solve some of the world’s more complex problems. Drawing
    on the cultural and philosophical forces that combined make the blockchain’s primordial
    soup, the authors have applied their democratic and optimistic vision of how sophisticated
    distributed ledger technology can be used for social good. They also make a compelling
    case for how it can be adapted to meet commercial and business needs. Van Rijmenam
    and Ryan demonstrate in each of their proposals that they are adherents to the
    view that sustainable development is about ensuring transparency, fair trade,
    independent media, and financial inclusion. Indeed, we live in times when no one
    on the planet is immune to fake news, corruption, identity theft, counterfeit
    labelling, and bad data.'

- en: Starting with a clear and relevant explanation of how blockchain technology
    works, each chapter in this book builds on the one before. From identity to censorship
    and welfare fraud to tax havens, each analysis identifies a particular problem,
    the traditional or incumbent attempts to solve it, and the features of blockchain
    technology that can be applied to achieving those solutions. It is already well
    established that this revolutionary technology will transform systems and processes
    that manage payments, identity, and supply chains. However, until this book, it
    has been unclear how blockchain can also be applied for social good. There is
    a danger that not everyone will have access to the benefits that will flow from
    improved security and efficiency in tracking and storing information and assets,
    but Van Rijmenam and Ryan spell out how blockchain will help us build a better
    society for all.

    call to action. For governments, professionals, businesses, industry, and academics,
    this book offers an insight into blockchain technology, and makes accessible some
    of its more complicated features. For technologists, it lends purpose to their
    work and articulates the often-silenced expectations of the millions of unbanked,
    underemployed, and displaced peoples from countries plagued by corruption, political
    unrest, and natural disasters. These same people represent new markets of potential
    consumers keen to unleash their entrepreneurial potential in the world.

    Sustainable Development Goals, this book calls upon those working to reach those
    Goals to think about how new technologies like blockchain can help to achieve
    them. I found this book to be a thorough guide to the transformative potential
    of blockchain technology.
