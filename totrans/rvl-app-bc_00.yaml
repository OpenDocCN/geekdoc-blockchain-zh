- en: Nowadays, Blockchain technology is an emerging topic due to its ability to provide
    decentralized storage of information, transparency, immutability and to establish
    trust in an open networked system. It is expected that the applications using
    blockchain for data security and privacy will soon replace the existing technologies
    that provide centralized storage. There are prospects of applying blockchain technology
    in many industries including digital currency, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare,
    supply chain management, banking, retail, insurance, logistics and public sectors.
    In fact, the management, access control, circulation, and sharing of any high-valued
    data should use blockchains.

  zh: 如今，由于其提供去中心化存储信息、透明度、不可变性以及在开放网络系统中建立信任的能力，区块链技术成为一个新兴话题。预计使用区块链进行数据安全和隐私保护的应用将很快取代提供中心化存储的现有技术。在数字货币、物联网（IoT）、医疗保健、供应链管理、银行业、零售业、保险业、物流业和公共部门等许多行业中，都有应用区块链技术的前景。事实上，任何高价值数据的管理、访问控制、流通和共享都应该使用区块链技术。
- en: In simple words, blockchain can be seen as a distributed database of online
    records on a peer-to-peer network that comprises a list of ordered blocks chronologically.
    Typically used in financial transactions for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the peer-to-peer
    blockchain technology records transactions without exception, in exchange to form
    an online ledger system. In other words, this is a decentralized and trustworthy
    system that is not relying on any third party. Trust relation among distributed
    nodes is established by mathematical methods and cryptography technologies instead
    of semi-trusted central institutions. The benefit of such a system is that it
    is distributed, permission-based and secure, hence it is called to be a public
    blockchain network. Distribution allows for a shared form of record keeping, meaning
    that each person within a business network has the possibility to verify the transaction
    made via the blockchain and, with permission, they can trail the record back to
    its source. The block is immutable, no one has sole ownership, and no one can
    delete the record of a transaction within the chain. It also facilitates data
    audit and accountability by having the capability to trace tamper-resistant historical
    record in the ledger. Depending on the actual deployment, data in the ledger can
    be stored in the encrypted form using different cryptographic techniques; hence,
    preserving data privacy. Further, it provides the pseudo-anonymity property, i.e.
    in the sense that the users are able to protect their real identities. Moreover,
    smart contracts (i.e. a kind of self-executing program deployed on the distributed
    blockchain network) can be used to support diverse functions for different application
    scenarios. For example, the conditions and terms of smart contract can be introduced
    by users and the smart contract will only be executed if these terms/ conditions
    are fulfilled. Hence, this hands over control to the owner of the data. Furthermore,
    no malware can infect the system through a node because others in the ledger will
    detect the attack and deny the unauthorized access. The blockchain can incorporate
    various classes of transactions or records, so its usability can extend beyond
    the initial financial scope drafted with Bitcoin cryptocurrency, to digital communications,
    product identification, to even customer claims.

  zh: 简单来说，区块链可以被视为一个由节点组成的对等网络上的分布式在线记录数据库，其中包括按时间顺序排列的一系列区块。通常用于比特币加密货币的金融交易中，点对点的区块链技术记录交易，而且没有例外，以形成在线分类帐系统。换句话说，这是一个不依赖于任何第三方的去中心化和可信任的系统。分布式节点之间的信任关系是通过数学方法和密码技术而不是半信任的中央机构建立的。这种系统的好处在于它是分布式的、基于权限的和安全的，因此被称为公共区块链网络。分布式性允许共享形式的记录保留，这意味着业务网络中的每个人都有可能验证通过区块链进行的交易，并在获得许可的情况下，他们可以追溯记录的来源。区块是不可变的，没有人拥有独立所有权，并且没有人可以删除链中交易的记录。它还通过具有追溯防篡改历史记录的能力来促进数据审计和问责制。根据实际部署情况，分类帐中的数据可以使用不同的加密技术以加密形式存储，因此保护数据隐私。此外，它提供了伪匿名属性，即用户能够保护其真实身份。此外，智能合约（即部署在分布式区块链网络上的一种自执行程序）可以用于支持不同应用场景的各种功能。例如，用户可以引入智能合约的条件和条款，只有在满足这些条件/条款时才会执行智能合约。因此，这将控制权交给了数据的所有者。此外，没有恶意软件可以通过节点感染系统，因为分类帐中的其他节点将检测到攻击并拒绝未经授权的访问。区块链可以整合各种类型的交易或记录，因此其可用性可以扩展到比特币加密货币起草的最初的金融范围之外，甚至扩展到数字通信、产品识别，甚至客户索赔。
- en: Although research and innovation can enable businesses to use blockchain in
    a broad range of applications, the use of blockchain technology for information
    security and privacy appears to be the most obvious application area. Security
    and privacy are the main concern in the network and communications-based areas
    including IoT, 5G, Edge and Cloud Computing, Software Defined Networking, Wireless
    Networks and any application that is using these paradigms such as banking systems,
    retail, logistics and public sectors. The issues related to security include confidentiality,
    privacy, access control, integrity, and availability. For example, in the cloud,
    the data of users is stored away from their site and the users do not have direct
    control over it. Strong cryptographic techniques are thus needed. The controlled
    disclosure of personal information of the users comes under the privacy requirements.
    Only the authorized entities should be provided information about the cloud users.
    Access control is used in computer security to regulate the access to critical
    or valuable resources such as data, services, computational systems, storage space,
    and so on. The rights of users to access resources are typically expressed through
    access control policies, which are evaluated at access request time against the
    current access context. If there is any change in the stored data, the owner of
    data should be able to identify this change. Also, if there is any loss or corruption
    of stored data, there should be a way to retrieve this.

    frameworks, like those of higher transaction costs, central and vulnerable regulation
    to exploitation and lack of revelation to business behavior and practices, by
    introducing a revolutionary model that utilizes blockchain to establish a decentralized

    exclusive contracts to implement the validity of the privileges of the owner and
    the proper accomplishment and settlement of the transactions, thereby mitigating
    the need for a centralized authority to ensure the accuracy of the stock exchange
    mechanism. The experimental findings convincingly demonstrate that the decentralized
    solution can provide lower transaction costs by progressively replacing brokerage
    costs and centralized officials ' commissions with mining charges which reward
