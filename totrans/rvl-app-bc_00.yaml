    decentralized storage of information, transparency, immutability and to establish
    trust in an open networked system. It is expected that the applications using
    blockchain for data security and privacy will soon replace the existing technologies
    that provide centralized storage. There are prospects of applying blockchain technology
    in many industries including digital currency, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare,
    supply chain management, banking, retail, insurance, logistics and public sectors.
    In fact, the management, access control, circulation, and sharing of any high-valued
    data should use blockchains.

    records on a peer-to-peer network that comprises a list of ordered blocks chronologically.
    Typically used in financial transactions for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the peer-to-peer
    blockchain technology records transactions without exception, in exchange to form
    an online ledger system. In other words, this is a decentralized and trustworthy
    system that is not relying on any third party. Trust relation among distributed
    nodes is established by mathematical methods and cryptography technologies instead
    of semi-trusted central institutions. The benefit of such a system is that it
    is distributed, permission-based and secure, hence it is called to be a public
    blockchain network. Distribution allows for a shared form of record keeping, meaning
    that each person within a business network has the possibility to verify the transaction
    made via the blockchain and, with permission, they can trail the record back to
    its source. The block is immutable, no one has sole ownership, and no one can
    delete the record of a transaction within the chain. It also facilitates data
    audit and accountability by having the capability to trace tamper-resistant historical
    record in the ledger. Depending on the actual deployment, data in the ledger can
    be stored in the encrypted form using different cryptographic techniques; hence,
    preserving data privacy. Further, it provides the pseudo-anonymity property, i.e.
    in the sense that the users are able to protect their real identities. Moreover,
    smart contracts (i.e. a kind of self-executing program deployed on the distributed
    blockchain network) can be used to support diverse functions for different application
    scenarios. For example, the conditions and terms of smart contract can be introduced
    by users and the smart contract will only be executed if these terms/ conditions
    are fulfilled. Hence, this hands over control to the owner of the data. Furthermore,
    no malware can infect the system through a node because others in the ledger will
    detect the attack and deny the unauthorized access. The blockchain can incorporate
    various classes of transactions or records, so its usability can extend beyond
    the initial financial scope drafted with Bitcoin cryptocurrency, to digital communications,
    product identification, to even customer claims.

    a broad range of applications, the use of blockchain technology for information
    security and privacy appears to be the most obvious application area. Security
    and privacy are the main concern in the network and communications-based areas
    including IoT, 5G, Edge and Cloud Computing, Software Defined Networking, Wireless
    Networks and any application that is using these paradigms such as banking systems,
    retail, logistics and public sectors. The issues related to security include confidentiality,
    privacy, access control, integrity, and availability. For example, in the cloud,
    the data of users is stored away from their site and the users do not have direct
    control over it. Strong cryptographic techniques are thus needed. The controlled
    disclosure of personal information of the users comes under the privacy requirements.
    Only the authorized entities should be provided information about the cloud users.
    Access control is used in computer security to regulate the access to critical
    or valuable resources such as data, services, computational systems, storage space,
    and so on. The rights of users to access resources are typically expressed through
    access control policies, which are evaluated at access request time against the
    current access context. If there is any change in the stored data, the owner of
    data should be able to identify this change. Also, if there is any loss or corruption
    of stored data, there should be a way to retrieve this.

    devices together that emerges from the novel 5G based applications. This evident
    heterogeneity invites the integration of diverse technologies such as Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs), Software Defined Networks (SDNs), Cognitive Radio Networks
    (CRNs), Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), and Opportunistic Networks (oppnets).
    However, the security and privacy are prominent conundrums seemed due to featured
    compatibility and interoperability aspects of evolving directives. Blockchain
    is the most nascent paradigm instituted to resolve the issues of security and
    privacy while retaining performance standards. In this chapter, advances of blockchain
    technology in aforesaid networks are investigated and presented as means to be
    followed as security practices for pragmatically realizing the concepts.

    for network administrators since last two decades. These attacks target the resources
    such as memory, CPU cycles and network bandwidth in order to make them unavailable
    for the benign users, thereby, violating Availability, one of the components of
    cyber security. With the existence of DDoS-as-a-service on Internet, DDoS attacks
    have now become more lucrative for the adversaries to target a potential victim.
    This chapter focuses on countering DDoS attacks using one of the latest technologies
    called blockchain. Though in inception phase, utilizing blockchain for countering
    DDoS attacks has proved to be quite promising. This chapter also compares existing
    blockchain-based defense mechanisms to counter DDoS attacks and analyze them.
    Towards the end of the work, the possible future research directions in this domain
    are presented.

    has become the game changer when we consider technologies like smart homes and
    cities; smart energy, security and surveillance and healthcare. The numerous benefits
    provided by IoT, it has become an attractive technology for users and cybercriminals.
    Cybercriminals of today have the tools and the technology to deploy millions of
    sophisticated attacks. These attacks need to be investigated; this is where digital
    forensics comes into play. However, it is not easy to conduct a forensic investigation
    in IoT systems because of the heterogeneous nature of the IoT environment. Additionally,
    forensic investigators mostly rely on evidence from service providers. A situation
    that can lead to evidence contamination. To solve this problem, this chapter proposes
    a blockchain-based IoT forensic model that prevents the admissibility of tampered
    logs into evidence.

    provides a new way of network management to the customers. SDN provides more programmable
    and flexible network services. SDN breaks the vertical integration of control
    and data planes and promotes centralized network management. This unique characteristic
    of SDN offers security features to deal with the malicious activities. However,
    architectural design of SDN makes it vulnerable to several attacks. Therefore,
    it is important to investigate the crime through various forensic techniques.
    This chapter discusses a literature study of some possible forensic techniques.
    A framework is also presented for forensic investigation of SDN environment in
    attack scenario. The proposed framework includes the collection of evidences and
    preserve them against any damage. During investigation, protection of evidences
    and chain of custody are of utmost importance to avoid misleading of the investigators.
    The safe storage strategy as well as maintaining the custody link can be achieved
    through blockchain technology.

    frameworks, like those of higher transaction costs, central and vulnerable regulation
    to exploitation and lack of revelation to business behavior and practices, by
    introducing a revolutionary model that utilizes blockchain to establish a decentralized
    stock exchange and a transparent persistent economy. The suggested model utilizes
    exclusive contracts to implement the validity of the privileges of the owner and
    the proper accomplishment and settlement of the transactions, thereby mitigating
    the need for a centralized authority to ensure the accuracy of the stock exchange
    mechanism. The experimental findings convincingly demonstrate that the decentralized
    solution can provide lower transaction costs by progressively replacing brokerage
    costs and centralized officials ' commissions with mining charges which reward
    the miners for their backbreaking work in maintaining the system and enforcing
    the laws.

    ledgers. It allows for pervasive transactions among different parties and eliminates
    the need for third-party intermediaries. Several of blockchain’s characteristics
    make it suitable for use in the agriculture sector. Some of the potential applications
    of blockchain include efficient management of the food supply chain and value-based
    payment mechanisms. The products of agriculture are usually the inputs for a multi-actor
    distributed supply chain, in which case, the consumer is usually the final client.
    The food chain involves several actors including farmers, shipping companies,
    distributors, and groceries. This makes the entire system to be distributed with
    multiple actors playing different roles throughout the chain. This currently used
    system is inefficient and unreliable in various aspects. This project aims to
    leverage Blockchain Technology to solve and address discrepancies involved in
    Food Supply Chains.

    cryptography and hash functions. Hence there is a possibility for the two users
    to choose the same private key knowingly or unknowingly. Even the intruders can
    follow the particular user’s Bitcoin transaction and they can masquerade that
    user by generating the private and public key pairs of him. If it happens the
    user may lose his transaction. Generally, Bitcoin technology uses random numbers
    from 1 to 2256\. It is a wide range; but for a greater number of users, there
    should be one another solution. There is a possibility of digital prototyping
    which leads to the loss of more accounts. This chapter provides the device-specific
    fingerprint technology known as Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to be employed
    for authentication in a blockchain-based bitcoin environment. The random unique
    response from PUF ensures correct transaction. In this chapter, a new tetrahedral
    oscillator PUF has been introduced intrinsically. All the blockchain operations
    are carried out and verified with PUF response.

    working towards a single goal. A blockchain is a computerized record that contains
    the whole history of exchanges made on the system. A multi-WSN arrangement model
    is structured. The hubs of the IoT are isolated into base stations, group heads,
    and conventional hubs as per their capacities, which encourage the administration
    and participation of the hubs. A hybrid blockchain model is proposed. To fit the
    multi-WSN arrange model better, as indicated by the various capacities and energies
    of various hubs, neighborhood blockchain and open blockchain are sent between
    group head hubs and base stations individually, and a crossbreed blockchain model
    is framed. A shared validation plot for IoT hubs is proposed. For group head hubs,
    the creators utilize the worldwide blockchain for validation, and for customary
    hubs, they utilize the nearby blockchain for confirmation. The proposal aims in
    increasing reliability by 1.17% and minimizes sinkhole attack by 2.42% compared
    to previous contribution.

    cloud and distributed environments provide sufficient storage space for the data.
    One of the challenging tasks is the privacy prevention of storage data. To overcome
    the problem of privacy the Blockchain-based database is used to store the data.
    There are various attacks like denial of service attacks (DoS), Insider attacks
    that are performed by the adversary to compromised the security of the system.
    This chapter discusses a blockchain-based database, where data are encrypted and
    stored. The Web API is used as an interface for the storage and sharing of data.
    Here, this mainly focused on the SQL injection attack which is performed by the
    adversary on Web API. To cope with this problem this chapter presents the case
    study based on the Snort and Moloch for automated detection of SQL attack, network
    analysis, and testing of the system.
