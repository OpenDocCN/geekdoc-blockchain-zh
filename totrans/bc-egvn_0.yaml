    the invention of ‘Bitcoin’ and the associated Blockchain technology can be likened
    to the ‘Big Bang’ that caused the universe to start and expand from a single point,
    13.5 billion years ago. “The Times 3/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the verge of second
    bailout for banks” — Satoshi Nakamoto - Genesis Block. 11 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto
    launched the Bitcoin network at approximately 18:15:05 UTC and the world has not
    been the same since. The Bitcoin blockchain came to life on January 3, 2009, and
    so far, more than 600,000 blocks have been mined into existence. Nakamoto’s genesis
    block is special and the hardcoded block has a few unique characteristics compared
    to the rest of the chain of blocks that followed. (source bitcoin.com) Who do
    you think is the real Satoshi Nakamoto? A question plaguing millions of people
    across the world. It is indeed a Brilliant work of A Genius digital currency specialist,
    A Genius Cryptographer, A Genius Mathematician, A Genius Computer Programmer,
    A Super Grand Master of Chess, A Genius Marketer, A Passionate Activist against
    Centralization & Excessive Regulation and Above all, someone who has no need for
    a Million Bitcoins available in his account, no need for the associated fame in
    return for the Anonymity that is needed to stand by the values of Cryptocurrency
    he invented or someone who has the capacity to command respect from, employ/ work
    with all such persons combined for a cause?! Let us examine the key suspects: Satoshi
    Nakamoto, the name used by the unknown person or people who designed bitcoin and
    created its original reference implementation. As part of the implementation,
    they also devised the first blockchain database. In the process they were the
    first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currency. Incidentally,
    Hal Finney is the neighbour of a person by name ‘SATOSHI NAKAMOTO’ who did not
    have any clue about the technology aspects of Bitcoin, when interrogated. Harold
    Finney was a cypherpunk and said: “It seemed so obvious to me: ‘Here we are faced
    with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases,
    more centralization - and David Chum offers a completely different direction to
    go in, one which puts power into the hands of individuals rather than governments
    and corporations. The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people,
    rather than to control them’. “He was an early Bitcoin user and received the first
    bitcoin transaction from Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Finney lived in the
    same town for 10 years that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto lived (Temple City, California),
    adding to speculation that he may have been Bitcoin’s creator. Finney denied that
    he was Satoshi Nakamoto. Wei Dai is a computer engineer and cypherpunk best known
    as creator of b-money and the developer of the Crypto++ library. Dai is listed
    as inventor on U.S. patents 5724279 and 6081598 which were assigned to Microsoft.  Mr.
    Dai worked in the Cryptography Research Group at Microsoft Corporation in Redmond,
    Washington. While at Microsoft, he was involved in the study, design and implementation
    of cryptosystems for specialized applications. Prior to joining Microsoft, Mr.
    Dai was a programmer with TerraSciences of Acton, Massachusetts. Mr. Dai holds
    a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Washington in computer science,
    with a minor in mathematics. “Dai has made numerous contributions to the field
    of cryptography and has identified critical Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) vulnerabilities
    affecting SSH2 and the browser exploit against SSL/TLS known as BEAST (Browser
    Exploit Against SSL/TLS). Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar[and
    cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency.
    He graduated from the University of Washington in 1989 with a degree in computer
    science. In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency
    he called “bit gold”. Bit gold was never implemented but has been called “a direct
    precursor to the Bitcoin architecture. Research by financial author Dominic Frisby
    provided circumstantial evidence but, as he admits, no proof that Satoshi is Szabo.
    Speaking on RT’s Keiser Report, he said “I’ve concluded there is only one person
    in the whole world that has the sheer breadth but also the specificity of knowledge
    and it is this chap…”. In a July 2014 email to Frisby, Szabo said “Thanks for
    letting me know. I’m afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I’m used
    to it. It seems that Satoshi Nakamoto is the name given to the Project Bitcoin
    by one of the greatest living legends of all times to come, we have in our midst
    (no guess needed!) who was instrumental in bringing together genius professionals
    who combined all the above skills narrated at the beginning, possible only by
    the collusion of all the four persons in the collage depicted at the start (one
    of them being an unsuspecting lender of the name to the project)! Bitcoin like
    the other inventions like Internet, Operating system, Search engine, Mobile computing,
    Internet of Things etc., has proved to enormously disruptive being responsible
    for an expected US$3.1 Trillion worth of business potential by 2030 as per a report
    by PCCW research based on Gartner research. Bitcoin, an outcome of a project with
    a mission to put the decision-making power back into the hands of individuals
    and secure their identities, against the powers of centralised organisations like
    Government, regulators and Business organisations, is nothing short of a work
    of a multifaceted genius that combines super skills in Programming, Cryptography,
    Mathematics, Economics, Marketing, People management, Execution excellence, strategic
    thinking, long term vision and enormous clout! Onset of the Pandemic due to nCovi19
    virus has heralded an unprecedented change in the mindsets of people to dramatically
    adopt to Technology inspired lifestyle. Earlier, it was felt as a necessity to
    meet, greet and deal with people personally and engage in official and personal
    engagements. Now there is nothing we can think that we cannot do remotely using
    digital technologies. Governments are discovering that they can dramatically improve
    the reach of and access to their services to citizens and businesses by embracing
    new technologies. Blockchain technology along with other empowering technologies
    like IOT and AI & ML powered applications is facilitating a rapid disruption across
    every aspect of our life due to its ability to securely connect vast majority
    of users simultaneously. This is offering Provenance, Authenticity and Trust to
    transactions and reducing the cost of undertaking the business. Governments in
    several countries have demonstrated the utility of Blockchain across a variety
    of e-governance applications. As Blockchain paradigm emerged out of the shadow
    of the negative impact of permissionless cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, that have
    been illegally exploited to channelize and transfer unaccounted money across borders,
    it is time to look at the various possibilities that exist for this amazing enabler
    of secured automation at scale. In this book we would like to look at the various
    applications of Blockchain and explore the approaches to implementation in a Government
    context.Prologue We are increasingly faced with several new technologies like
    IOT, AI & Analytics, Machine learning, 3D printing, AR/VR, Robotics, Drones making
    inroads into several areas of our corporate & personal lives. All these technologies
    are offering an unprecedented level of automation that is augmenting our performance
    & lifestyles as well. As these technologies are leveraging the centralised approach
    of aggregation & economies of scale to facilitate efficiencies that provide a
    high level of training data, these are also increasingly becoming vulnerable to
    sophisticated cyber-attacks from actors searching for lucrative targets, to hold
    them at ransom. Given this, How are we supposed to safeguard burgeoning investments
    into cutting-edge intelligent analytics driven investments of Industry 4.0? Enters
    Blockchain with its potential of decentralisation and cryptographically protected
    and distributed ledgers that provide a mechanism to nullify the action Cybercriminals
    and their attacks. By eliminating Single points of failure that are resident in
    Centralised era, Blockchain seems to be the preferred technology that the world
    is looking for! What then is this Blockchain? Let us demystify it! First introduced
    to the world as Bitcoin, A Cryptocurrency by a fictitious entity with name – Satoshi
    Nakamoto, in the year 2008 through a whiter paper Peer to Peer Electronic Cash
    System. Blockchain the underlying technology that pioneered Bitcoin and resultant
    innovations in Global Payments industry has made its impact much beyond the core
    finance domain it transformed initially. Blockchain is now considered, a special
    type of distributed ledger that records peer to peer transactions executed through
    a new generation of applications called Smart contracts, in a safe and secure
    manner, by using advanced Cryptography protocols that offer security, transparency
    & tamper resistance properties to the transactions. In the generation of artificial
    intelligence led analytics that are empowering centralised organisations by offering
    new tools to manipulate demand, there has been off late a huge inclination to
    counter these forces & patronise decentralised systems that put the power back
    into the hands of individual customers. The era of open-source technologies &
    ‘Pay as you go’ models are fuelling proliferation of such decentralised platforms,
    aka blockchain based systems that are empowering the citizens and organisations
    across the world with their ‘Cooperative style’ approach. The disintermediation
    of Social media platforms and Ecommerce marketplaces posing a serious threat to
    the existence of global giants like Amazon, Uber, Facebook etc., seems to be round
    the corner, thanks to Blockchain! The fake products menace in global Pharmaceuticals,
    Auto Parts, Luxurious and high-quality exported goods is fuelling the need for
    tamper free and on-demand ‘Authentication‘ solutions that enable tracing and tracking
    goods from Source to Consumption, Farm to Store, Farm to Fork is being facilitated
    by Enterprise Blockchain applications. This has led to further applications in
    marine products, farm and other food products that can be tracked throughout supply
    chains across multiple enterprises by Blockchain platforms, that are making these
    look simple by abstracting several components through sophisticated smart contracts
    & ingeniously implemented consensus protocols. Blockchain is now seen as the saviour
    of over 1.2 lakh citizens across Africa alone protecting them from spurious drugs
    and saving over 77 Billion US Dollars annually in US Health care industry. No
    wonder, food giants like Walmart have implemented Food Trust to establish authenticity
    of products sold through their stores. The mistrust laden in academic certificates,
    land records, licenses and incorrect health records for insurance claims has not
    been conclusively addressed till the advent of Blockchain applications. KYC documents,
    Citizen & Customer identity records and birth, academic, certificates, medical
    records, property ownership, marriage certificates, death certificates are now
    deemed to be immutably and permanently recorded on Blockchain, eliminating the
    need to carry paper-based records whose authenticity is doubtful. Estonia, Switzerland,
    Singapore are embracing Blockchain as front runners and economically aspirational
    and futuristic hungry nations like UAE are embracing ‘Blockchain paradigm’ by
    all means and are planning to go paperless soon. With Permanence (Immutability
    of records), Authenticity (Provenance & proof of ownership) & Trust (Trust guaranteed
    by disintermediating centralized organisations, eliminating middlemen through
    smart contracts), Blockchain seems to be quintessential for the much-needed competitive
    advantage in ‘increasingly Automated’ world in the era of ‘Innoruption’ (Innovation
    led disruption)! As Governments across the world start evaluating Blockchain closely,
    even as Blockchain steps out of close linkage and correlation to ‘Bitcoin’, there
    are a lot of questions as to how to design, implement and derive benefits of Blockchain
    to the fullest. There is a requirement to educate members of the eco-system including
    all those who are responsible for its adoption in the Government and Public Sector. Start-ups
    work hard to evolve new solutions that challenge “status quo’ and propel the world
    forward with new products, technologies, platforms, applications and services. Most
    of the time, the inspiration to fund a new venture springs out of a problem, suffering
    that promoters or their near and dear experience and endure. These setbacks propel
    them to start a new venture and come out with a viable solution. They undergo
    a lot of struggles, undertake a lot of sacrifices before coming up with solutions. This
    shows that Start-ups are masters at Identifying problems, examining options to
    solve problems, prioritising them and finally orchestrating a solution that scales
    up in the long run in a viable manner. This is also the essence of design thinking
    that focuses on zeroing on customer problems that need to be solved., Blockchain,
    one of the latest in the disruptive technologies is seeing a surge in adoption
    owing to adoption by Start-ups.. There is a need to come out with a systemic thinking
    approach to leverage this new paradigm. Hence, let us delve into design thinking
    approach to solve the problems using Blockchain. In this book, we aim to take
    a look at the Global adoption and implementation aspects & their challenges. This
    book will be very useful to Blockchain Subject Matter Experts, Consultants, CXOs
    and Government officials.Downloading the coloured images: Please follow the link

    Technology has proved its utility beyond its original discovered use case as a
    unit of decentralised, distributed and Permission less crypto currency and is
    not being widely looked upon as a foundational technology that is disrupting a
    number of industries with a variety of use cases for government and enterprises.
    With its promise of acting as Trusted Third Party governed by automated programs
    driven by mathematical algorithms, Blockchain is promising to eliminate expensive
    non-value adding middlemen who add to a number of leakages of money and a variety
    of other resources that add significantly to costs. As an inter-enterprise collaborative
    platform, it is promising to take economies of scale to a totally different scale,
    benefiting the entire participating eco-system. The technology has the potential
    to significantly benefit the humanity by dramatically lowering costs and improving
    trust in transactions through built in transparency aided by almost immutable
    & tamper-evident transactions. In this chapter, we shall look at Blockchain Technology
    fundamentals and a variety of prominent use cases across different domain, in
    different countries and also look at a number of Consortiums implementing Blockchain
    solutions. ORIGIN & EVOLUTION OF Blockchain & How it all started Bitcoin protocol
    that was launched on January 3rd, 2009, the first known application of the Blockchain
    technology paradigm, reliably provided a solution for achieving such a consensus
    in distributed systems that create and transact value over the internet without
    fear of ‘Double-spending.’ This problem was formulated into a story called ‘Byzantine
    General’s Problem’ where a group of nine generals decided to attack a fort they
    were surrounding, subject to the majority’s decision despite being handicapped
    by improper communication facilities. A 25-year wait after the problem’s formulation,
    Bitcoin successfully demonstrated a solution for the computer systems to achieve
    Byzantine tolerance even in face of a sizable number of adversaries and adverse
    conditions. There are different types of consensus mechanisms like POW (Proof-of-Work),
    POS (Proof of Stake), DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake), PoET (Proof of Elapsed
    time), PBFT (Proof of Byzantine Tolerance), RBFT, RAFT, N2N and many more. A detailed
    discussion on these various consensus mechanisms is out of the scope of this manuscript
    and several white papers are available for understanding and evaluating the same. Bitcoin,
    the first implementation of the Blockchain paradigm Blockchain technology was
    demonstrated successfully through its first use case, ‘Bitcoin.’ Bitcoin Blockchain
    is a living example to show that this often doubted and misunderstood technology
    is a new paradigm that has come to stay with us for a very long term. Bitcoin
    is the first implementation of Blockchain technology consisting of six primary
    elements:  An updated Distributed ledger replicated across all the peers undertaking
    transactions through the platform, consisting of the updated status of Unspent
    Outputs (UTXO) in chronological order. A network of nodes undertaking to verify
    and propagate the transactions generated by the participants. A group of miners
    dispersed across the world to mine the transactions to ensure the authenticity
    of the same, maintaining the integrity of the Blockchain for all times to come,
    using an automated execution of the protocol defined by the consensus algorithm
    called ‘Proof-of Work.’ ‘Proof-of-Work’ represents the amount of work that the
    miners undertake by utilizing their computing power and electricity spent, to
    be eligible for block rewards in the form of newly mined coins as per a predefined
    formula. ![](image-jnjzohwc.jpg) Figure 1.1: Sample Blockchain Network Blockchain
    wallets used by the participants to initiate transactions and store the value
    in the form of UTXOs or unspent transaction outputs measured in the number of
    Bitcoins. The value that is exchanged across the platform, namely the ‘Bitcoin’
    or its fraction, which is treated as a cryptocurrency with all the properties
    that we associate with the fiat currency in the real world, except the unitized
    physical representation and regulatory approvals. Exchanges that facilitate buying
    and selling of cryptocurrencies and derived products known as tokens among themselves
    using wallets and conversion of the same into fiat currencies in a dynamic manner. Bitcoin
    has proved that billions of dollars’ worth of value can be exchanged across the
    world from one person to another unknown person, without the need of a trusted
    central party, a bank or Government in this case. As on 1st February 2021, over
    18 million Bitcoins with an approximate total value of over 500 billion US Dollar
    at a unit price of over 30000 US Dollars are in circulation. The success of Bitcoin
    led to the launch of several variations of alternate Blockchains for a variety
    of purposes. The majority of them are cryptocurrencies with different properties
    in terms of privacy, speed of execution, consensus mechanism for transaction validation,
    the most prominent variation was proposed in the form of the Ethereum Blockchain
    platform by Vitalik Buterin and his team at Ethereum foundation which we shall
    discuss a little later. ![](image-potfxph0.jpg) Figure 1.2: How Does Bitcoin Work Over
    the years, the cost of infrastructure in the form of storage space and processing
    power required for IT applications has come down substantially. The availability
    of high-quality Cloud service providers has reduced the need for investments in
    high cost on premise infrastructure. Approaches like ‘Open-source technologies,
    decentralized methodologies’ and ‘Pay-as-you-go-for-services consumed’ are combining
    to facilitate the employment of cutting-edge technology powered infrastructure
    to find new solutions to our problems, rather cheaply. Messaging Protocols, Event-driven
    communication and record updation, API (Application Programming Interfaces) are
    facilitating collaboration between applications across multiple on-Premise and
    Cloud-based applications acting together seamlessly. IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon
    and many leading organizations are offering high-end secure IT applications including
    Blockchain as a service that can facilitate the large-scale implementation of
    automation enabling technologies in a convenient and cost-effective manner. What
    is Blockchain? Blockchain is an augmented Peer to Peer Distributed Ledger Technology
    employing advanced cryptography to secure identities of participants in the network
    undertaking timestamped, immutable transactions with decentralised processing
    to exchange data & change ownership of assets using cutting edge technology powered
    applications also known as Smart contracts running inside the system providing
    Transparency, Security, Tamper resistance, Auditability and enhanced Trust through
    system acting as Trusted Third Party in Triple entry accounting. ![](image-qh4gp9k0.jpg) Figure
    1.3: Decentralized Blockchain Network as TTP (Trusted Third Party) Blockchain:
    An Augmented Distributed Ledger Technology Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger
    that uses peer to peer consensus within a Decentralized Network to validate transactions
    and a hashing algorithm to cryptographically link them in a Chronological chain
    of records.  Copies of ledger are shared across computers known as ‘Nodes in the
    network’ Computerised record of historical transactions chronologically ordered. Shares
    resources directly between nodes bypassing third part network with specialized
    communication protocols. Every transaction must be approved (or rejected) by Consensus
    mechanisms (Ex: POW, POA, POS, DPOS, PBFT, RBFT, Raft etc.) Hosted by many nodes
    simultaneously controlled by no single entity. Data is accessible by anyone within
    the network. Public Permissionless networks like Bitcoin & Ethereum, Permissioned
    networks like Hyperledger, R3 Corda, Quorum Transactions may include moving currency,
    updating a standard enterprise records, transferring ownership of an asset etc. Converting
    transaction data to a fixed length string of numbers and letters that cannot be
    reverse engineered (ex: SHA 256). The hashing process of a new block includes
    meta data from the previous block’s hash output. The link makes the chain immutable. A
    full immutable time-ordered history of transactions approved by the network. Resilient
    Data Structures of Blockchain We have seen that in the traditional approach, the
    participants in a typical business scenario pretty much operate in silos and all
    the parties are connected to the centralized big marketplace or the dominant player
    who connects the buyers and sellers or provides the services to the clients globally. Instead,
    Blockchain presents an inter-enterprise scenario that offers a ‘Single Source
    of Truth’ where all the peers are connected to every other peer with a possibility
    to conduct peer-to-peer transactions as per business logic codified in the form
    of Smart Contracts. Even the dominant player, though while being the facilitator
    could still be a player whose returns depend on the quantity and quality of the
    business dealings happening on the network. The Single Point of Failure has always
    been the bane of most of the centralized organizations which maintain their databases
    under a single command, control and administration. This is the weakness most
    often exploited by the Ransomware virus creators who were behind some of the most
    lethal attacks on global organizations by unleashing the WannaCry virus. While
    distribution and shared database also help in nonrepudiation by the parties undertaking
    transaction, the ability to reconstruct the database from other members of the
    network eliminates the risk of the SPOF from this very route, thus blunting the
    weapons of the cybercriminals. This minimizes the risk by tilting the RRR (Risk-Reward-Ratio)
    away from the investors of these crooked instruments. Thus, Blockchain is seen
    as the vehicle for safe and secure automation at scale. Traditionally we are used
    to centralised databases for storing data which respect the CRUD methods for manipulating
    data, namely Create, Update, Update and Delete. We also come across replicated
    data bases under the command and control of the same IT Administrator’s control.
    Blockchain, a programmable database differs from the traditional databases in
    a number of ways, as captured in the following figure. ![](image-cf1jvcmj.jpg) Figure
    1.4: Blockchain & its connection with Databases & Distributed Ledger Tech As seen
    in the above diagram, Blockchains can be classified as follows:  Permissioned:
    If the membership and the validator pool is restricted and must be approved by
    an admin authority like in the case of Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, Quorum etc.
    In a Permissioned Blockchain, ability to conduct transactions or write data is
    restricted as per access control rights Permissionless: If the membership and
    the validator pool is not controlled and accessible with equal opportunity to
    anyone like in the case of public Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms In case the data
    stored on the Blockchain is accessible for viewing to anyone without restrictions,
    then it is considered a Public Blockchain and if the access is strictly restricted
    and is kept confidential to a selected group of participants, then it is considered
    Private Blockchain. If a Blockchain is set up and implemented by a dominant player
    who controls the access and validation, it is termed Private Permissioned and
    in case a group of participants work together then it is termed a Consortium Blockchain
    or Federated In general, Blockchain databases can be considered SALT databases
    as per the context may be. In the context of Permissioned Blockchain systems,
    SALT may be described as Sequenced (timestamped), Agreed (decided in a manner
    agreeable to the participants as per an approved program), Ledgered (maintained
    in a database of key-value pairs reflecting the state of ownership of assets and
    Tamper resistant (almost impossible to change the order of the records committed). ![](image-pr1g5rqf.jpg) Figure
    1.5: An integrated representation of Components of Blockchain eco-system Components
    of Blockchain Blockchain Combines Encryption, Encoding, Hashing, PKI, Timestamps,
    DSA and Broadcast for the Internet of Value by bringing Privacy, Permission, Password
    management within the reach of an individual peer and frees him/her from the dependence
    on the Trust Anchors who have now grown unduly large leading to a centralized
    internet Blockchain converts the traditional internet infrastructure as we know
    through its TCP/IP protocol from the Internet of Information to the Internet of
    Value, by acting as a Trusted Third Party to any peer to peer interactions. The
    features of Blockchain that facilitate this are shown in the following figure. ![](image-bz4jq30i.jpg) Figure
    1.6: How Blockchain changes the game for the Digital Era Participants Blockchain
    combines the cryptographic and programmatic paradigms like encryption, encoding
    and hashing in a unique manner to achieve amazing benefits offering a new paradigm
    of trusted disintermediated transactions. ![](image-yxawvsan.jpg) Figure 1.7:
    Encryption – Encoding – Hashing  Hash function: A hash function produces a unique
    fixed length output for a corresponding input of any size (like a thumb impression
    of a human being), which cannot be replicated. Hash of any information is treated
    as the unique and indisputable representation of the information. Hashes form
    the heart of Blockchain as the blocks are represented by the hash of the information
    and are chained together as a linked list of chronologically mined and validated
    blocks. Merkle root (Root of roots): While a hash is a unique number derived out
    of the base number, the Merkle root is derived from hashing pairs of transactions
    together until only one element is left. Since the hash was unique, a change in
    any transaction would result in a change in the Merkle root, which would be easily
    caught. Public-Key Infrastructure: To facilitate secure electronic transmission
    of information and undertake ultra-safe transactions, Blockchain employs several
    cryptographic applications. PKI or Public-Key Infrastructure is a set of technological
    procedures used to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital
    certificates. PKI is used to authenticate participating parties using public keys
    and corresponding private keys connected to each other through complex algorithmic
    relations, requiring rigorous proofs to confirm identities for facilitating information
    exchange. PKI uses X.509 certificates to identify the owners of public keys.  Private
    key and Public-Key: The Private Key and Public-Key pair is (Private key being
    the secret password and Public key being the corresponding username known to all)
    used to encrypt information using mathematical algorithms, rendering decryption
    virtually impossible without these keys. Computationally, it is similar to the
    factoring of prime numbers, which is a simple, mathematical procedure. However,
    decomposing the result is difficult without prior knowledge of its factors. PKI
    systems normally use RSA algorithms for linking public keys and private keys.
    RSA (Revest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is
    widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption
    key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret
    (private). Blockchain systems use Elliptical curve cryptography to issue secure
    Public-key Private key pairs. The messages are encrypted by a digital signature
    algorithm namely, ECDSA that ensures that only authorized owners of targeted messages
    can securely decrypt the messages. Digital Signatures: Digital signatures are
    a unique aspect of Blockchain transactions and provide a layer of security to
    carry out and validate genuine transactions. A digital signature is a mathematical
    scheme to present the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital
    signature gives the recipient reason to believe that the message was created by
    a known sender (authenticated by verifying against the public key of the sender),
    and the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation by signing
    with his/her unique Private key), or that the message was not altered in transit. X.509
    Certificates: In Permissioned Blockchains like R3 Corda or Hyperledger Fabric,
    the participating members are provided X.509 certificates by the administration
    Certificate authority for identification by the network. An X. 509 certificate
    is a digital certificate that uses the widely accepted international X. 509 public
    key infrastructure (PKI) standard to verify that a public key belongs to the user,
    computer or service identity contained within the certificate. ![](image-wp7q0l4t.jpg) Figure
    1.8: X.509 Certificates for certifying identities in permissioned scenarios Consensus
    Mechanisms (POW, POS, DPOS, PBFT, etc.): The mechanism by which members come to
    an agreement about the authenticity of a transaction is referred to as the ‘Consensus
    Mechanism.’ Consensus formation ensures the involvement of multiple validators
    in a systematic and predetermined manner, ensuring decentralization and objectivity
    of decision making. It ensures implementation of the key features of the Blockchain
    platform like increased trust, immutability of the transactions, and maintenance
    of the integrity of the platform. The consensus mechanism is the soul of the Blockchain
    platform and has to help members in reaching the right decision all the time.
    The sanctity of the Blockchain application depends on the strength and reliability
    of the consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism followed by Bitcoin and the
    earlier version of the public Ethereum client is known as ‘Proof-of-Work (POW)’
    where miners or validators compete with each other and burn valuable resources
    like computing power and enormous amounts of electricity to guess the right Nonce
    (number used only once) and create a targeted hash to win the race to create a
    block. Proof-of-Work—followed by Bitcoin Blockchain and some versions of Ethereum
    Blockchain—consumes a huge amount of resources to arrive at a deterministic consensus.
    The Ethereum platform will soon shift to a ‘Proof of Stake’ based consensus, which
    involves negligible energy consumption. Some new-generation public platforms use
    variations of ‘POW’ and ‘POS’-based consensus algorithms like PoET (Proof of Elapsed
    Time) and DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) to minimize resource utilization and
    wastage. Enterprise Blockchains use energy-efficient algorithms like ‘Proof of
    Authority’ (POA), Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant’ (PBFT), ‘Node to Node’ (N2N)
    and their variations to arrive at a deterministic consensus. As it can be seen,
    the discovery of the Blockchain paradigm has been achieved by an ingenious combination
    of the various simple tools and techniques that have been in vogue for decades.
    Let us now define Blockchain with our understanding of the various components,
    features and benefits offered by this unique technology. Thus, many permutations
    & combinations are possible depending on the ability to read, write or vote on
    the transactions. In the case of Governments, we come across Public Permissioned
    Blockchains which are restricted for writing and maintaining, but the data could
    be accessed by all the citizens for verification like in the case of certain type
    of certificates or ownership records. The important feature of this Blockchain
    approach is the ‘decentralized’ approach where the decision regarding the correctness
    of the transactions is taken without recourse to an individual entity’s authority
    and muscle power. The transactions with due approvals and authorizations representing
    the real-life scenario are sent to a pool of network managers, who can then collectively
    follow a designated approach and vote on the transactions to be included in the
    approved chain of events that influence the records and ledgers permanently. The
    decentralized pool of miners is referred differently in different Blockchain systems
    and serves to increase the uptime of the network manifold while minimizing the
    risk associated with a centralized approach. While in Permissionless Blockchains
    we have mining pools or set of validators, on Permissioned Blockchains for enterprise
    applications, they operate as a set of Orderers (Hyperledger Fabric), Notaries
    (R3 Corda), Validators (Hyperledger Sawtooth, Indy) and the like.CHAPTER 2 Blockchain
    Platforms for Real life Applications Ethereum which was launched after Bitcoin
    with improvisations, allowed businesses to create decentralized versions of real-life
    applications that we see in the day-to-day world through the implementation of
    ‘Smart Contracts’ which are programs created to replicate the business agreements
    into applications that can be run on Blockchain databases. A “smart contract”
    is simply a piece of code that is running on Ethereum. It is called a “contract”
    because code that runs on Ethereum can control valuable things like ETH (ether
    – native crypto currency on Ethereum Public network) or other digital assets.
    Smart. Contracts abstract real-life business agreements into applications on a
    decentralised network of computers running Ethereum nodes in the context of EVM
    (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The EVM runs as a local instance on every Ethereum
    node, but because all instances of the EVM operate on the same initial state and
    produce the same final state, the system as a whole operates as a single “world
    computer.” EVM is considered Turing complete which means it can solve any reasonable
    complex computational problem. One technically implements logic in say Python
    and translate to Solidity the Smart contract programming language to implement
    sophisticated logic. In the case of Permissionless Blockchains like Ethereum,
    the transactions forwarded by clients are validated by a pool of miners who win
    the opportunity to create a block of valid transactions that is then appended
    to the Blockchain, eventually updated by all the nodes of the platform. Thus,
    the approved transaction becomes a part of everyone’s ledger thus becoming immutable
    and tamper resistant. ![](image-s46qkbmk.jpg) Figure 2.1: Components of Ethereum
    Permissionless Network There are various client software that have been created
    for this platform. It does not have high data storage capabilities. Storing and
    retrieval of complex data have limitations. To overcome this, we need to store
    the data off chain and manage them through Blockchain compatible data bases and
    technologies. IPFS (Inter planetary File server) and Swarm are two protocols that
    help us in managing large amounts of data off the chain in a way, referenceable
    across the Ethereum network in a decentralized manner. IPFS We can now address
    large amounts of data with IPFS, and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links
    into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures your content, without
    having to put the data on the chain itself. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS)
    is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing
    devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS. Each file and the blocks
    within it are given a unique fingerprint called a cryptographic hash. ![](image-sg8r1fnx.jpg) Figure
    2.2: IPFS leveraging Merkle tree data structures When looking up files, you’re
    asking the network to find nodes storing the content behind a unique hash. By
    inserting the hash of the data pointing to the file on the nodes, instead of large
    files through the Smart contract, we can dramatically enhance the capability of
    the Blockchain platform at a very nominal cost. How do the files located in IPFS
    in the contract owner’s computer interact with the Ethereum network? The developer
    of the smart contract will allow the files of its users to be stored in IPFS enabled
    system. The metadata of the files are stored across all the nodes in the blockchain.
    When a user queries for the metadata, the blockchain returns the corresponding
    files required by querying the same by referencing the corresponding IPFS hash
    link embedded in the smart contract. ![](image-px20dmfd.jpg) Figure 2.3: Storing
    Off-chain Files using IPFS The user will interface with Blockchain through a web
    interface, interacting with the Blockchain through an API. ![](image-r2mtmu30.jpg) Figure
    2.4: IPFS integration for storing large volumes of off chain data referenced on
    Blockchain by hash. Ethereum also supports SWARM, a decentralized file system
    platform similar to IPFS, which comes integrated with the Blockchain platform
    to manage large files off its main chain. While it is similar to IPFS in many
    ways, transactions involving storing files in Swarm need to be paid in Ether thus
    increasing the cost of participation marginally.  Swarm is a distributed storage
    platform and content distribution service. It is a native base layer service of
    the Ethereum web 3 stacks. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a sufficiently
    decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum’s public record, in particular to
    store and distribute Dapp code and data as well as block chain data. From an economic
    point of view, it allows participants to efficiently pool their storage and bandwidth
    resources to provide the aforementioned services to all participants. From the
    end user’s perspective, Swarm is not that different from WWW, except that uploads
    are not to a specific server. The objective is peer-to-peer storage and providing
    a solution that is DDOS-resistant with zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant
    as well as self-sustaining. Self-sustenance is achieved by a built-in incentive
    system which uses peer to peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.
    Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer
    of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution,
    service payments and content availability insurance. Enterprise Blockchain platforms
    like Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, etc., were developed as variations of the Ethereum
    platform while enterprise applications like Multichain and R3 Corda took inspiration
    from the architecture and other elements of Bitcoin Blockchain. Hyperledger Fabric
    works on the concept of Channel, which is a private network within the quorum
    of all the nodes on the system, that share a business logic and are parties to
    transactions as per an approved smart contract also called a Chain code. The data
    is shared amongst the participants as per access control and privacy requirements
    to maintain confidentiality unlike in the case of Ethereum which broadcasts the
    information on the ledger to all the participants. Transaction flow in typical
    enterprise Blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric is described in the following figure: ![](image-1qteh1c0.jpg) Figure
    2.5: A typical transaction flow in a Permissioned Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric
    Network’s Channel Step 0: The Certificate authorities in the respective organisations
    provide the cryptographic identities to the respective peers and the same information
    is disseminated to all the other counterparties involved in transactions with
    the respective peers. Step 1: Client sends Transaction Proposal to Endorsing peers
    (who must approve as per Business logic encoded in the channel’s Chaincode). Step
    2: Endorsing peers attest the transaction and send back to Client with their digital
    signatures Step 3: Clients sends the fully approved transactions along with the
    endorsers’ signatures to Orderer. Step 4: Orderer verifies the transaction’s validity
    and includes the same in a block along with the time stamp. As per the block interval/
    block size limit encoded, Orderer creates a block of valid transactions and sends
    the read/write sets to respective organisation’s Leader Peers. Step 5: Leader
    Peer distributes the blocks to all the peers in the organisation who are the channel
    members Step 6: The validating peers upon receipt of the blocks, update their
    respective ledgers with valid approved transactions consistent with their current
    state. Step 7: Transactions not consistent with the current state of the respective
    member ledgers are nullified but continue to be a part of the Blockchain ledger
    Distributed Ledger Platforms like R3 Corda do not work on the concept of Blockchain. They
    follow the Triple entry accounting concept, where a Notary node acts as a validator
    to guarantee transactions between counterparties, as per pre-configured business
    logic. Notary checks and ensures the validity of the transaction and prevents
    double spend. ![](image-v1fzx8cg.jpg) Figure 2.6: Corda Transaction flows updating
    the Ledger STELLAR Stellar is an open-source protocol for exchanging money backed
    by Non-profit Stellar foundation. Stellar allows for transfer of value across
    the world over internet through servers that run software implementation of the
    protocol, forming a global value exchange network. Each server stores a record
    of all “accounts” on the network in a “ledger”. The transactions submitted through
    the clients are approving as per a consensus protocol and the ledgers are synchronised
    every 3-4 seconds. Stellar offers Smart contract functionality with applications
    written in JavaScript, Java and Go. It uses a proprietary consensus mechanism
    SCP that is a significant improvement over Proof of Work that result in no cost
    of mining and high throughput of 1000 transactions per second with an average
    block time of 3.5 seconds. Stellar ideally suited for financial transactions that
    involve transfer of money across countries. Non-profit and microfinance companies
    use Stellar to move funds across the word. Crowd funding through ICO linked to
    its currency, XLM is one of the prominent use cases of stellar protocol. In 2018,
    Stellar announced their affiliation with Key base to eliminate the need of extended
    cryptographic addresses for international transactions. NEM Malaysia based NEM,
    uses a cryptocurrency XEM as a native token. It uses a unique Consensus mechanism
    called POI (Proof of importance) that gives weightage to the miners in proportion
    to the number of tokens held in conjunction with the average duration of holding.
    Their miners who hold over 10000 tokens have a chance of earning additional rewards. NEM
    is built from scratch as a powerful and streamlined platform for application developers
    of all kinds, not just as a digital currency. Using NEM in your application is
    as simple as making RESTful JSON API calls allowing you to configure your own
    “Smart Assets” and make use of NEM’s powerful blockchain platform as you are fast,
    secure and scalable solution. Configured for your use, NEM is suitable for an
    amazing variety of solution classes, such as direct public transactions via streamlined
    smartphone app, efficient cloud services that connect client or web applications. NEM
    offers an enterprise version useful for extensive enterprise level use cases with
    secure functionality like, Digital identity, Crowd funding, Token launch through
    ICOs, Educational records management system etc. NEM offers additional security
    for users through multi-signature wallet implementation. NEM smart contracts can
    be coded in Java. NEM offers customized templates that ease the task of development
    of smart contracts. NEO Neo is a China based Public Blockchain platform that offers
    a number of advantages over Ethereum. Neo claims to combine the power of Blockchain
    technology and uniquely created high security identities of users to create smart
    assets than can be operated upon by Smart contracts for a new generation of transactional
    activities. Digital assets are programmable assets that exist in the form of electronic
    data. The use of blockchain technology to realize asset digitization has features
    such as decentralization, mediation, trust less, traceability, and high transparency.
    NEO supports multiple digital assets at the bottom level. Users can register assets
    on NEO, freely trade and transfer, and resolve the mapping relationship with physical
    assets through digital identities. The assets registered by users through a compliant
    digital identity are protected by law. Digital identity refers to the identity
    information of individuals, organizations, and things that exist in the form of
    electronic data. The current mature digital identity system is based on the PKI’s
    X.509 standard. In NEO, we will implement a set of X.509-compliant digital identity
    standards. This set of digital identity standards, in addition to the X.509-compliant
    hierarchical certificate issuance model, will also support the Web of Trust peer-to-peer
    certificate issuance model. The biggest feature of the NeoContract smart contract
    system is the seamless integration with the existing developer ecosystem. Developers
    can use C#, Java, and other mainstream programming languages to develop, debug,
    and compile smart contracts in familiar IDE environments (Visual Studio, Eclipse,
    etc.) without learning a new programming language. NEO’s universal lightweight
    virtual machine NeoVM is highly deterministic, highly concurrent, and highly scalable.
    The NeoContract smart contract system enables millions of developers worldwide
    to quickly develop smart contracts. NeoContract will have a separate white paper
    describing the implementation details. CARDANO (ADA) Originally known as the Ethereum
    of Japan, ADA offers a number of versatile features to its platform adaptors.
    Founded by an Ethereum developer, Charles Hoskinson, ADA is supposed to possess
    advanced quantum resistant features against malware attacks. The Blockchain platform
    offers smart contract functionality as well as a strong Digital identity system
    of regulatory standards. Smart contracts on Cardano are programmed in Haskell
    and it uses Aurobro’s Proof of stake consensus algorithm with a high resistance
    or DDOS attacks due to higher transaction fees with no remuneration for mining. Using
    an approach known as side chains, Cardano SL, a general-purpose cryptocurrency
    enables domain specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way,
    any innovation developed via domain specific cryptocurrency can have participants
    who hold value in a general-purpose cryptocurrency. Examples of such applications
    are identity management, gaming and gambling, and verifiable computations. The
    unique feature of Cardano is its wallet which allows interoperability between
    a variety of cryptocurrencies and in future aims to offer interoperability with
    fiat currencies making it easy for any entrepreneur in the world to launch their
    DAO even if the cryptocurrency is not allowed in their region by the respective
    governments. There are many more such platforms and new age platforms incorporate
    advanced & customized consensus and privacy standards & follow zero knowledge
    proof-based protocols while also addressing the concerns of scalability, high
    throughput, interoperability an integration. The whitepapers and concept papers
    on the respective topics need to be kept in sight on a dynamic basis. BLOCKCHAIN

    a readymade inter-enterprise platform that abstracts several complexities that
    would otherwise be very complex and tedious IT applications to create between
    multiple non-trusting parties to interact with each other. By mediating in an
    automated fashion between non-trusting parties it allows competitors to collaborate
    and cooperate in a coordinated manner through seamless communication over a distributed
    system. It offers varying degrees of centralisation depending on the type of governing
    council that could range from a centralised body like Government that empowers
    a number of other connected and regulatory body members to authorise & facilitate
    transactions on one end and on the other, to a completely decentralised administration
    like in the case of Public permissionless Blockchain platform like Bitcoin, Ethereum
    and the like. It can be observed that the most difficult aspect of implementing
    Blockchain projects is to get different parties to agree upon a common approach
    to solving problems collaboratively. The projects initially start with a single
    ownership and very few nodes and after successful conclusion of the Proof of concept
    of the benefits, tend to scale up fast into multiple nodes with an increased participation
    amongst the eco-system players. The Trusted Third-party approach facilitated by
    the Blockchain is captured in the following figure. ![](image-wfenlj85.jpg) Figure
    3.1: Blockchain as Decentralised Trusted Third Party among transacting participants The
    challenges to governance dramatically increase even as the benefits increase dramatically
    due to network effect due to economies of scale. ![](image-2e2yufvv.jpg) Figure
    3.2: Blockchain Platform Benefits versus Complexity What are the returns for the
    Blockchain infrastructure provider? The users of the platform have a lot to gain
    in the form of increased efficiencies, better services provided to their customers
    and a drastic reduction in third party risk, increased cybersecurity and resilience
    and reduction in operational costs owing to digitization. For this, they will
    pay a fee to the administrating organization of the Blockchain platform as per
    an agreed pay-per-usage model thus resulting in a win-win scenario. In the case
    of Permissionless Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, heavy costs are incurred
    by the maintainers of the consensus mechanism who offer the TTP benefits to the
    participants. For this, the miners are rewarded by a combination of currency minted
    by the network and the transaction fees paid by the participants. While in the
    case of Enterprise Blockchains the participants’ identities are fully disclosed
    and verified for compliance with the regulatory authorities, in the case of Permissionless
    Blockchains, there is a real possibility of ill-intentioned and malicious participants
    to take over the network or push illegal transactions leading to ‘Double-spending.’
    While this is a routine issue with smaller sized Permissionless platforms, in
    the case of large platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the network pushes the
    miners to spend a high amount of resources like computer processing power and
    electricity to validate their transactions. This leads to a negative ROI (Return
    on Investment) for malicious participants making it non-remunerative to attack
    the system. However, the fall-out of this is that the Permissionless Blockchain
    platforms consume disproportionately high resources that could one day pose a
    threat to environmental sustainability. There is an increasing tendency to innovate
    on different types of resource-efficient consensus algorithms for use by Permissionless
    Blockchain platforms (example: DPOS, Tendermint, Proof of Stake, Proof of Elapsed
    Time, etc.), which could be explored in detail by technically minded professionals. Some
    of the key applications for Blockchain that can dramatically improve the quality
    of governance and facilitate trust, transparency and increase citizen satisfaction
    is summarised below:  Durable Record keeping: Example: Health records, Educational
    records, Municipal Records Chain of Custody: Provenance, Authenticity, Trust based
    Track and Trace-Example, Pharma, food, Land records, Bonds etc. Multiple Agency
    Collaboration: Example: Income tax, Market places, Auctions, Procurement, Project
    Management Trusted high value Transactions: Example: Insurance, Letter of credit,
    Benefit distribution, Loan disbursement Increase transparency: Evidence recording,
    Certificate & License issues, Identity verification Eliminate middlemen to save
    time & cost: Example: Market place, Cross Border currency transfer Cyber Security:
    Example: IoT, Autonomous cars, Drones through whitelisted registry-based communication Fundamental
    to all this is a Proven Digital Identity and KYC management system that is authentic,
    fool-proof with secure verification management system that assures privacy of
    individual citizens, authorities, devices or applications. The approaches to implementing
    Blockchain applications are described in the following chapters.CHAPTER 4 Design
    Thinking & Blockchain Solution design Design thinking is the process of empathising
    with the potential, existing and targeted customers to innovatively solve the
    problems and create products and solutions for the internal and external stakeholders.
    Design thinking refers to the cognitive, strategic and practical processes by
    which design concepts (proposals for products, buildings, machines, communications,
    etc.) are developed. A 3 staged five-phase of the design innovation process is
    described by Plattner, Meinel, and Leifer as: Stage 1: Inspiration behind the
    project and understanding the problem: This understanding can be documented in
    a brief which includes constraints that gives the project team a framework from
    which to begin, benchmarks by which they can measure progress, and a set of objectives
    to be realized.  (Re)Defining the problem & Hypothesis: The business or the entrepreneur
    is inspired to solve a compelling problem that presents an opportunity for significant
    improvement in the status quo. In this stage, the identified problems are formulated
    into a hypothesis that points towards suggested solution, from the customer perspective. Need
    finding and Design Challenge formulation from Customers‘ perspective: The customers’
    needs and wants are crystallised and converted into Design challenges. The problems
    that the customers face are converted into design challenges by comparing with
    ideal scenarios and comparable situations that point out to solutions being in
    place. Designers approach users with the goal of understanding their wants and
    needs, what might make their life easier and more enjoyable and how technology
    can be useful for them. Empathic design transcends physical ergonomics to include
    understanding the psychological and emotional needs of people—the way they do
    things, why and how they think and feel about the world, and what is meaningful
    to them. Stage 2: Designing and Validating the Solution:  Ideating (Divergent
    and Convergent Ideation is idea generation. The process is characterized by the
    alternation of divergent and convergent thinking, typical of design thinking process. Divergent
    thinking, involves diverse groups of stakeholders in a structured brainstorming
    process of “thinking outside the box.” Convergent thinking, on the other hand,
    aims for zooming and focusing on the different proposals to select the best choice,
    which permits continuation of the design thinking process to achieve the final
    goals. Best ideas generated during ideation are turned into concrete products
    or services. These are then prototyped and are then tested, evaluated, iterated,
    and refined. A prototype, or even a rough mock-up helps to gather feedback and
    improve the idea. Prototypes can speed up the process of innovation because they
    allow quick identification of strengths and weaknesses of proposed solutions and
    can prompt new ideas. The Prototype process generally consists of 2 steps:  Low
    fidelity prototype or a Proof of Concept where the solution is demonstrated in
    a controlled atmosphere without much interaction with the existing systems and
    with nominal investment. High Fidelity prototype or Pilot Project: The successful
    and improvised low fidelity prototypes are then passed onto the next stage that
    involves a lot of time, effort, involvement and investment of management time.
    These are subjected to the real-life scenarios and are observed for the impact
    and expected improvements without any adverse effect. Testing: The process repeats
    itself by looping back through inspiration, ideation, and implementation more
    than once as the team refines its ideas and explores new directions. Stage 3:
    Impact assessment and maintenance: Assessing the impact and finetuning the process
    by revisiting the earlier steps for continuous improvement. Design thinking offers
    an interesting process and a set of tools that simplifies the process of finding
    solutions to complex problems and to design interesting solutions, products and
    services for entrepreneurs and corporate leaders. Blockchain being a disruptive
    & new paradigm extensively leans on design thinking approach to evolve and implement
    the solutions for complex problems. Applying Design Thinking to Blockchain Blockchain
    defined as an Augmented Distributed Ledger Technology is very much valuable for
    streamlining inter-enterprise processes and by employing a new generation of applications
    known as Smart contracts, facilitates collaboration, coordination and collaboration
    through real-time communication between unknown peers across the world for trusted,
    secure and transparent transactions. Being an inter-enterprise platform, it is
    not amenable for a variety of applications that are internal to the organization.
    It is very imperative to put in place a common agenda for several ecosystem players
    and ensure that the ‘Why Blockchain’ and ‘What is in it for me’ part of the questions
    are convincingly put forth and demonstrated. Gartner, a leading Technology & Management
    research advisory & consultancy in the world has outlined a three-phase approach
    to implementing Blockchain solutions across five different dimensions. The dimensions
    outlined by Gartner to describe a true Blockchain system are distribution, encryption,
    immutability, Tokenization & Decentralization. Distribution implies sharing the
    ledger of transaction records across multiple parties of the system, across globe.
    Decentralization implies a collective decision-making and ensures no single person
    or entity control over the decisions and assets in the Blockchain system. Immutability
    implies that the transactions cannot be reversed once approved and recorded on
    the ledger, Encryption helps in secured access and authorization to participants
    for conducting transactions and authorization of transactions to ensure the intended
    parties as per access protocols recorded in the system are followed by using PKI
    based approaches, ECDSA algorithms to link public keys and private keys and usage
    of hashing for preserving data integrity, ZKP protocols for privacy protection,
    etc. Tokenization results in the digitized representation of real-life assets,
    rights and identities on the Blockchain for tracking them through their lifetime. The
    three Phases of implementation are described below: Phase-1: Blockchain-inspired
    solutions: These solutions involving a few but not all of the five elements described
    above are incremental in nature, mostly supplementing the existing business processes
    without causing any disruption or distraction. These are mostly centred around
    the creation of Proof of Concepts and Pilots to establish Proof of value and achieve
    incremental benefits for increased efficiencies and improvement of existing processes. Phase-2:
    Blockchain-complete solutions: Once the enterprises are confident about the value
    proposition of Blockchain applications, a gradual expansion of scope to complement
    existing processes, replace them with inter-enterprise collaborated processes
    for greater economies of scale and tremendous benefits to their customers will
    be implemented. During this phase, the scope also involves leveraging all the
    five elements mentioned earlier. Phase-3: Enhanced-Blockchain solutions: Involves
    combining different emerging technologies like Artificial intelligence, Machine
    learning, Internet of things with all the five elements of the Blockchain for
    integrated applications for autonomous agents, smart cities, supply chains, etc.,
    for secured scaling and accelerated disruption. Investments in Blockchain become
    viable when the size of the network increases and grows bigger and bigger so that
    the investments are amortized over a larger value of businesses generating increased
    savings. Deciding on Blockchain Implementation: But before the need for Blockchain
    as a solution is decided upon, it is imperative to consider all other options
    to solve the problem in hand through traditional approaches. The following figure
    gives a list of questions that need to be answered, leading to the decision to
    implement Blockchain as a solution to solve the problems and provide a high Return-On-Investments. ![](image-3290wolb.jpg) Figure
    4.1: Do you need Blockchain? While the existing incumbents involved in running
    the businesses across the Governments are comfortable with the centralized approaches,
    the choice of a decentralized approach and Distributed Ledger Technology for the
    future is seen as a decision that may yield substantial returns but are fraught
    with unforeseen risks. As the technology is still in its early stage of adoption,
    several factors need to be considered by the decision-makers to undertake the
    decision to migrate to the new paradigm. The following table gives a bird’s eye
    view of the aspects to be considered for evaluating the suitability of a Distributed
    Ledger Technology-based solution. Source: https://www.cgdev.org/publication/reassessing-expectations-Blockchain-and-development-cost-complexity
    A high-powered committee with the involvement of the top management professionals
    should consider and analyse the various aspects of the problems to be tacked and
    evaluate the potential solutions. Implementing Blockchain Design Thinking, the
    process of evolving customer focused solutions is an interesting tool that is
    very much applicable to conceptualisation, implementation of Blockchain applications. World
    has been using a number of approaches to problem solving and solution development.
    Some of these approaches are compared in the following figure. ![](image-td486s6m.jpg) Figure
    4.2: Comparison of Solution design approaches in an enterprise context The Six
    Sigma Perspective A six-sigma-based approach with the following steps is the most
    appropriate way forward for a disruptive and new-generation technology like Blockchain. The
    steps are outlined as follows: Phase 1: Define: Identify and clearly outline the
    problem in hand to be solved. Mapping the stake holders: All the stakeholders
    like Internal stakeholders, external stakeholders, individual, organisational
    and even application / IoT stakeholders, that are being addressed for solving
    the problems need to be outlined well in advance and mapped to ensure that their
    interests are protected, problems solved and their value enhanced. For example,
    if we are designing a Project management platform for Infrastructure projects,
    some of the stakeholders could be:  Real Estate Developers Architects and Engineers Design
    Consultants Main and Sub Contractors Specialist Contractors Suppliers/Vendors Statutory
    Authorities Problems faced by the different stake holders need to be considered
    and addressed. In the application, there could be access modules developed for
    each of these stakeholders to carry out the roles assigned to them respectively. Phase
    2: Measure: Measure the key performance indicators that need to be impacted and
    evaluated for improvement and provide a measure for the Return on Investment.
    Benchmark with the best practices and other related/alternative solutions for
    assessing potential benefits. Phase 3: Analyze: Analyze various options, potential
    solutions and available platforms to arrive at the best-case option by considering
    all possible parameters like investments required, resources and all implementation-related
    challenges. Phase Design: Architect the solution from various angles like data
    flows, entity relationships, information management, application development and
    technological and infrastructural considerations. Security considerations for
    the applications and all associated environments have to be thoroughly thought
    through and factored in. The design has to thoroughly consider various aspects
    like confidentiality, interoperability, confidentiality and privacy requirements,
    cybersecurity issues at various levels and the issues relating to compatibility
    with existing legacy systems and integration thereof. As the existing centralized
    systems offer high transaction throughputs, the trade-off of the transaction volumes
    and speed with respect to the benefits like overall process-related gains, in
    the long run, need to be considered and factored in the design. Seamless integration
    with the legacy systems, payment gateways and banking systems, ability to board
    new members, new processes and also drop them if required should be an important
    design element so that the assets and identities can conduct transactions across
    multiple platforms with ease through APIs or other appropriate middleware. Phase
    5: Validate: Undertake a two-stage approach of implementing a POC (Proof of Concept)
    for demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution without impacting the organizational
    systems, in case of an untested application without time-tested use case scenarios
    and then undertaking a pilot project by integrating the solutions in a limited
    and isolated environment. Once all implementation-related issues are thoroughly
    evaluated, problems taken care and benefits validated, it is then time to scale
    up the solution to encompass a multi-department & multi-enterprise scenario. Blockchain
    being a new technology paradigm, there is not much information available on the
    Return-on-Investments, though intuitively, most of the time it is very clear at
    the outset that the process excellence and the exponential benefits due to ecosystem
    collaboration are very much evident to the initiators with long-term vision. When
    a Blockchain platform is created, all the applications possible between the participants
    on the same network can be envisioned and the returns quantified to evaluate the
    commercial viability with respect to the investments required. From the service
    provider’s point of view, Performance contracting that rewards the platform providers
    and the IT partners with a combination of fixed and savings-dependent variable
    revenue model can help get the Blockchain projects kicked off the ground in a
    win-win manner. Example of a Blockchain platform designed & developed to solve
    the problems of Project Management in Infrastructure Industry: ![](image-02ct1ey6.jpg) Figure
    4.3: A Blockchain Platform for managing Infrastructure Projects InfiProjects consists
    of several convenient modules suited to the infrastructure industry ranging from
    Design Management, Construction Management to Handover. User has flexibility to
    use any or all modules.  A cloud-based platform operating on a SaaS model. User
    can sign up and establish his credentials Competitive payment plans and flexibility
    to top up anytime. No limitation on the number of projects, stake holders or transmittals. In
    the module InfiTransmit, the user can:  setup roles and permissions, create projects,
    stakeholders, stages of work, disciplines, deliverables add purpose of issue,
    upload deliverables and create transmittals, view dashboard and analytics. All
    these transactions are stored on blockchain with timestamp and immutable transaction
    hashes on a distributed ledger. (Case study courtesy: Suresh Ram, suresh.ram@infiblocks.com) Scaling
    up the Blockchain Project: Implementing a blockchain application for your organization
    is a very involved and resource consuming activity. Following a systematic approach
    enables organizations to plan with a strategy and end in mind. It is imperative
    to keep an eye on the very business goal for which the company has embarked on
    a Blockchain project and should put in place a continuous review mechanism to
    see that the organization is moving in the right direction. BLOCKCHAIN SCALE UP
    TRACKER This consists of the following steps: A cross functional team of 7 members
    for each and every project whether it is a DAO or a private blockchain or a consortium
    project must be put in place for every project. ![](image-pt6it3le.jpg) Figure
    4.4: Governing a Consortium & Scaling up  Specific goals linked to the benefits
    the organization seeks to derive from the project have to be given to the concerned
    employees in the organization. For example, ‘Decrease in operational expenses
    due to automation by 25%.’ Reduction in cycle time by 30% etc. The same have to
    be split into team and individual goals across the organization and driven through
    a reward system to reinforce a positive approach and behavior.  Positivity and
    hope for the future for implementing new and path breaking initiatives has to
    be encouraged and persons in the organization who are having any indication of
    negative or un-cooperative behavior should be dealt with appropriately. Any cynical
    or negative approach in even a small corner of the company can have the potential
    to burst the bubble of enthusiasm and passion driven approach needed to make the
    new projects a success. Adequate resources across all the steps needed for implementing
    & monitoring the project and leading it to conclusion should be provided as this
    would have a long-standing impact the security & risk management of the organization
    in the long run.CHAPTER 5 Blockchain and Governments-Examples and Case studies Citizen
    Identity Management Identities and digital signatures for Access, Authentication
    and Authorization are the critical components of a Blockchain paradigm that provide
    the critical ‘Security,’ ‘Privacy’ and ‘Confidentiality’ to the participants in
    the network. Problems identified : Multiple records, Duplication of efforts and
    processes, Siloed systems and potential for identity fraud and that of stolen
    credential copies. Solution offered by Blockchain: Issue and verify once on Blockchain,
    link multiple identities to a unique Blockchain identity-operated through a single
    user interface or a digital wallet, eliminate the need for multiple verifications
    across establishments thus saving a lot of time, effort and documentations which
    maximizes the trustworthiness of the identity information. The Identity Management
    of citizens is a very important facet of the individual’s rights. However, the
    multiplicity of interactions and the potential unauthorized use of personal information
    in an indiscriminate manner for commercial purposes open a Pandora’s box of ethical
    issues along with personal security concerns. Blockchain offers a unique Digital
    Identity Management system that offers the safety and security of their personal
    data and allows the members to provide permissions to users of the identity information.
    The concept of self-sovereign identity and decentralized key management system
    offered by platforms like Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Indy, UPort or Aurigraph
    etc., enables the organizations to register members uniquely over a Public Permissioned
    network. ![](image-4tt4vj0p.jpg) Figure 5.1: Blockchain based Identity and Credential
    Management System The Government and its various departments will be able to access
    data over a National DLT platform while being able to track and trace data and
    transactions from heterogeneous platforms in one infrastructure. The National
    DLT backbone would offer a seamless platform for verified Citizen, Business and
    Government interactions that would be shared on a public ledger while maintaining
    requisite privacy. 6 Businesses can use the same platform for other functions
    such as license applications, employee background checks, compliance reporting,
    credit check and loan applications. Government notifications may also be delivered
    on the same system. Government Services The Government may offer a suite of digital
    services to Businesses and citizens. These could include processing applications
    and petitions directly handling and delivery. The Government may choose to deliver
    notifications and alerts directly to businesses and citizens with a digital auditable
    trail, delivery confirmation and read receipt that may be linked to Smart Contract
    for follow-up action. The Government services could also include tracking of criminal
    activities and records from all departments and security agencies as a centralized
    database would be impossible to maintain. Governments may also conduct elections
    and surveys at a fraction of cost and infrastructure used today while ensuring
    the integrity of the data collected and its immutability. The results would be
    reported immediately after closing hours with the count being taken in real-time.
    Use Cases involve collaboration among users, businesses and Government for delivery
    and consumption of services. The Roadmap starts with decentralized identification
    infrastructure, authenticating citizens and business and aggregating their respective
    documents from the issuers in the users’ Digilocker account. Users can issue and
    consume documents and services securely from the same Digilocker as a service.
    Examples include:  Citizen Identity Management across decentralized and heterogeneous
    sources Land records, Building plan approvals, tax assessments and payments and
    the consequent bank reconciliation, Permits and Licenses, KYC processing for citizens
    and business entities, Employee background verifications, Employee payments with
    salary, income tax, provident fund and professional tax reconciliation GST reconciliation
    across a value chain for input tax credit, DBT Track-and Trace under Central and
    State sponsored schemes to beneficiary. Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow the members
    to selectively disclose their identity without revealing confidential information.
    For example, the ZKP system allows the member to prove that he/she is above 18
    years without the help of a Pan card or reveal his/her Bank balance is above Rs
    10000/- without revealing the actual account details that could be confidential
    information. Estonia, considered one of the most digitally advanced countries,
    has put in place a comprehensive digital identity verification platform for its
    nation’s citizens, where citizens identified through their access card with identities
    registered on a Blockchain can access any of the Government and most private services
    and provide conditional access to their credentials that identify them without
    disclosing too many private details. The citizens’ identity is used by the Government
    and private sector to provide safe, secure and private access to their personal
    health records and also participate in different voting activities. An insightful
    coverage of Estonia’s Blockchain implementation is provided at the following link: Voting Problem:
    Tedious manual paper and printing intensive processes requiring humongous funds
    and fake/unaccounted identities pose enormous challenges for countries and enterprises
    undertaking elections for governing bodies and on-board resolutions. Solution
    offered by Blockchain By uniquely identifying voters in a fool proof manner and
    recording their votes through their digital signatures through a verifiable and
    non-refutable system, Blockchain eliminates fake votes, wrong votes and extensive
    paperwork eliminating wasteful processes to reduce costs enormously. Registries
    & Certificates Problem: Fake certificates and high cost and time required for
    issuance and verification plague documentation of events from birth to will execution
    for asset acquisition and credential accumulation. Solution offered by Blockchain Educational
    Municipal, Police and other credential certificates can be issued and shared securely
    eliminating fakes and offering benefits for instant audit and reconciliation while
    establishing clear title. Benefits and Subsidy Distribution Problem: Fake claims,
    excessive middle layers leading to leakages and adding non-value costs drain valuable
    resources of Government and trusts. Solution offered by Blockchain Clear identification
    of beneficiaries, allotment and monitoring of benefit utilization for every unit
    issued with minimal intermediary intervention in near real-time allows for high
    productivity of welfare spends. SupplyChain Problem Procurement: Subjectivity
    and opaque procurement processes create leakages and mistrust. Financial Letter
    of Credit, Suppliers credit and other financial transactions offer a lot of scope
    for manipulation and mistrust. Provenance: Fake goods and wrong claims for premiumness
    hamper a variety of goods ranging from Pharma, food, imported, exported and specialized
    products Retail: Warranty claims, Loyalty rewards cross multiple vendors are difficult
    to track and often lead to disputes. Transport conditions: Un-monitored cold storage
    transported goods like pharmaceuticals, food, milk and dairy products lead to
    the consumption of spurious/expired products. Solution offered by Blockchain Transparent
    and Trusted processes offered by immutable, shared ledger of records between verified
    identities. Digital signatures for non-repudiation and shared ledger for near-real-time
    communication drastically reduces costs and scope for frauds. Smart contracts
    triggered to capture the events like a change of ownership and transfer of assets
    immutably on a shared ledger, help identify the origin of the products along with
    certifications of the originality of standard adherence, especially valuable in
    Automotive spares. Blockchain facilitates seamless tracking of warranty claims
    and allotted rewards until redemption for increased effectiveness and benefit
    of consumers. By recording the temperature of cold-stored items across the supply
    chain and tracking them on a Blockchain ledger, the consignment details of spoiled
    items can be quickly traced. This will minimize the propensity of wilful manipulation. HealthCare Problem:
    Fake drugs, Compliance in Clinical record management, health record tracking and
    settlement of insurance claims are often causes for fraud and manipulation. Solution
    offered by Blockchain Blockchain can offer multiple benefits for solving the various
    challenges of health care domains like seamless management of EHRs with utmost
    privacy and security features, transparent compliance tracking in case of clinical
    records and insurance settlement and Origin-to-chemist tracking of Pharma goods,
    etc. Smart City Problem: Unauthorized access by cybercriminals to leverage net
    connectivity of the IOT devices for DDOS attacks and illegal actions like crypto-jacking,
    data leaks, etc. The command and control of autonomous vehicles and drones need
    to be secured against cybercriminals. Solution offered by Blockchain Blockchain
    offers a protective shield for IOT Gateways, autonomous vehicles, drones and robots
    and prevents unauthorized access by criminals and manipulators. This enables secured
    automation. Blockchain facilitated accurate assessment of renewable energy claims
    and peer-to-peer energy trading among Prosumers. Cybersecurity Problems: Single
    points of failure of centralized management offer valuable targets for cybercriminals.
    Increasingly digitization and billions of internet connections managed by centralized
    systems run the risk of derailment and ransom attacks. WannaCry, one such virus
    infected 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages
    took $300 US Dollars per computer to decrypt and release the data. Solution offered
    by Blockchain By sharing distributing data across multiple ledgers, authenticating
    identities, encrypting transaction information, Blockchain offers a de-risking
    mechanism for data-intensive applications and blunts designs of Ransomware criminals
    who fraudulently sneak into corporate systems, encrypt the data and demand ransom
    to decrypt the same. The utility of Blockchain in eliminating fakes through trusted
    document management and ensuring source to destination ownership tracking can
    be succinctly summarized in the following lifecycle activities that could be authentically
    stored on a Blockchain. Cradle to Grave/Womb to Tomb – All certificates in one’s
    life from birth certificates, vaccination records, Health/Property and Academic,
    Non-academic and Identity records, Will recording and execution, etc., need impeccable
    tracking that Blockchain provides. Vivad to Viswas – Any agreements and compliance
    issues can be easily reconciled. Farm to Fork/Catch to Consumption – Safe and
    compassionate handling of animals and amphibians meant for consumption can be
    tracked through the supply chain. Procure to Pay – Complete transparency in the
    Procurement process by recording activities in every stage. Procurement is the
    biggest source of subjective behaviour that can be made transparent. Pay to Cash
    – Manpower and work outsourcing organizations can minimize Pay-Bill cycle leakages
    by instant settlements and eliminating the need for reconciliation. Admission
    to Academic and non-academic certificates and transcripts can be stored and shared
    privately without any fear of fake certificates and time loss. Segregation of
    Duties: In issues of Project management or execution of shared responsibilities
    in organizations, IT projects and new product development, there is a need for
    responsible and automated tracking of discharge of one’s duties. Digital signatures
    and non-repudiation help in achieving instant confirmations and recognition of
    good and productive behaviour. Start-up valuation and compliance tracking: Most
    of the small companies suffer from the inability to capture value contributions
    and tracking from the promoters and investors. Blockchain enables perfect, real-time
    valuation, promoter shares’ tracking and support in compliance management for
    the Start-up founders from the idea stage itself. Sanction to Settlement: Many
    activities in Government and enterprise domains need approvals and endorsement.
    Blockchain can track the documentation and attestations from approval to settlement
    in an impeccable manner. House designs, Police approvals for public meetings,
    large project budgets are some of the many such activities that can benefit from
    the Blockchain approach. The following solution depicts a typical document management
    solution by leveraging Blockchain technology to eliminate fake certificates and
    facilitate trusted sharing of information guaranteed by Blockchain while protecting
    from malware attacks and any form of unauthorized tampering. ![](image-0tyimfrx.jpg) Figure
    5.2: Blockchain-based Instant Document management authenticity verification system Loyalty,
    Games and Sweepstakes and many more applications that depend on Trust are lifelong
    relationships between hitherto unknown parties cutting across domains, will find
    Blockchain an interesting platform to adopt and provide value to the peers on
    either side. Blockchain can also help in a variety of Smart City applications
    to save lives and improve quality of life. The following case study showcases
    the use of Distributed Ledger Technology to seamlessly connect various actors
    in a smart city ecosystem to improve emergency healthcare response.  Collaborative
    Smart City Emergency Response for Smart cities: Smart cities in India have implemented
    various ‘smart’ elements across several dimensions to automate various aspects
    of the lifecycle of a citizen’s interactions with the Government. To facilitate
    smooth coordination between the citizens and the smart elements present in the
    city, ICCC (Integrated Command and Control Centre) has been set up by all the
    smart cities. However, the communication among all the smart elements is still
    lacking coordination especially with respect to a timely and coordinated data
    sharing. Faced with one of the highest numbers of traffic deaths across all the
    megacities of India at 157 per hundred thousand of population, Bhopal has sought
    to leverage Distributed Ledger Technologies to integrate various elements of its
    Emergency Response actors and their activities. ![](image-6yy8m6jz.jpg) Figure
    5.3: Challenges in Emergency Response Management By introducing the concept of
    distributed data ownership, where each stakeholder owns only their data, DEF removes
    a Single Point of Failure and helps introduce trust among all stakeholders. Stakeholders
    are able to transparently share information with an immutable audit trail of each
    transfer The ICCC is able to streamline the city’s Emergency Response service
    with other departments such as the traffic management system, hospitals, surveillance
    systems and the police. ![](image-pf2zvz33.jpg) Figure 5.4: Data exchange framework
    of ICCC to connect all the players in Emergency Response team(Source: Somish Solutions
    Ltd.) By implementing a shared ledger by leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology,
    the Smart City of Bhopal’s ICCC was able to create a rapid response to any emergency
    by the ambulance service to any accident case that is being reported by the citizens.
    The process flow is described below:  The citizen reports an incident via the
    108 Helpline. As the ambulance is dispatched the case details are shared with
    the relevant hospital, ensuring the staff has enough time to prepare for the emergency
    case. The ICCC (Integrated Command and Control Centre of the Smart City) o is
    informed of the incident location and designated hospital, which activates the
    ITMS to create a traffic-free route leveraging the surveillance, public announcement
    and traffic management systems. This establishes coordination among stakeholders,
    increased inter-department synergy and significantly faster transit time by triggering
    a green corridor for the ambulance transit. The Smart City of Bhopal, in association
    with the Institute of Development Studies and National Institute of Urban Studies,
    successfully concluded the pilot in collaboration with Somish Solutions Ltd and
    is planning to expand the pilot for wider implementation. Case study: Courtesy,

    Drones & Robots Using Blockchain Autonomous driving vehicles are expected to come
    onto roads in large numbers and are an amazing extension of IOT technology combined
    with artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. However, they
    are extremely vulnerable to hacking by cyber criminals. Blockchain offers the
    best possible security to the autonomous vehicles to ensure that, they are not
    manipulated and their owners are not held to ransom. In December 2017, an exciting
    disruptive technology company, XAIN and the global leader in automobiles, Porsche
    announced a partnership to take Blockchain technology to the management of cars. XAIN
    and Porsche successfully tested a proof of concept in which an Ethereum client
    is fused to the car’s systems and is connected to the Blockchain network comprising
    of IPFS and BAAS nodes in the azure marketplace. The car is tracked and managed
    through smart contracts and owner wallet present in the smartphone of its owner.
    The car’s systems are tracked and all the parameters recorded in the vehicle wallet
    that keeps track of various aspects about the car’s performance and activities
    etc. ![](image-sxyh46h2.jpg) Figure 5.5: System architecture of Blockchain powered
    car management implemented by Porsche & XAINFigure courtesy: Porsche Digital Lab The
    system will allow the authorized owners to access and communicate with their cars
    using the smartphone connected to the network and do the following from anywhere
    in the world through internet or through Blockchain powered direct offline connection
    in a secure manner:  Lock, unlock doors and luggage compartments from distance
    securely, Communicate with other cars in the network and exchange information, Record
    and manage all critical information on a decentralized trust less system and Prevent
    hacking by cyber criminals. Another interesting use case is that of managing the
    autonomous vehicles like drones for the welfare of citizens and protection of
    these vehicles for unauthorized hacking to use them for illegal & criminal activities.
    One such illustration is given in the following section. Controlling & Securing
    Drones, Robots etc., through Blockchain: According to a study by Transport Systems
    Corporation UK, a research conducted by them along with Sheffield University offered
    a breakthrough solution for controlling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by using Blockchain.
    Ability to control Drones, track and record their movements immutably and issue
    instructions only through secure authentication and access protocols can assist
    the security authorities in controlling illegal drone activities and ensure that
    the flight information can be audited & all safety standards can be adhered to. This
    can also lead to substantial improvement in usage of Drones for a variety of applications
    including ecommerce deliveries, media and movies etc. ![](image-gswv3nj6.jpg) Figure
    5.6: Secured Drone Management using Blockchain The Blockchain based backend system
    allows access to, from and between robots in a safe and secure manner so that
    no malware attackers and unauthorized cybercriminals have access to the agents
    of automation to cause havoc to the mankind. This also reminds of Technological
    Singularity, a hypothetical moment in time when any physically conceivable level
    of technological advancement is attained instantaneously. At this point which
    many experts predict to happen within the next 20 years, the self-directed computers
    will develop super intelligence with their intelligence increasing exponentially
    rather than incrementally. This, in case if it really happens, is expected to
    transform the life on earth and can also enable them to find solution to many
    human problems including disease and mortality. The only way in which this level
    of intelligence that is already growing exponentially to be secured and controlled
    is through the risk management and protective powers, the Blockchain technology
    offers. The internet of Robots marketplace secured through Blockchain allows for
    a safe and secured access to ensure that proper verifications and multi-level
    protection is provided to the Robots to ensure that they are used only for helpful
    and positive activities that benefit the mankind. The same can be extended to
    all autonomous objects for a breakthrough management in a secured manner, as shown
    in the figure on ‘Decentralised Management of Autonomous objects through Blockchain.’ ![](image-2gsannji.jpg) Figure
    5.7: Blockchain marketplace to Securely access Autonomous objects, Robots and
    Drones Central Bank Digital Currency Projects Another important Blockchain influenced
    application that can accelerate Smart city projects by facilitating digital value
    transactions between connected things and humans, while helping in unlocking the
    value of the data generated is the Central Bank Digital Currency Project. Currently,
    the US Dollar is seen as the globally interoperable currency accepted by most
    nations. In the recent past, several countries are experimenting with the concept
    of leveraging the internet for speedy transfer of value considering the impending
    proliferation of IOT & Industrial IOT-led Home automation, Industrial automation
    and Smart City projects across the world. There has been a strong need felt for
    a digital equivalent of the national currencies giving rise to the concept of
    Central bank digital currency (CBDC), also called digital fiat currency (a currency
    established as money by Government regulation or law). Central Bank Digital Currency
    is different from virtual currency and cryptocurrency, which are not issued by
    the state and lack the legal tender status declared by the Government. Various
    countries are already experimenting with the concept of CBDC and it is considered
    a transitory step to the ultimate eventuality of a fully digitized currency with
    the added security measure offered by a Blockchain approach. According to the
    BIS, today some 70% of central banks are looking at CBDC, with most of them considering
    Blockchain as the underlying technology. Some of the global Distributed Ledger
    Technology-based CBDC projects disclosed in the public domain are given in the
    following table published by Bank of Thailand in their project report on the state
    of CBDC project being experimented by BOT in conjunction with R3 Corda, Indian
    IT major Wipro and several transnational banks. ![](image-mk65pb4g.jpg) ![](image-nw4yfqbq.jpg) Figure

    5.9: CBDC & Financial Assets on Blockchain Project Inathon by Thailand Government Bank
    of Thailand completed Phase-1 and Phase-2 successfully and has demonstrated many
    advantages of issuing the Central Bank-backed digital currencies over a Distributed
    ledger. The findings from Phase-2 demonstrated the feasibility of Smart Contract
    utilization to automate bond life cycle events and DvP (Delivery Versus Payment)
    of inter-bank bond trading and repo transactions. The effective use of Smart Contracts
    has shown the potential to significantly streamline operational workflows and
    increase efficiencies. Fraud-prevention capabilities of the RTGS system were also
    augmented by the creation of a new end-to-end workflow that allowed validation
    of transactional information with external sources through integration points.
    The use of Smart Contracts for regulatory compliance purposes was also successfully
    tested in Phase-2 with the introduction of the NRFS mechanism, which could potentially
    eliminate multiple manual operational processes and allow banks to monitor NRBA/
    NRBS limits more effectively. Land Titling using Blockchain in Smart Cities A
    number of leading Digital Nations like UK, Dubai, Sweden have already started
    using Blockchain for maintaining Land Records, following case study of Land Pooling
    in APCRDA (Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority) elucidates how
    developing countries which are plagued by frauds and court cases in their Land
    Registry system can leverage Blockchain. Final implementation is however a long-drawn-out
    process involving multiple interactions, government transitions and resistance
    to change that could derail the process. Case study of APCRDA for Blockchain in
    Land Pooling & Land Titling (Source: AP Govt records in public domain) is discussed
    here. Background When a new city is developed from the scratch, land has to be
    pooled from existing owners and redistributed. In this process, the land parcels
    owned by individuals or group of owners are legally consolidated by transfer of
    ownership rights to the authority. It later transfers the ownership of a part
    of land back to the landowners for undertaking of development of such areas. In
    LPS the landowner will be getting Returnable Plots for the land he has surrendered
    with consent. Implementation Process Blockchain solution integrates with existing
    department systems through API calls & coexists non intrusively.  Uses http API
    calls – can integrate with systems/GIS Systems on different technical platforms. APCRDA
    GIS System data (Land Information) has been stored in Blockchain in Geo-json format. Modifications/Alterations
    of land records to follow the approved process and option is given for Authenticated
    Users only. Upon User request, GIS System (ArcGIS Server) generates Parcel images
    (Parcel, Block & Colony level location maps) along with Coordinates and Centroid
    of Parcel for Registration. Request API at Block chain server generates Block
    Chain Certificate embedded with QR Code (Information of Property). Existing systems
    include all transaction validation business logic & call APIs of Blockchain for
    respective data. Blockchain applications in Supply chain Blockchain has extensive
    applications in Supply Chain traceability to ensure transparency, minimise paperwork
    and facilitate trusted transactions between players in the ecosystem. IBM and
    Walmart promoted Food Trust Consortium, IBM Maersk promoted TradeLens consortium
    have facilitated end to end traceability of products along with continuous tracking
    of temperature & transport conditions This has potential to eliminate Fake pharmaceutical
    drugs, verification of premium certification to the farm level to assure authenticity
    for consumers. Solution Architecture ![](image-1um6cdr1.jpg) Figure 5.10: APCRDA

    Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection
    of 17 global goals designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable
    future for all.” The SDGs, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly
    and intended to be achieved by the year 2030, are part of UN Resolution 70/1,
    the 2030 Agenda. (Wikipedia) ![](image-179igt3v.jpg) Figure 5.12: Sustainable
    Development GoalsSource: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs Blockchain
    has helped in a multipronged approach to attain the Sustainable Development Goals
    by all nations. The utility of Blockchain for the same is given as follows.  Eliminate
    Poverty: Targeted Govt. benefits to poor persons with no leakages. Eliminate Hunger:
    Support Humanitarian activities targeted at food distribution in a coordinated
    manner. Crowdsource and track information on people deprived of daily minimum
    needs, World Food Program, is an example. Good health and well-being: Track medical
    records, eliminate fake drugs, support clinical trials and Pharma research and
    deliver and monitor high-quality subsidized cheap drugs. Track immunization health

    the world, take steps to track and improve afforestation, check desertification,
    aid in disaster management activities through coordinated actions. Peace, Justice
    and Strong Institutions: ID2020 and Digital Identities. Blockchains enable trust
    which would, in turn, help mitigate corruption. Partnerships: Global partnerships
    with win-win associations with collaboration, coordination, communication, cooperation
    facilitated by Blockchain. Thus, Blockchain has significant applications in Smart
    city Projects and in achieving Sustainable Development Goals as laid down by United
    Nations.CHAPTER 6 Blockchain Countries  Distributed ledger technology overcomes
    the problems of data centralisation thus, de-risking with respect to ransomware
    while overcoming limitations due to imperfect information infrastructure. Real
    time sharing of data across participants is made possible thus unifying the data
    silos. Immutable and tamper features of blockchain can improve trust, increase
    transparency & efficiency for a better cooperation & collaboration between departments. Smart
    contract-based transactions will dramatically improve scalability of transactions
    at the same time eliminating unwanted human interference. This offers immense
    flexibility for smart cities and makes them viable. Some case studies of Blockchain
    application in different countries across the world are given below: 1\. China China
    is home to some of the largest number of Blockchain projects with the Government
    encouraging the companies and start-ups to actively create innovative Blockchain
    applications to eliminate corruption and increase transparency in transactions. While
    it is not considered illegal to buy, sell or hold Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies
    the Chinese government encourages only those Blockchain activities that service
    the real economy. Chinese Government launched BSN (Blockchain based Services Network),
    an information infrastructure where all members share the same public services
    provided by their Government. The network aims to provide a unique global public
    infrastructure network in order to accelerate digital commerce. Think of it like
    an operating system, where participants can use existing blockchain programs,
    or build their own bespoke tools, without having to design a framework from the
    ground up. The BSN’s proponents say it will reduce the costs of doing blockchain-based
    business by 80 percent. By the end of 2020, they hope to have nodes in 200 Chinese
    cities. Eventually, they believe it could become a global standard. China leads
    the world in blockchain-related patents, according to the World Intellectual Property
    Organization. And blockchain goes far beyond Bitcoin; the technology can be used
    to verify all sorts of transactions (Source IEEE) Case 1: China Transportation
    Chain Launched by Ministry of Transport & 5 companies in city of Wuxi to solve
    problems of:  Traffic Congestion through better information sharing, Construction
    of urban parking facilities, Penalties for traffic violations, and Information
    security of the Internet of Vehicles. Case 2: Carbon Bank (Automobile) Public
    Chain Platform BYD (Carbon Bank integration platform), DNV GL (Certification),
    Veechain (Blockchain platform for automotive lifecycle management) are collaborating
    to integrate information of cars, large passenger cars, and other vehicles for
    on-chain storage. Dubai Dubai is patronizing Blockchain to eliminate all paper
    records across its governance, land records management, Police evidence tracking,
    Passport and VISA tracking, Cross/border remittances, Citizen Medical records
    tracking, etc., and save 5.5 billion dirhams annually in document processing alone
    equal to the one Burj Khalifa’s worth of value every year. Giving itself an ambitious
    target of becoming a paperless country, Dubai Government has been pioneering Blockchain
    and emerging technologies through a series of measures. Dubai Land Department
    is employing the Blockchain in three initiatives (Ownership verification in DLD
    Mobile Application, Property sale by Developer and Smart Leasing Process) targeting
    the improvement of providing the services, improve the collaboration with other
    parties involved the real estate market and to create a secured digital assets

    Technology for tracking Unsolicited Commercial Communication. Several states,
    Ministries, Income Tax department, Customs department, Public Sector Undertakings,
    NPCI and Police departments are vigorously exploring Blockchain to improve transparency,
    efficiency and eliminate corruption and fake products, documents, identity, and
    certificates menace. ![](image-4pipmxe1.jpg) Figure 6.6: Popular Use cases in
    India Singapore Singapore is working on a Blockchain-based payment system using
    digital Singapore Dollars, that can be used to execute inter-bank and cross currency
    remittances quickly and affordably and with fewer intermediaries. Being a global
    hub for Finance and Supply Chain activities and organizations, Singapore Government
    enables a vibrant Blockchain ecosystem for enterprises to experiment and implement
    entire spectrum of Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchain applications across
    Finance, Supply Chain, trade finance, Crowdfunding, health insurance, Digital

    with disruptive technologies like Blockchain, where it is adopting a five phased
    approach of moving the killer applications like Cross Border Trade and currency
    exchange from idea stage to production stage. MAS began experimenting with Blockchain
    by launching Project UBIN, to digitise Singapore Dollar and use a DLT ledger to
    transfer these Digital dollars across the banks in the country. After successful
    experimentation it has now cleared multiple stages of evolution to now be ready
    to adopt this technology for a number of use cases like Cross border remittances,
    connecting Singapore exchange with global trade and financial ecosystems, trade
    network exchanges for leveraging Distributed ledger technology for instant clearing
    and settlement. ![](image-0nu8ip2m.jpg) Figure 6.7: stages of Project UBIN by

    & services across the borders ![](image-arhm8n0y.jpg) Figure 6.8: GTCN Vision Through
    DLT platform, Singapore plans to offer a system of settling International assets
    in other countries with its Digital Singapore dollars for instantaneous, safe,
    and secure transactions. United Kingdom UK Government has been exploring Blockchain
    for several use cases like Central Bank Digital Currency for instant Inter-bank
    remittances, clearing and settlement, land records management, Government Data
    Provenance, Voting, Benefit and Charity distribution and Food safety in Supply
    Chains. 10\. US Government is working extensively on several Blockchain projects
    in Pharmaceuticals, Food, Cannabis, Defence Supply Chain provenance, health record
    tracking, Clinical records management, etc. Department of Homeland Security is
    researching Blockchain extensively for Critical Infrastructure protection using
    Blockchain enabled identification systems. 11\. Thailand Government is extensively
    experimenting with Blockchain for a variety of applications involving Digital
    identity, Supply chain and Central Bank Digital currencies. Annexure 1 contains
    a detailed analysis of the various activities being undertaken by Thailand Government
    and its Central Bank to leverage the Blockchain platforms for transforming Governance.CHAPTER
    7 Key Government applications of Blockchain Governments and public sector organizations
    leverage blockchain technology to move away from siloed and inefficient centralized
    systems. Current systems are inherently insecure and costly, while blockchain
    networks offer more secure, agile, and cost-effective structures. Governments
    can further provide cybersecurity, process optimization, and integrate hyperconnected
    services while bolstering trust and accountability using blockchain based solutions.
    Below are some examples where the government has partnered with either public
    or private players to help solve or address common regulatory challenges and facilitate
    the implementation of new, innovative solutions for the benefit of the citizens.  Telecom
    Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI): A government agency in India along with
    Tech Mahindra, a leading provider of digital transformation and consulting and
    Microsoft formed a partnership to create a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based
    solution for mitigating the issue of unsolicited commercial communication (UCC)
    which is a major nuisance to telecom subscribers across the country. The DLT-based
    solution brings all the relevant parties in the ecosystem onto blockchain, helping
    telecom service providers and telemarketers take care of preference registration,
    consent acquisition, dynamic preference setting, stakeholder onboarding, header
    registration, template registration, scrubbing service, and complaint handling
    and tracking – which are in line with the tenets of the TRAI regulation. The solution
    will be a shared, secured ledger of UCCs distributed across a network of computers,
    which will ensure a transparent and verifiable system to help companies mitigate
    UCC on their networks. It conforms to the recently passed TRAI regulation and
    will enable all ecosystem players to comply with it. Income Tax Department of
    India along with the Technology Partner Infosys decided to address the broader
    tax ecosystem concerns which includes banks, financial institutions, government
    agencies, enterprises, and individuals by creating a trust-based institutional
    collaboration where multiple entities share data securely and concurrently without
    a lot of point-to-point connections by a permissioned blockchain-based solution. Application
    of Blockchain for Vaccination Tracking (A case study): (Courtesy—Astra Quark Digi-Solutions,
    Chennai). nCovid19 is a type of Corona Virus that spread like a contagion across
    the world in early 2020 causing the death of thousands of citizens. Astra Quark
    Digi-Solutions, a Blockchain Start-up in Chennai envisaged the launch of a Blockchain
    consortium and a solution under the name ‘Curehona’ to address the spread of the
    virus in a multipronged manner. Some of the key advantages such a platform can
    offer to combat the deadly diseases are envisaged as follows: Verifiable, Immutable
    patient, treatment, protocol, progress and other records. Need-based expert intervention
    wherever required. AI and Analytics-based insights on the efficacy of various
    treatments/medicines/protocols/healthcare service providers etc. AQDL identified
    the following value additions that a Blockchain-based approach can provide to
    combat any health care emergency situation like the nCovid19 pandemic. Value propositions
    of Blockchain for Corona Virus (nCovid19) control  Track-and-Trace the Corona-affected
    persons Monitor day-to-day health conditions Comprehensive treatment management
    especially using approved allopathic and alternative medicines Connect patients
    to health workers doctors/facilities Treatment protocol management Patient cure
    and improvement monitoring and management Alternative medicines efficacy management Record/upload
    authentic experiences of patients and share the link to the video on a public
    distributed ledger Supply chain management—Provenance and availability of genuine
    medicines against prescriptions, Product and Vaccine verification Facilitate Charitable
    activities and track donation life cycle Insurance Processing and claims reconciliation The
    company set itself on its task to mobilize a global coordinated effort toward
    its efforts to champion this technology-enabled platform with the following objectives.  Multinational
    health firms can participate in a Blockchain-based platform that will connect
    local hospitals and health institutions in potential zones into which the virus
    may spread. Local hospitals can record medical data about patients who show flu
    or virus-like symptoms in the form of a public ID (patients will remain non-identifiable). This
    data can be tracked by the health firms in order to predict the spread of the
    virus based on the state of patients’ medical statistics. Countries will be able
    to strengthen their preventive measures in the areas where the virus can potentially
    spread—e.g., increasing the workforce of medical staff, providing medical supplies. The
    platform can offer an opportunity for all stakeholders and patients to exchange
    information, support and services in a trusted environment with regulatory oversight. Provide
    an opportunity for innovators to record ideas with provenance and establish proof
    of idea ownership Hash Log offers a Blockchain-enabled portal (powered by the
    platform Hedera Hashgraph) for real-time data collation and visualization to enable
    the netizens across the world to update themselves about the various statistics
    connected with this deadly disease, thus alerting the Governments and people across
    the world to understand the trends and the seriousness of the pandemic enabling
    them to be on guard. Blockchain technology is surely having an immense utility
    to combat global problems by rebuilding the broken trust in global supply chains,
    demand, supply and financing mechanisms, information sharing and enabling a coordinated
    and trusted research across the world. In fact, all the global leading countries
    should work together and form a new-age United Nations-supported Blockchain platform
    that acts as a ‘Trust bridge’ for a collective and collaborative approach to solve
    the global problems that are proving to be far more dangerous than the World Wars
    as we know! In April 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with
    world’s leading firms like IBM and Microsoft launched MiPasa MiPasa Blockchain
    platform to combat Coronavirus by connecting a multidisciplinary super-group of
    health professionals, privacy experts, and software developers, backed by leading
    technology companies and commercial entities. Utilizing powerful analytics and
    privacy tools, MiPasa works to gather reliable, quality data, and make it easily
    accessible to the appropriate entities to efficiently battle the ongoing Coronavirus
    pandemic in a humane, fair and more sustainable manner. Government could implement
    the following Blockchain solutions to effectively manage the health hazards like
    nCovid19 Pandemics.  Blockchain-based medical record management for all the patients
    to connect their medical records seamlessly and securely across all providers
    by retaining the patient’s privacy. Blockchain-based information-sharing mechanism
    to all the participants in the medical system like hospitals, regulators, service
    providers, patients, diagnostic centres and care providers to share authentic
    and trusted information required for a holistic patientcare and treatment, including
    spare capacities, critical care medical equipment, ambulance services, etc. Blockchain-based
    transportation management system to seamlessly integrate with vehicle registration,
    driving license and commercial tax collection systems to allow a smooth traffic
    flow across the national highways for speedy transfer of essentials and health
    care goods. Government of India’s Think tank, Niti aayog has pioneered many initiatives
    in emerging technologies and came out with comprehensive reports documenting the
    benefits of emerging technologies. Some of the applications of Blockchain that
    have been evaluated and recommended by Niti Aayog are given below. Subsidy management
    for Agricultural inputs. Problem In India, Government of India subsidises the
    pricing of fertilisers sold to farmers. The difference between the sale price
    and the certified cost price is passed as a credit to the fertiliser manufacturers
    by the Government. Due to a vast number of intermediaries, need for a lot of documentation,
    certifications and associated trust requirement and complexity, there is a significant
    delay in the processing of the subsidies leading to wastage of costs connected
    with accounting, documentation, intermediaries and reconciliation. Niti Aayog
    in association with PwC, a global leading consulting firm and Intel to conceive
    and implement a Blockchain pilot project to solve the above problems by leveraging
    its trusted automation capability. The following figure depicts the details of
    the pilot implemented. ![](image-azxuwukg.jpg) Figure 7.1: Blockchain pilot for
    Subsidy transferSource: Niti Aayog Blockchain strategy report (Use case in collaboration
    with PwC) The following benefits have been realised due to the implementation
    of Blockchain solution.  Productivity increase: Substantial reduction time taken
    for transaction acknowledgements between multiple parties involved. Near real
    time B1 certification: Immediate reporting of the details of the shipments against
    a few weeks taken earlier for reporting the same. Eliminated paper trails – Elimination
    of vast amount of paperwork and replacing the same with digital trails thus reducing
    a lot of cost. Standardised documents & easy entries: The use of standardised
    document templates & agreement templates eliminated need for associated clerical
    time. Eliminating Fake drug menace: A lot of lives across the world are lost due
    to the consumption of fake pharmaceutical drugs. NITI Aayog, along with a global
    pharmaceutical giant and other leading health care value chain participants, joined
    hands with Oracle to implement a pilot project to track and trace the pharmaceutical
    drugs from the manufacturer to the final chemist outlet. The details of the same
    are depicted in the following diagram. ![](image-y566jdyh.jpg) Figure 7.2: Blockchain,
    IoT, Cloud integration for medicinal drug traceability The following benefits
    were realised due to the Blockchain implementation:  End to end traceability of
    Pharmaceutical drugs for all stakeholders. Any Problems could be traced to the
    origin of the incidence increasing accountability. Medicine could be located with
    precision to ensure delivery planning and follow up. A common Blockchain platform
    implementation could eliminate the fake drug menace. Blockchain based Academic
    Certificates Problem As we have seen in the earlier sections, the paper-based
    certificates used by various academic institution need to be verified for authenticity
    at various junctures of a students’ career and there are prone to not only duplication
    or fakes, but also to substantial verification process delays. To overcome this
    problem, Niti Aayog evaluated the concept of issuing Blockchain based academic
    certificates, that are instantly and authentically verified from anywhere in the
    world. The following process depicts the use of Blockchain to issue instantly
    verifiable certificates. ![](image-oqvze45l.jpg) Figure 7.3: Blockchain based
    academic certificates (NITI Aayog, ISB) The following benefits have been understood
    from the analysis of the Blockchain SuperCert project.  Data privacy: Data stays
    with the entities that own them. Real-time, automated verification from anywhere
    in the world. Tamper and fraud resistant: Not possible for anyone to tamper with
    the certification contents. Permanence: the certificates will survive beyond organisations
    – removes dependence on the issuing authority for future verifications. Scalable
    to national and global level: The system eliminates manual record keeping and
    transportation of paper documents across the world, thus allowing form scalable
    automation. Niti Aayog’s paper demonstrates many more such real-life examples
    that includes use cases like: Secure personal document digital vault. Vaccine
    supply chain tracking. Trusted administration of Chit-fund transactions. Insurance
    (Medical, Automotive, etc.) EV Battery Swapping Organic Farming Energy management
    etc. For more detailed understanding of these case studies, please refer to the

    8 Blockchain Application patterns for Integration and Interoperability Blockchain
    is, in essence, a data structure of an ordered list of blocks. Every block in
    the Blockchain is “chained” to the previous block, using a hashed value of the
    previous block. The security features of the hash function prevent the alteration
    of transactions on the Blockchain without invalidating the chain of hashes. This
    design includes computational constraints and consensus protocols applied to the
    creation of blocks to prevent tampering of the information on the Blockchain. It
    is only imperative that such an immutable Distributed ledger will find its applications
    ranging from finance to a decentralized internet. The architecture of a software
    system, where Blockchain is one of the components is such that the Blockchain
    acts as an alternative for storing and sharing data, as well as executing Smart
    Contracts. The Blockchain component might also have tokens as digital currencies
    or representing other assets. The privacy and scalability limitations of Blockchain
    deem auxiliary databases in the system useful. The external world and traditional
    systems interact with Blockchain applications through a Blockchain Proxy layer
    connected to the platform. Blockchain Proxy layer abstracts many complexities
    associated with the interaction between disparate paradigms. It has the following
    main utilities.  Simple, convenient and familiar interface for interaction to
    push transactions and check outputs Provide access and service visibility as per
    functionality envisaged and permissions built-in Provide integration points with
    internal enterprise systems and between other external systems, oracles and other
    Blockchain systems through APIs and data connector middleware Communicate real-time
    updates to Blockchain ledger to the participants Provide an events-exchange-mechanism
    to update systems and databases in and out of the Blockchain platform as envisaged Blockchain
    is especially suitable for inter-enterprise or multiparty applications. Hence
    the most suitable model for implementing a Blockchain application is a democratic
    and collaborative approach of multiparty, Multi-Enterprise cooperation, coordination
    and collaborations. While undertaking Blockchain projects, the following activities
    need to be considered:  Prioritize problems Select the most appropriate platform Undertake
    POCs, Implement Pilots and scale successful pilots. Re-engineer and align internal
    processes for Blockchain implementation Undertake step-by-step implementation
    of the entire Blockchain-based system toa. Derive incremental benefits through
    integrating with back-end organizations, ERP and other systems Expand the scope
    to derive more efficiencies through increased involvement of employees at various
    levels and by increasing cross-enterprise network strength and collaboration Leverage
    increased network strength for expanding collaboration across many facets and
    offering more services as well as superior facilities to customers and other partners Deriving
    the benefits of efficiencies as envisaged by the Distributed Ledger Technology
    and increased Trust offered by the Blockchain system. A fair and professional
    Trust Anchor that offers fair and transparent management, a powerful Blockchain
    platform with durable secured storage, accessible to all participants via open
    APIs through a set of open standards to all participants for exchanging information
    and offering an open application and services marketplace are some of the topmost
    requirements of implementing a successful Blockchain consortium. Though typically
    a large organization or an industry association and a technology provider join
    hands to start working on a Blockchain implementation with foresight, over a period
    of time, a consortium will be formed and a new entity will come into place, like
    the United Nations Organization that is governed in an utmost professional manner. A
    typical architecture of a Consortium Blockchain implementation is given below: ![](image-5bf43mfs.jpg) Figure
    8.1: A typical Architecture for Blockchain Governance and Activities for Consortium
    Orchestration Collection of common Blockchain Application Architecture patterns Blockchain
    has many versatile use cases, and most of them can require relatively few patterns
    to implement. The Blockchain-based application pattern collection includes 15
    design patterns that shape the architectural elements and their interactions in
    Blockchain-based applications. These patterns are so devised as to align the application
    with the unique properties of Blockchain, curb its limitations, and achieve other
    quality attributes. These patterns can be segregated based on the fundamental
    needs they fulfil.  The patterns about the interaction between Blockchain and
    the external world describe different ways for Blockchain to communicate data
    with the external world, including Reverse and Legal and Smart Contract The data
    management patterns are about managing data on and off-Blockchain, including Encrypting
    on-chain Off-chain data and State The security patterns deal with the security
    aspect of the Blockchain-based application and aim to add dynamism to the authorization
    of transactions and smart contracts. They comprise of multiple Off-chain secret-enabled
    dynamic authorization and The contract structural patterns define the dependencies
    among Smart Contracts and the immutable behavior of Smart Contracts. They aid
    in overcoming the primary challenge, which hinders the evolution of Blockchain-based
    applications: How to upgrade a Smart Contract to a new registry and data contract
    are two patterns that target to improve the upgradability of Smart Contracts.
    Embedded permission and Factory contract are patterns that aim to improve the
    security of Smart Contracts. Finally, Incentive execution concerns the maintenance
    of Smart The pattern collection provides architectural guidance for developers
    to build applications on the Blockchain. Some patterns are designed specifically
    for applications keeping in mind the unique properties of the Blockchain. Others
    are variants of existing software patterns applied to Smart Contracts. Let us
    delve deeper into the Blockchain-based application pattern collection by examining
    the patterns of how they uniquely solve different types of problems. A more detailed
    explanation of these concepts is beyond the scope of this book and can be referred
    from the white paper written by Xiwei Xu, Cesare Pautasso, Liming Zhu, Qinghua
    Lu, and Ingo Weber. 2018\. (A Pattern Collection for Blockchain-based Applications.
    https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325439030_A_Pattern_Collection_for_Blockchain-based_Applications/ Interaction
    with external world patterns The primary architectural consideration for a Blockchain-based
    application is to decide what data and Smart Contracts should be kept on and off-chain
    while bearing performance and privacy concerns in mind. Verifier As the Blockchain
    is increasingly being used as a distributed database for more general purposes
    other than financial services, the application might need to interact with other
    external systems. So, the validation of transactions on the Blockchain might depend
    on states of external systems. Problem: The execution environment of a Blockchain
    is self-contained and can only access information present in the data and transactions
    present on the Blockchain. Besides, the state of external systems is not directly
    accessible to Smart Contracts. Solution: A verifier is a Trusted Third Party introduced
    to evaluate conditions that cannot be expressed in a Smart Contract running within
    the Blockchain environment and thereby connect this closed execution environment
    with the external world. In essence, it provides Smart Contracts with information
    about the external world. The verifier can be implemented both inside a Blockchain
    network as well as a server outside the Blockchain. All in all, the verifier boosts
    enhances trust in an unbiased third party, and checks validity within the network. Reverse
    Verifier In a software system where Blockchain is one of the components, the other
    parts might need the data stored and Smart Contracts running on the Blockchain
    to check certain conditions. The Reverse Verifier relies on Smart Contracts running
    on Blockchain to validate data and check the required status. Problem: Certain
    domains use exceedingly large and mature systems that comply with standards by
    default. The need of the hour then is a non-intrusive approach to leverage the
    existing systems with Blockchain without changing its core. Solution: The ID of
    the transactions or blocks on the Blockchain is data that can be integrated into
    the existing systems with ease. Smart contracts running on the Blockchain can
    implement the validation of said data. The Reverse Verifier pattern boosts connectivity
    while employing a non-intrusive approach toward existing systems. Legal and Smart
    Contract Pair With the digitization of the legal industry, digital signatures
    have found its way to signing legal agreements. Digital legal agreements need
    to be executed and enforced without losing the value of the legal prose. Problem:
    An independent, trustworthy execution platform trusted by the involved participants
    is needed to execute the digital legal agreement. Blockchain, bound with corresponding
    Smart Contracts, is an ideal candidate. Solution: The Smart Contract implements
    conditions defined in the legal agreement and, when deployed, possesses a variable
    to store the hash-value of the legal agreement. This bidirectional binding of
    a physical agreement with a Smart Contract establishes the bridge between the
    off-chain physical agreement and the on-chain Smart Contract. This pairing automates
    the enforcement of legal conditions and creates an audit But it does so by lowering
    and interpretation of legal Data Management Patterns Encrypting On-Chain Data For
    some applications on the Blockchain, there might be commercially critical data
    that should only be accessible to the involved participants. The confidentiality
    of such data should be ensured by encrypting it and making it inaccessible to
    the other users. Problem: Data Privacy is compromised because all the information
    on the Blockchain is publicly available to its participants. There is no privileged
    user within the Blockchain network, no matter the type of Blockchain: public,
    consortium, or private. Solution: To preserve the participants’ privacy, their
    data should be encrypted before insertion into the Blockchain. A possible design
    for sharing encrypted data among multiple participants is by utilizing a secret
    key. One of the involved participants creates a secret key for encrypting data
    and distributes it. When a participant needs to add a new data item, they then
    encrypt it using the secret key. Only the participants allowed to access the transaction
    have the secret key and can decrypt the information. The benefit of this method
    is the fulfilment of the confidentiality needs of participants. But it also has
    its key sharing and access Tokenization Tokenization is a means to reduce risk
    in handling high-value financial instruments by replacing them with equivalents
    (Think of tokens in a casino). Tokens can represent a wide range of goods which
    are transferable and fungible. Problem: Tokens representing assets should be the
    authoritative source of the corresponding assets. Solution: Of the two ways to
    achieve Tokenization on the Blockchain, naive tokens on a Blockchain (e.g., BTC
    on Bitcoin, ETC on Ethereum) are part of a system where the tokens represent monetary
    value or physical assets. However, this method is limited because it can only
    implement the title transfer of the assets with limited conditions checking. A
    more flexible way is to define a data structure in a Smart Contract to represent
    physical assets. By using Smart Contracts, some functions can be implemented and
    associated with the ownership transfer. Risk reduction and authority enforcement
    are the pros of Tokenization. However, some levels of integrity and standardization
    are compromised. Off-Chain Data Storage Some applications consider using the Blockchain
    to guarantee the integrity of large amounts of data that may not fit in the Blockchain
    by employing hashing. Problem: The Blockchain has limited storage capacity and
    storing large amounts of data within a transaction may be impossible due to the
    limited size of the blocks. On the other hand, data cannot take advantage of the
    immutability or integrity guarantees without being stored on the Blockchain. Solution:
    For large amounts of data, rather than storing the raw data directly on the Blockchain,
    a smaller representation of the data is stored instead. The solution is to store
    a hash-value of the raw data on-chain. A hash function like SHA generates the
    hash-value, which maps data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. If even one
    bit of the data changes, its corresponding hash-value would change as well, thus
    guaranteeing the integrity of data and reducing the cost of storage in the Blockchain.
    However, some of the drawbacks include data loss and data State Channel Micro-payments
    are payments that can be as small as a few cents, and Blockchain has the potential
    to be used for such transactions. The question is the necessity and cost-effectiveness
    of storing all micro-payment transactions on the Blockchain. Problem: Transactions
    can take minutes to an hour to commit to the Blockchain. Due to the extended overhead
    and high transaction fees on a Public Blockchain, it is infeasible to store every
    micro-payment transaction on the Blockchain network. Solution: A payment channel
    can is established between two participants, with deposits from participants locked
    up as security in a contract during the channel’s lifetime. The channel keeps
    the intermediate states of the micro-payment off-chain and only stores the finalized
    payment on-chain. This system of channels can accentuate the and reduce the cost
    of transactions and can compromise the trustworthiness of participants. Security
    Patterns Multiple Authorization In Blockchain-based applications, activities require
    authorization by multiple Blockchain addresses. A set of Blockchain addresses
    that can authorize a transaction is pre-defined. But only its subset is needed
    to allow transactions. Problem: The actual addresses that authorize an activity
    can fluctuate with the availability of the authorities. Solution: A dynamic way
    is to decide upon the set of Blockchain addresses for authorization just before
    the corresponding transaction is committed to the Blockchain network. An M-of-N
    multi-signature method can define that M out of N private keys are required to
    authorize the transaction. Such an on-chain mechanism enables a more flexible
    binding of authorities. As flexibility and tolerance of lost keys come along with
    this method, it compromises knowledge of pre-defined authorities and the cost
    of Off-Chain Secret-Enabled Dynamic Authorization In Blockchain-based applications,
    activities need to be authorized by one or more participants that may be unknown
    when a transaction is submitted Problem: Sometimes, the authority that can authorize
    a given activity is unknown when the corresponding transaction commits to the
    Blockchain. Blockchain also does not support dynamic binding with an address of
    a participant who is unknown in the particular transaction. Solution: A single
    off-chain secret can enable dynamic authorization when the participant authorizing
    a transaction is unknown beforehand. With this solution, the recipient of the
    transaction does not need to be defined previously in the contract. The solution
    encourages dynamism and But the secret is of single-use and requires protection
    against loss of X-Confirmation The immutability of a Blockchain using Proof-of-work
    consensus is probabilistic. There is always a chance that the most recent few
    blocks get replaced by a competing chain fork. Problem: At the time a fork occurs,
    there is uncertainty as to which branches will remain in the Blockchain and which
    won’t. Solution: A security strategy is to wait for a certain number (X) of blocks
    to be generated after the transaction gets included in a block. After X blocks,
    the transaction gets committed onto the chain and perceived as immutable. The
    solution fortifies the immutability of transactions but may increase Contract
    structural patterns Contract Registry Like any software application, Blockchain-based
    applications should upgrade to new versions. These updates involve renewing the
    on-chain functions defined in Smart Contracts as well. Problem: Smart contracts
    deployed on the Blockchain cannot upgrade because its code stored on the Blockchain
    is immutable. Solution: An on-chain registry contract is used to maintain a mapping
    between user-defined names and the Blockchain addresses of the registered contracts.
    The address of the registry contract needs to be known off-chain. Before invoking
    the registered contact, the address of the latest version of a Smart Contract
    is identified by looking up its name on the contract registry. The solution provides
    transparent upgradability and version But it can detract the extent of upgradability
    and increase Data Contract The need to upgrade a Blockchain-based application
    and its original Smart Contracts over time is ultimately necessary. Even as logic
    and data change at different times with different frequencies. Problem: While
    upgrading Smart Contracts, the upgrading transactions might contain large data
    storage for copying the data from the old to the new Smart Contract, and porting
    data to newer versions might require multiple transactions. Solution: To avoid
    movement of data during contract upgrades, the data store is isolated from the
    rest of the code. So, data in different Smart Contracts are isolated, and the
    more generic and flexible data structure is used by all the other logic Smart
    Contracts and is unlikely to require changes. The benefits include upgradability
    and cost Embedded Permission The Smart Contracts running on Blockchain can be
    accessed by all the participants and other Smart Contracts by default because
    there are no privileged users. In the case of a Public Blockchain, particularly,
    every participant in the network can access the information and code stored on
    the Blockchain. Problem: A Smart Contract by default has no owner and once deployed,
    the author of the Smart Contract has no special privilege. A Permissionless function
    can be triggered by unauthorized users accidentally and can deem Blockchain-based
    applications vulnerable. Solution: By embedding permission-control to every Smart
    Contract function to check permissions for every caller that triggers the functions
    defined in the Smart Contract, access gets restricted to unauthorized users. Permission-control
    can enhance security and authorization of the Smart Contracts, the caveat being
    a higher cost of implementation of permission-control. Factory Contract Applications
    based on the Blockchain might need to use multiple instances of a standard contract
    with customization. Each contract instance is created by instantiating a contract
    template that can be stored off-chain in a code repository, or on-chain, within
    a Smart Contract. Problem: Keeping the contract template off-chain cannot guarantee
    consistency between different Smart Contract instances created from the same template
    because the template source code can be independently modified. Solution: Smart
    contracts get created from a contract factory deployed on the Blockchain. The
    factory contract has its roots in the off-chain source code. The factory will
    then contain the definition of multiple Smart Contracts. This method provides
    boosted security and efficiency at the cost of deployment and function Incentive
    Execution Smart contracts are event-driven programs that cannot execute autonomously.
    The functions defined in a Smart Contract need to be triggered either by an external
    transaction or another Smart Contract to execute. Problem: Users of a Smart Contract
    have no direct benefit from calling the accessorial functions. When using a Public
    Blockchain, executing these functions cause extra monetary cost, leading up to
    an expensive process. Solution: Providing rewards to the caller of the contract
    function for invoking the execution can guarantee the completeness of regular
    services through accessorial functions, the downside being the unguaranteed execution
    of accessory functions. To conclude, Blockchain can be viewed holistically as
    a fundamental building block of large-scale decentralized software systems. Patterns
    that show how to make good use of the Blockchain in the design of systems and
    applications are imperative for the effective use of Blockchain to this end. As
    Blockchain acts as a Trusted Third Party to record the transaction history between
    two parties, it becomes imperative for members to have secured and private access
    to their records without recourse to the other dominant party’s (example Bank,
    Market place, etc.) or the creator of records. The Court of Justice of the European
    Union has mandated the Blockchain administrators to ensure the same in one of
    its judgments in January 2017\. Hence, this needs to be ensured and a replicated
    encrypted database for Disaster Recovery and accessible to the clients. This is
    an opportunity for third party-regulated Data Vault providers. Setting and Scaling
    Up Blockchain Projects Blockchain defined as an Augmented Distributed Ledger Technology
    is very much valuable for streamlining inter-enterprise processes and by employing
    a new generation of applications known as Smart contracts, facilitates collaboration,
    coordination and collaboration through real-time communication between unknown
    peers across the world for trusted, secure and transparent transactions. Being
    an inter-enterprise platform, it is not amenable for a variety of applications
    that are internal to the organization. It is very imperative to put in place a
    common agenda for several ecosystem players and ensure that the ‘Why Blockchain’
    and ‘What is in it for me’ part of the questions are convincingly put forth and
    demonstrated. Gartner, a leading Technology & Management research advisory & consultancy
    in the world has outlined a three-phase approach to implementing Blockchain solutions
    across five different dimensions. The dimensions outlined by Gartner to describe
    a true Blockchain system are distribution, encryption, immutability, Tokenization
    and Decentralization. Distribution implies sharing the ledger of transaction records
    across multiple parties of the system, across the globe. Decentralization implies
    a collective decision-making and ensures no single person or entity control over
    the decisions and assets in the Blockchain system. Immutability implies that the
    transactions cannot be reversed once approved and recorded on the ledger, Encryption
    helps in secured access and authorization to participants for conducting transactions
    and authorization of transactions to ensure the intended parties as per access
    protocols recorded in the system are followed by using PKI based approaches, ECDSA
    algorithms to link public keys and private keys and usage of hashing for preserving
    data integrity, ZKP protocols for privacy protection, etc. Tokenization results
    in the digitized representation of real-life assets, rights and identities on
    the Blockchain for tracking them through their lifetime. The three Phases of implementation
    are described below: Phase-1: Blockchain-inspired solutions: These solutions involving
    a few but not all the five elements described above are incremental in nature,
    mostly supplementing the existing business processes without causing any disruption
    or distraction. These are mostly centred around the creation of Proof of Concepts
    and Pilots to establish Proof of value and achieve incremental benefits for increased
    efficiencies and improvement of existing processes. Phase-2: Blockchain-complete
    solutions: Once the enterprises are confident about the value proposition of Blockchain
    applications, a gradual expansion of scope to complement existing processes, replace
    them with inter-enterprise collaborated processes for greater economies of scale
    and tremendous benefits to their customers will be implemented. During this phase,
    the scope also involves leveraging all the five elements mentioned earlier. Phase-3:
    Enhanced-Blockchain solutions: Involves combining different emerging technologies
    like Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Internet of things with all the
    five elements of the Blockchain for integrated applications for autonomous agents,
    smart cities, supply chains, etc., for secured scaling and accelerated disruption. Investments
    in Blockchain become viable when the size of the network increases and grows bigger
    and bigger so that the investments are amortized over a larger value of businesses
    generating increased savings. Deciding on Blockchain Implementation But before
    the need for Blockchain as a solution is decided upon, it is imperative to consider
    all other options to solve the problem in hand through traditional approaches.
    The following figure gives a list of questions that need to be answered, leading
    to the decision to implement Blockchain as a solution to solve the problems and
    provide a high Return-On-Investments. While the existing incumbents involved in
    running the businesses across the Governments are comfortable with the centralized
    approaches, the choice of a decentralized approach and Distributed Ledger Technology
    for the future is seen as a decision that may yield substantial returns but are
    fraught with unforeseen risks. ![](image-d2d9o5q9.jpg) Figure 8.2: Do you need
    Blockchain? As the technology is still in its early stage of adoption, several
    factors need to be considered by the decision-makers to undertake the decision
    to migrate to the new paradigm. The following table gives a bird’s eye view of
    the aspects to be considered for evaluating the suitability of a Distributed Ledger
    Technology-based solution. Source: https://www.cgdev.org/publication/reassessing-expectations-Blockchain-and-development-cost-complexity A
    high-powered committee with the involvement of the top management professionals
    should consider and analyze the various aspects of the problems to be tacked and
    evaluate the potential solutions. Implementing Blockchain—The Six Sigma Perspective A
    six-sigma-based approach with the following steps is the most appropriate way
    forward for a disruptive and new-generation technology like Blockchain. The steps
    are outlined as follows:  Define: Identify and clearly outline the problem in
    hand to be solved. Measure: Measure the key performance indicators that need to
    be impacted and evaluated for improvement and provide a measure for the Return
    on Investment. Benchmark with the best practices and other related/alternative
    solutions for assessing potential benefits.  Analyze: Analyze various options,
    potential solutions and available platforms to arrive at the best-case option
    by taking into account all possible parameters like investments required resources
    and all implementation-related challenges. Design: Architect the solution from
    various angles like data flows, entity relationships, information management,
    application development and technological and infrastructural considerations.
    Security considerations for the applications and all associated environments have
    to be thoroughly thought through and factored in.  The design has to thoroughly
    take into account various aspects like confidentiality, interoperability, confidentiality
    and privacy requirements, cybersecurity issues at various levels and the issues
    relating to compatibility with existing legacy systems and integration thereof. As
    the existing centralized systems offer high transaction throughputs, the trade-off
    of the transaction volumes and speed with respect to the benefits like overall
    process-related gains, in the long run, need to be considered and factored in
    the design. Seamless integration with the legacy systems, payment gateways and
    banking systems, ability to board new members, new processes and drop them if
    required should be an important design element so that the assets and identities
    can conduct transactions across multiple platforms with ease through APIs or other
    appropriate middleware. Validate: Undertake a two-stage approach of implementing
    a POC (Proof of Concept) for demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution without
    impacting the organizational systems, in case of an untested application without
    time-tested use case scenarios and then undertaking a pilot project by integrating
    the solutions in a limited and isolated environment. Once all implementation-related
    issues are thoroughly evaluated, problems taken care and benefits validated, it
    is then time to scale up the solution to encompass a multi-department and multi-enterprise
    scenario. Blockchain being a new technology paradigm, there is not much information
    available on the Return-on-Investments, though intuitively, most of the time it
    is very clear at the outset that the process excellence and the exponential benefits
    due to ecosystem collaboration are very much evident to the initiators with long-term
    vision. When a Blockchain platform is created, all the applications possible between
    the participants on the same network can be envisioned and the returns quantified
    to evaluate the commercial viability with respect to the investments required. From
    the service provider’s point of view, Performance contracting that rewards the
    platform providers and the IT partners with a combination of fixed and savings-dependent
    variable revenue model can help get the Blockchain projects kicked off the ground
    in a win-win manner. Different models for revenue generation like annual subscription,
    transaction-based pricing, maintenance and Smart Contract upgradation and maintenance
    can be considered with a possibility of increased usage not only from the existing
    applications but also due to the new business generation possibility with the
    increased network clientele aggregation possible.CHAPTER 9 Applying Design Thinking
    to Blockchain Blockchain defined as an Augmented Distributed Ledger Technology
    is very much valuable for streamlining inter-enterprise processes and by employing
    a new generation of applications known as Smart contracts, facilitates collaboration,
    coordination and collaboration through real-time communication between unknown
    peers across the world for trusted, secure and transparent transactions. Being

    that are internal to the organization. It is very imperative to put in place a
    common agenda for several ecosystem players and ensure that the ‘Why Blockchain’
    and ‘What is in it for me’ part of the questions are convincingly put forth and
    demonstrated. Design Thinking, the process of evolving customer focused solutions
    is an interesting tool that is very much applicable to conceptualisation, implementation
    of Blockchain applications. World has been using a number of approaches to problem
    solving and solution development. Some of these approaches are compared in the
    following figure. ![](image-rvzkmpfv.jpg) Figure 9.1: Comparison of Solution design
    approaches in an enterprise context The Six Sigma Perspective A six-sigma-based
    approach with the following steps is the most appropriate way forward for a disruptive
    and new-generation technology like Blockchain. The steps are outlined as follows: Phase
    1: Define: Identify and clearly outline the problem in hand to be solved. Mapping
    the stake holders: All the stakeholders like Internal stakeholders, external stakeholders,
    individual, organisational and even application / IoT stakeholders, that are being
    addressed for solving the problems need to be outlined well in advance and mapped
    to ensure that their interests are protected, problems solved and their value
    enhanced. For example, if we are designing a Project management platform for Infrastructure
    projects, some of the stakeholders could be:  Real Estate Developers Architects
    and Engineers Design Consultants Main and Sub Contractors Specialist Contractors Suppliers/Vendors Statutory
    Authorities Problems faced by the different stake holders need to be considered
    and addressed. In the application, there could be access modules developed for
    each of these stakeholders to carry out the roles assigned to them, respectively. Phase
    2: Measure: Measure the key performance indicators that need to be impacted and
    evaluated for improvement and provide a measure for the Return on Investment.
    Benchmark with the best practices and other related/alternative solutions for
    assessing potential benefits. Phase 3: Analyze: Analyze various options, potential
    solutions and available platforms to arrive at the best-case option by considering
    all possible parameters like investments required, resources and all implementation-related
    challenges. Phase 4: Design: Architect the solution from various angles like data
    flows, entity relationships, information management, application development and
    technological and infrastructural considerations. Security considerations for
    the applications and all associated environments have to be thoroughly thought
    through and factored in. The design has to thoroughly take into account various
    aspects like confidentiality, interoperability, confidentiality and privacy requirements,
    cybersecurity issues at various levels and the issues relating to compatibility
    with existing legacy systems and integration thereof. As the existing centralized
    systems offer high transaction throughputs, the trade-off of the transaction volumes
    and speed with respect to the benefits like overall process-related gains, in
    the long run, need to be considered and factored in the design. Seamless integration
    with the legacy systems, payment gateways and banking systems, ability to board
    new members, new processes and also drop them if required should be an important
    design element so that the assets and identities can conduct transactions across
    multiple platforms with ease through APIs or other appropriate middleware. Phase
    5: Validate: Undertake a two-stage approach of implementing a POC (Proof of Concept)
    for demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution without impacting the organizational
    systems, in case of an untested application without time-tested use case scenarios
    and then undertaking a pilot project by integrating the solutions in a limited
    and isolated environment. Once all implementation-related issues are thoroughly
    evaluated, problems taken care and benefits validated, it is then time to scale
    up the solution to encompass a multi-department & multi-enterprise scenario. Blockchain
    being a new technology paradigm, there is not much information available on the
    Return-on-Investments, though intuitively, most of the time it is very clear at
    the outset that the process excellence and the exponential benefits due to ecosystem

    and the IT partners with a combination of fixed and savings-dependent variable
    revenue model can help get the Blockchain projects kicked off the ground in a
    win-win manner. Example of a Blockchain platform designed & developed to solve
    the problems of Project Management in Infrastructure Industry: ![](image-ps28q3na.jpg) Figure
    9.2: A Blockchain Platform for managing Infrastructure Projects InfiProjects consists
    of several convenient modules suited to the infrastructure industry ranging from
    Design Management, Construction Management to Handover. User has flexibility to
    use any or all modules.  A cloud-based platform operating on a SaaS model. User
    can sign up and establish his credentials Competitive payment plans and flexibility
    to top up anytime. No limitation on the number of projects, stake holders or transmittals. In
    the module InfiTransmit, the user can:  setup roles and permissions, create projects,
    stakeholders, stages of work, disciplines, deliverables add purpose of issue,
    upload deliverables and create transmittals, view dashboard and analytics. All
    these transactions are stored on blockchain with timestamp and immutable transaction
    hashes on a distributed ledger. (Case study courtesy: Suresh Ram, suresh.ram@infiblocks.com)CHAPTER
    10 Consortium Approach-Operational and Architectural considerations As discussed
    earlier, Government led consortiums offer the right approach to implement Blockchain
    solutions that offer immense value to the entire eco-system facilitating transparency
    and enhanced productivity to all the organisations and the citizens at large. Joining
    a Blockchain consortium helps enterprises to keep up to date on technology trends
    and competitor activity, future-proof against potential new threats, and learn
    how to implement and integrate Blockchain. It is today’s decisions of a company
    that lay the foundations for the future and there is no question that Blockchain
    will play a role in the future. Moreover, IDC has forecasted worldwide spending
    on blockchain solutions to reach nearly $4.3 billion in 2020 – a tempered 57.7%
    growth from the $2.7 billion spent in 2019\. With this, consortia are likely to
    continue to be an effective mechanism through which Blockchain-interested companies,
    regulators, and governments collaborate. In this landscape, the strongest consortium
    could become the de facto moderator of Blockchain standardization. Blockchain
    is still waiting for this “break-out” moment, but with thousands of consortia
    anticipated to blossom over the next few years, they are likely to play a pivotal
    role in Blockchain technology collaboration and commercialization. It is these
    initial efforts and their related standardization, digitization, and interconnectivity
    that will make it possible to do even more in the future. What we should accept
    today is that Blockchain and consortiums are going to question conventional business
    models and reinvent value chains in the industry. Desirable elements in a Blockchain
    Consortium A truly successful blockchain consortium would be the one which creates
    an open and neutral platform underpinned by blockchain technology enabling true
    information sharing and collaboration across value chains, thereby increasing
    industry innovation, reducing friction among various business entities and—ultimately—promoting
    more global trade. By embracing open standards and interoperability, fostering
    trust across the ecosystem, spurring innovation and encouraging broad-based participation,
    Blockchain consortia should usher in a new era in —one where all parties can collaborate,
    share data, and realize the benefits of digitization. A successful blockchain
    consortium can be understood in three components. Each component would play a
    distinct role in allowing members to derive the most value for their businesses. The
    The foundation of any blockchain consortium is its business network. Each entity
    shares information that can be tracked, stored and actioned across the platform. The
    True to its name and in the spirit of collaboration, the Blockchain consortium
    platform should be accessible via an open API which helps to bring together the
    ecosystem through a set of open standards and share information securely. The
    Applications and Services An open Applications and Services Marketplace would
    allow both the consortium itself and third parties to publish fit-for-purpose
    services atop the consortium platform, fostering innovation and value creation. Digitized
    Documents Blockchain consortium should provide a framework for sharing documents
    among various participants, with security, version control, and privacy. Authorized
    users with the required permissions can upload, download, view and edit documents.
    Documents can be uploaded and shared as either structured documents, built to
    industry standards, which can provide rich data that can be readily located, analysed
    and interpreted or unstructured documents (like scans or PDFs). The consortium
    participants should be permitted to access documents based on a permission matrix
    which can be determined through a combination of the organization’s role and the
    document type. For example, TradeLens has and is continuing to develop standardized
    structured documents to replace the typical unstructured documents in use today
    in trade finance. ![](image-jn1rryjv.jpg) Workflow Automation Blockchain based
    solutions should provide a way for the permissioned participants to immediately
    contribute to and extract value from the consortium ecosystem. To achieve this,
    the first step for enterprises is to automate legacy businesses processes which
    could generate numerous benefits such as completing tasks faster, providing standardization
    of business documents and reducing costs, just to name a few. With digitized documents
    and permissioned sharing, blockchain consortium platform should facilitate the
    move away from legacy workflows (using paper or PDFs) within a single organization,
    to automated workflows across multiple organizations that dispense with costly,
    repetitive and error-prone manual inputs Application Programming Interfaces APIs) One
    of the blockchain ‘s strongest elements is the fact that it is guided entirely
    by the trust principle. -- interaction on the blockchain trusts and verifies the
    transaction and relies on the agreement of all nodes to monitor what is a decentralized,
    otherwise untraceable operation. The API culture is equally guided by trust as
    a key concept. Blockchain consortium platforms should be able to integrate seamlessly
    with users’ in-house systems via non-proprietary, publicly available APIs that
    are designed specifically for ease of set-up and use. Many of the successful consortiums
    today use Swagger for its APIs, which is a common framework for documenting REST
    APIs. Web User Interface (UI) One of the most common problems with all the blockchain
    based applications currently is that all the action is happening behind the scenes.
    It’s all server side or we’re going to say node side. While technologies and products
    are still maturing, the blockchain and server-side aspects have naturally gained
    more attention, both of which are vital to the project, often suggesting that
    there is no proper reflection in the front-end (web interface, mobile app, or
    UI desktop app). To put things in context, end users of blockchain based solutions
    have no idea as to whether this particular site or mobile device is using blockchain,
    which data and which steps are being coordinated on blockchain, and what is actually
    going on there. Hence, it’s a much desirable component for blockchain consortium
    platforms to have simple yet impactful web user interfaces to make blockchain
    applications more intuitive and accessible for the consumers. A good example here
    would be the Tradelens consortium which developed a very easy to use and adaptable
    Web UI for its participants. Tradelens interface can also be accessed via the
    web without integration. Users can also engage with essential platform features
    including the search and track functions and document access through a secure
    Single Sign On web app. ![](image-t3qwobp3.jpg) Figure 10.1: Dubai land registry
    - UI Interface Standards We believe that to encourage broad adoption and innovation,
    blockchain platforms must be open and interoperable. Organizations like the Hyperledger
    Project of the Linux Foundation, which has hundreds of members across all sectors,
    have created a breeding ground for business-savvy blockchain applications. Although
    business applications and networks are built on different blockchain bases such
    as Ethereum, Hyperledger, R3’s Corda, and Ripple, eventually they must interoperate
    in the broader economy. Therefore, blockchain technology requires that an enterprise
    establish a level of understanding that might lead to further innovations and
    standards. Such action will generate unique opportunities to improve existing
    business practices (application of technology) and establish new business models
    by using blockchain-based business networks. In a blockchain consortium, successful
    interoperability ensures that the user can trust that “I know what I see is what
    you see” within a single platform as well as across platforms. ![](image-io4cm521.jpg) Interoperability The
    definition for Interoperability provided by the US National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) is: “An interoperable blockchain architecture is a composition
    of distinguishable blockchain systems, each representing a distributed data ledger,
    where transaction execution may span multiple blockchain systems, and where data
    recorded in one blockchain is reachable and verifiable by another possibly foreign
    transaction in a semantically compatible manner.” One blockchain network will
    simply be unable to provide all the needs for any given trade transaction. There
    will need to be multiple networks, each providing specific value. Data from private
    networks can be routed to other relevant networks for transactions without having
    to establish a one-to-one integration. From a pure business perspective, the blockchain
    market will consolidate around industry consortiums, whose blockchain network
    will crowd out all other networks in that space. A network of blockchains is something
    more than the infrastructure that supports it. It is also a governance framework,
    business model, application features and middleware to interact between what the
    end user sees and the operation of the blockchain. Particularly in the enterprise
    blockchain space, where private networks are controlled and dominated by large
    powerful players, network functionality is highly specific to business needs.
    As a result, industry consortiums that are determined to be full-service blockchains
    for their members have kind of derailed, and those that are open to interoperability
    with other networks, including individual networks of their members, are gaining
    traction. Making Interoperability a first-class citizen of blockchains going forward
    will be key to maximizing efficiencies. Interoperability here means the possibility
    to freely share value across all blockchain networks without the need for intermediaries.
    In an interoperable ecosystem, you can interact with users from other blockchain
    networks without spending resources on translation or experiencing downtime. You
    can receive information from other members, process what they sent, and respond
    accordingly. Interoperability in blockchain consortium brings the following benefits: Smooth
    information sharing across participating blockchains  Easier execution of smart
    contracts across blockchains Sharing of blockchain solutions and cooperation on
    the ongoing development for enterprises The possibility for IT staff to develop
    a deep knowledge of a few prominent blockchain standards instead of having a basic
    knowledge of many protocols Opportunity to develop partnerships within the blockchain
    ecosystem Strong interoperability would give users a much more useful, user-friendly
    experience. With this interoperability, users will be able to experience the seamless
    integration of capabilities being offered by the blockchain-based networks. To
    achieve interoperability from a business perspective, the following issues must
    be considered and addressed:  Identity, data, and event standardization Governance
    compatibility/acceptance Acceptable risks Low Switching Barriers Blockchain 3.0
    projects aim for seamless interconnection between the following blockchains:  Multiple
    public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum Multiple private blockchains,
    such as Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Public and private blockchains, such as Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Blockchains with legacy systems, such as MediLedger and SAP or
    Ripple and SWIFT Blockchain Interoperability Model The interoperability model
    for blockchain solutions consists of three layers addressing the challenge for
    the full stack for the blockchain solution, including the underlying Blockchain
    platform on which it is built. The above model is intended for organizations to
    structure their efforts to:  Clarify interoperability requirements. Enable blockchain
    solutions to exchange and make use of their data; and Select one of three approaches
    to interoperability. The three approaches unique to blockchain interoperability
    as suggested by the World Economic Forum (WEF) is given below. Each approach comes
    with pros and cons, and their usability depends on the types of systems between
    which one wishes to achieve interoperability; this requires organizations to be
    aware of all three approaches before choosing one. ![](image-dc5zxhgw.jpg) Figure
    10.2: Approaches for Blockchain interoperability Approach 1: Cross-authentication Three
    technical methods for interoperability exist within the cross-authentication approach:  Notary
    schemes Relays Hash-locking  Notary Notary schemes are one of the simplest ways
    to achieve the full suite of cross-chain interoperability. However, they centralize
    trust, which goes against the main paradigm of blockchain, namely decentralization.
    This consequence might be acceptable in situations where blockchain consortium
    members can agree on a central party to operate the notary scheme. Relays allow
    each blockchain platform to execute transactions on its own state machine using
    the synthetic versions of assets from the other blockchain platform as relays
    allow a secure message to pass between the two platforms. For relays to work best,
    the blockchain platforms should share certain characteristics, including flexible
    multi-signature capability and fast consensus finality. This is the most practical
    technical method to interoperability in cross-authentication but is also the most
    limiting in terms of functionality, supporting only digital asset exchange. Two
    general types of hash-locking exist: on-chain hashed time-lock contracts (HTLC)
    and off-chain hashed time-lock agreements (HTLA). HTLCs allow for cross-chain
    atomic swaps and fully funded bidirectional payment channels between assets on
    certain types of blockchain platforms. Unlike HTLCs, HTLA is not built as a smart
    contract on the blockchain platform but an off-chain solution. Hence, it does
    not provide the same inbuilt decentralized characteristic as HTLC. Several companies
    have released interoperability solutions that are at varying levels of maturity. ![](image-bewsxu1l.jpg) Figure
    10.3: Interoperability solutions released by multiple companies and mapped out
    according to the three technical methods presented above Approach 2: API Gateway An
    application programming interface (API) is a piece of code that governs the access
    point to a server and the rules developers must follow to interact with an external
    database, software tool or programming language. An API gateway organizes several
    APIs. It is the conductor that organizes the requests being processed by the underlying
    architecture to simplify the experience for the user or the process of requesting
    for a client. Though API approach is tried and tested technology, it may not be
    able to guarantee the data consistency across the two blockchain platforms. Moreover,
    it centralizes the trust to whoever operates the APIs. Approach 3: Oracles An
    oracle is an agent that enables the transfer of external data to the blockchain
    for on-chain use. This is done using smart contracts that add information about
    real-world events to the blockchain. Oracles do not create actual blockchain-to-blockchain
    interoperability; they make blockchains interoperable only with non-blockchain
    systems. To assist organizations in making decisions in interoperability approaches,
    the following introduces three types of systems to connect to, and four types
    of consortia as the business context for interoperability needs. ![](image-qwn8ul8a.jpg) Figure
    10.4: Four context-dependent approaches to blockchain interoperability Convergence
    of Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) The convergence
    of blockchain, IoT, and AI have the potential to redefine the way businesses,
    industries, and even economies function, way more than they are already doing.
    This facilitates the sharing of information and drives more widespread adoption
    in different domains like Supply chain, Insurance, Autonomous Vehicle etc. The
    inevitable convergence of blockchain, IoT, and AI can form an impactful combination
    of security, interconnectivity, and autonomy to revolutionize the way things are
    done. Blockchain alone will not solve business problems. Integrated solutions
    will. 90%+ of blockchain projects are weaving in other emerging technologies,
    especially IoT and AI. No single organization owns the entire customer experience,
    and competitors and peers need to figure out how to collaborate. Blockchain in
    combination with emerging technologies like IoT and AI will provide the way to
    make it happen. Once the Blockchain Consortium is in production stage, they start
    working towards eco-system extension, Interconnectivity and then Platform Enhancement.
    It is during the Platform enhancement stage when the other technologies like IOT
    and AI will be looked into. ![](image-n45b9nxe.jpg) Figure 10.5: Blockchain +IoT+
    AI led disruption AI could be employed in large-scale blockchain platforms to
    make the platforms themselves smarter. In a global, blockchain-based supply chain
    platform, for example, an AI could monitor the platform to detect patterns and
    anomalies, potentially isolating bottlenecks or discovering safety issues faster
    than humans can. This could help fight fraud and increase safety, as well as help
    increase efficiencies and support better contingency management. Blockchain and
    AI could also help secure blockchain-based financial services platforms in the
    AML/CFT process by tracing transactions and trying to detect AML/CFT risks. In
    the real world, especially in large-scale use cases, blockchain, AI and IoT are
    likely to work in concert. In a smart city, blockchain could be combined with
    IoT and AI on an infrastructure level to manage critical systems that cities depend
    upon, as well as improve quality of life for residents through safer and better
    designed urban environments. TradeLens also uses artificial intelligence (AI),
    Internet of Things (IoT), and analytics technologies to help companies move and
    track goods digitally across borders. Blockchain Consortiums in the Insurance
    domain are using AI and IOT to reimagine the conventional business and operating
    models, spanning key functions such as underwriting, claim settlement and customer
    service. Key Learnings for the Future Consortium participants ![](image-u29pooaf.jpg) Figure
    10.6: Key Learning for the Future Consortiums  Technology and Enterprise agnosticism It
    is of utmost importance that the consortium be flexible and capable of technological
    interoperability. The blockchain environment is still in its infancy, and its
    methods are developing rapidly, even as they are deployed. While many consortia
    may align well with one technology and work well with it, the consortium should
    be flexible and fluent enough to entertain other technologies. Also, once the
    consortium has formed as a legal entity, the consortium’s senior leadership team
    should not be holding any other full-time position at an industry competitive
    organisation Participants in the consortium should also be diverse and represent
    different blockchain protocols and technologies, as well as various industry competitors
    and participants. Furthermore, any technology vendor lock-in without interoperability,
    and potential stack integration issues where solutions are designed to operate
    only with one technology platform or vendor at the cost of platform flexibility,
    is a serious risk. To reduce this risk, it is imperative to ensure representation
    and participation across platforms alongside interoperability measures and universally
    applicable data standards. Notably, when blockchain consortium working groups
    are formed and led by a single major player in the industry, confidence can be
    easily undermined and unity lost if that major player in the industry dominates
    the group. So, it is likely a group will organise around a dominant protocol and
    may even a dominant vendor. Such protocols are usually not yet flexible or interoperable.
    Thus far, organizations are failing to achieve recognition and buy-in from industry
    when organized in this way. Care must be taken in predicting how interoperability
    and standards operate to build robust solutions and groups. Onboarding of Regulators
    & Academics To ensure compliance with the blockchain consortium’s activities and
    their using best practices for achieving the common goal, it is recommended that
    consortium members involve representatives from regulatory, civil, and academic
    bodies, especially when the group is formed by a regulated industry. Regulators
    should be consulted, but they do not need to be a direct member of the working
    community. Selection of experienced Consortium Leader as an Independent Director Ideally
    the appointed consortium leader as an independent director should leave his or
    her current job in the industry to work exclusively on the consortium if possible
    and applicable. This establishes a level of market neutrality that would not be
    achievable if he or she remained associated with one organization in particular.
    The industry wide adopted best practice of appointing a neutral independent director
    affords the following possibilities, which are invaluable to a new consortium:  Provides
    the consortium with legitimacy both within the industry and with the blockchain
    ecosystem at large Leverages the director’s network to bring in fellow industry
    participants Provides expertise and guidance on initial use cases Role of a Neutral
    Convenor Many blockchain consortiums in the early stages had involved neutral
    convenor, generally a third-party organization to act as a glue for mobilizing
    collaboration among other competing organizations. For example, the MOBI consortium
    worked with the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to play this
    nexus role, and Energy Web partnered with the Rocky Mountain Institute. This could
    be particularly important during a consortium’s early days, when antitrust policies
    are still being worked through. Early on also, having a “bridge” offers a neutral
    meeting venue for the new group to brainstorm. However, it is not a prerequisite. Gather
    Critical Mass before the launch It is beneficial to gather a strong group of industry
    and blockchain leaders before the consortium is officially and publicly launched.
    If the group is too big it won’t be considered workable. There is a fine line
    however and gathering critical mass along with a well-organized advertising campaign
    to announce the launch, is vital to creating the ecosystem ‘s reputation quickly.
    This will draw potential participants and help the project community gain real
    momentum. Establish a foundational Use Case The committee or working group may,
    where appropriate, anchor its efforts and vision to create a PoC, pilot, research
    study, or standards document for an initial use case whose importance is widely
    recognized. This helps to test the importance and effectiveness of the initial
    working group and collaborative structure, provide a consistent example both externally
    and internally, and to guide initial focus. Develop strong anti-trust & governance
    policies Legal experts and advisors should develop policies and include buy-in
    from the participants to ensure that they meet all needs. In addition, a review
    should be undertaken to determine if there are regulatory barriers that can be
    overcome through government permits. If so, be ready to proceed on that front. Enterprise
    representatives evangelize in-house Usually, one or two individuals from each
    company will represent the organization in consortium meetings and working groups
    in the consortium. This person is a representative and interlocutor on behalf
    of that organisation, representing its interests and giving importance to the
    working group from that organization Reference: Blockchain and Consortiums-A comprehensive
    Handbook by Varun Singhi, Murthy Chitlur and Srinivas MahankaliCHAPTER 11 Implementation
    of Blockchain projects by Governments In this chapter, we shall study the use
    of Blockchain platform in providing e-Governance services and the steps required
    by Governments to implement such platforms. Blockchain in E-Governance Governments
    offer a number of services to various groups of businesses and citizens and also
    interact with other Governments. There are a number of departments in the Government
    which interact directly and also collaboratively with other departments to offer
    their services. The paper Consortium blockchain for security and privacy-preserving
    in e-government systems by Elisa, N., Yang, L., Li, H., Chao, F. & Naik, N. (2019)
    provides a simple but comprehensive view of a Blockchain based e-Governance system
    that can be considered for implementation. The choice of the platform could however
    be decided based on a number of site/situation specific issues like the transaction
    through put & latency specification, choice of consensus protocol etc. These services
    are categorized as follows: Government to Citizens G2C is the interaction between
    citizens and government via government web portals Government to Business G2B
    involves communication between the government and business partners or other corporate
    organisations to share information such as procurements, company registration
    and payment for licenses and taxes Government to its Employees G2E can be referred
    to as intra-government communication concerned with the sharing of the documents
    among employees of the government. Government to Government G2G is the interactions
    with other governments as well as the internal communication between government
    agencies or department by following the established rules governing public services
    delivery. While the tremendous proliferation of Information Technology systems
    has dramatically improved the efficiency of Government systems in providing transparent
    governance to their constituents, they are also prone to a number of limitations. Government
    departments provide services through access points like web and mobile to their
    citizens. They are prone to various types of cyber security threats and also suffer
    from the possibility of ‘Single Point of Failure’ of their backend storage and
    systems. History is replete with examples of data breaches that stole the citizen
    data and the transactional information, with even the occurrence of falsification
    of asset ownership information, a number of times. During 2019, data pertaining
    to about 300 properties in the Karnataka (State in India)’s Kaveri portal was
    allegedly compromised when some errant officials with technical expertise had
    misused the portal. This led to the falsification of asset ownership information
    of a number of land records. Data breaches of identity information pertaining
    to citizens in India and China is well known. Blockchain platform offers an excellent
    solution to a transparent and efficient e-Governance, eliminating Single points
    of failure while derisking the Governments form the loss of precious information. A
    consortium based Blockchain platform that connects all the various stake holders
    and all the Government departments, can facilitate instant validated transactions
    in a secure and private manner. ![](image-pnkat9xg.jpg) Figure 11.1: Network participants
    in a Consortium e-Government Blockchain Individuals and transacting businesses
    will be offered a Unique Blockchain based ID (UDID-Unique Digital Identity) for
    accessing all their services from their mobile devices or a desk top device, through
    an integrated Government portal. The respective departments validate the credentials
    of the citizens and authorise transactions that are committed to the Blockchain
    ledger. To protect privacy of the transactions and also to ensure that the Blockchain
    ledger is not overwhelmed with bulk, immutable data in a short time, data is stored
    in a ledger data base of the respective department with appropriate replication,
    while the hashes of the data are stored on a replicated data base across the Blockchain
    nodes. A decentralised system comprising of pre-authorised selected nodes approved
    by the Government can handle the Permissioned consensus mechanism and also ensure
    that only authorised departments and identified citizens conduct the transactions
    on the e-Governance Blockchain The following figure depicts the various layers
    of a e-Governance Blockchain. ![](image-6n61ccmx.jpg) Figure 11.2: Different Layers
    in a e-Government Consortium Blockchain  Service Access Layer: The purpose of
    this layer is to enable the delivery of various services to the citizens by the
    various Government departments. The user registration process consists of generating
    a unique PKI based identity after checking the citizen credentials and a unique
    Public key with a corresponding Private key is generated to identify the user.
    The user is provided a wallet that can be stored on his/her device through which
    they can identify themselves and also store their identity & credential related
    information along with the status of the assets they own as per the current state
    of the e-Governance Blockchain. The citizens will be registered and provided a
    unique common Blockchain based identity to consume and interact with the respective
    departments through APIs. Citizens can access the integrated e-Governance services
    portal vide devices like smart phones, PCs, laptops etc. They can connect, interact
    and store immutable transaction meta data as per pre-configured smart contracts.
    Sensitive, Private and Bulk data of the respective departments will be stored
    in off-chain. Transaction details of all the details are also stored on the e-Governance
    consortium server to facilitate backup and retrieval in case the user loses the
    access to the wallet on his/her device for any reason. Consortium Blockchain Layer:
    The purpose of this layer is to facilitate a collaborative governance of the e-Governance
    platform by facilitating collective validations of transactions of the transactions
    by users, through pre-approved consensus algorithms. All departments of the Government
    that offer services to different users are pre-authorised by the administrators
    of the platform and are given a PKI based identity with Public Keys and Private
    keys that allows them to approve & sign the transactions pushed into the Blockchain. Thus,
    only Permissioned users are authorised to take part in the transaction validation
    & block creation process, while the updated status of the Blockchain is broadcasted
    to all the consortium participants who are keeping track of the ledger. The transactions
    thus approved are immutable recorded on the Blockchain offering verifiability,
    integrity and non-repudiation, leading to transparency and citizen satisfaction.
    Users can retrieve and review their transaction status and record any time by
    using the Blockchain explorer. Network Layer: The Purpose of the Network layer
    is to connect all the participants, different layers and corresponding storage
    stations in the Consortium Blockchain electronically by using appropriate technologies
    like Wi-Fi, Ethernet LAN, cellular network & Wireless Broad Band networks etc.
    Adequate safeguards like Firewalls, Militarized zones and HSM devices are used
    to protect the networks across various premises, VMs, devices, VPNs, cloud etc.,
    to ward of any potential security threats and challenges. Ledger Storage Layer:
    The purpose of this layer is storing the credential information of the users required
    to validate them before undertaking transactions and also store a large amount
    of department specific data that cannot be stored on Blockchain ledger due to
    privacy and storage considerations. The integrity of the data is authenticated
    by comparing the hash of the presented data for a specific record at any point
    with the hash of the corresponding data stored on the Blockchain, while the actual
    records are stored in the Ledger storage layer. This layer also allows the compliance
    of the e-Governance platform with respect to the data privacy laws like GDPR by
    allowing deletion & revocation when warranted. This layer is provided the necessary
    safeguards like replication, high level security and firewalls to ensure isolation
    from malicious actors. Steps to implement Blockchain platform development by Governments: Blockchain
    being a new paradigm meaning a lot of connotations to different segments of the
    population, a step-by-step approach has to be considered for going through the
    planning and implementation phases. Several risk factors spanning across Technological,
    Operational and Regulatory domains need to be considered and factored in. In this
    chapter we shall understand the various factors and stages of a Blockchain project
    and also point to the relevant resources which are a must to master for any Blockchain
    practitioner. It has happened a few times that, as the projects progressed in
    real life and after the pilots have been successfully demonstrated, legal issues
    arose challenging the legality of the Blockchain platform & solution implemented
    with mistaken notions concerning the Privacy of the data of participants or the
    eligibility of the implementing parties with respect to the propriety of their
    involvement in developing solution while taking part in the Governance at the
    same time. In this case, it must be ensured that there is clear demonstration
    of the objective nature of governing the platform to ensure no meddling with the
    encoded logic in the smart contracts. The various aspects discussed are summarised
    as follows:  Preliminary study and discussions to assess the utility of the Blockchain
    /Distributed Ledger Technology to the domain specific use cases. Conduct design
    thinking workshops to understand the problems in the as-is situation, study the
    processes and improvements required & possible in the desired to-be scenario,
    conduct gap analysis and plan the solution by leveraging Blockchain. Getting an
    idea (rough estimate) of the budget that can be allotted for the Project in line
    with the capacity of the sponsoring organisation or the department/ team behind
    the project. Creating a DPR (Detailed Project Report) outlining the various aspects
    of the project in a detailed manner with respect to the planning and design of
    the solution. Detailed solution architecture and technology stack has to be designed
    and laid out along with the suggested implementation methodology & the associated
    risks to be mitigated. Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) are the outputs of planning
    and design phase of a project. DPR is a very detailed and elaborate plan for a
    project indicating overall programme, different roles and responsibilities, activities
    and resources required for the project Creating a Request for Proposal (RFP) for
    various prospective competent solution providers and system integrators to submit
    their bids to implement the solution to the expectation of the client as per the
    terms laid out. Bid management and selection of the right System integrators who
    can execute the project. Program Management, Capacity building and Change management
    to ensure that the solution is correctly implemented and delivered with a proper
    monitoring system in place are the other major steps which have to be executed
    in a detailed manner. At every stage a thorough testing across all dimensions
    like regression testing, integration testing, User acceptance testing must be
    conducted and bugs taken carefully. DEVOPS methodology that stresses Continuous
    delivery and continuous integration enables a smooth project execution that minimises
    risk and overall costs. For interesting reports on implementation of Blockchain

    a Public permissioned platform anchored at Chennai, India, has created a functional
    reference model for Government Blockchain that can be depicted as in the following
    diagram. ![](image-u7xwnns7.jpg) Figure 11.7: Integrated & simplistic view of
    a Government Blockchain platform (Courtesy Adhi Chain, India) Since different
    departments have different legacy systems with their own specific data formats,
    it is imperative that, Blockchain platform offers a facility for the respective
    department by the use of an Adapter that converts the legacy data format to a
    format (example JSON, Xml etc.) that can interact with the Blockchain. This can
    be done in 2 ways:  Blockchain platforms issues a standardised data format to
    the various partners pushing/consuming the data through APIs. This imposes a need
    for the respective departments/ organisations to build their own adapters and
    communicate with the Blockchain Nodes. Blockchain platform offers a customised
    adapter to each and every partner that enables seamless communication. The following
    diagram depicts the schematic approach of the communication through an adapter
    service for data compatibility and interoperability with the legacy systems and
    the same can be extended to the interactions across different platforms as well. ![](image-tjf0nwlv.jpg) Figure
    11.8: Adapters facilitate seamless interoperability between backend systems Depending
    on the privacy requirements, the following are the options available to store
    the data in the form of a ‘meta data’ or its hash encrypted format. ![](image-wdlkp8yz.jpg) Figure
    11.9: Data store options to meet Privacy requirements Some of the documents that
    can be digitised and stored on the Blockchain platform operated by the Government
    can be as follows:  Aadhaar card, a biometric, digital and physical identity system. Indian
    passport Overseas Passport Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) issued by the
    Election Commission of India Overseas Citizenship of India document Person of
    Country Origin Card Permanent account number (PAN) card (income tax) Driving licence
    issued by the states Ration card issued by the Government of India Identity Certificate
    for non-citizens or stateless people Proof of Marriage document issued by the
    Registrar Legal Name Change Certificate Birth certificate issued by the Registry
    of Births and Deaths (RBD) or from a Municipality within the provisions of the
    RBD Act Policy Bond issued by Public Life Insurance Corporations/Companies Community
    certificates Freedom Fighter Identity Cards Arms Licenses Property Documents such
    as Pattas, Registered Deeds etc. Gas Connection Bill Bank/ Farmer/ Post Office

    provided wallets to store their assets and credentials. A typical Blockchain platform
    comes with the following minimum components for offering Trust as a service to
    the various applications anchored on it. ![](image-zjmlg3x1.jpg) Figure 11.10:
    Blockchain Platform components for a holistic solution delivery In the coming
    chapter, we shall examine how some of the leading global countries are encouraging
    the adoption of Blockchain in their countries through the creation of a friendly
    regulatory and technology patronising environment that lets the disruptive technologies
    take wings in offering the beneficial impact to the citizens. Creating a Detailed
    Project Report for a Blockchain Project It is said that 90% of the project fail
    due to improper planning. Hence before we embark on any project, a detailed architecture
    and a comprehensive road map needs to be created with attention to minute details.
    As discussed earlier, Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) are the outputs of planning
    and design phase of a project. DPR is a very detailed and elaborate plan for a
    project indicating overall programme, different roles and responsibilities, activities
    and resources required for the project. An excellent resource to understand the
    various phases of Blockchain implementation is provided by American Council for
    Technology-Industry Advisory Council at https://blockchain-working-group.github.io/blockchain-playbook/phases/4/ ![](image-02x15wwn.jpg) Figure
    11.11: Blockchain implementation Playbook (ACT IAC) The following are the key
    components of a DPR for a Blockchain Project.  Objective of the Project: It is
    very important to have a clear understanding of and communication about the reason
    behind the project. 5W &1H, the approach that describes the ‘Why What, For Whom,
    Where & When should be described in clear detail with shared understanding between
    all the stake holders. Understand and analyse the Stakeholders: A thorough analysis
    of the various stakeholders operating in the ecosystem along with their interactions
    with the Blockchain platform & motivations for change must be documented. Analysis
    and insights from this stage have a bearing on the solution design and feasibility. Project
    Implementation Strategy. Once the DPR is approved, Government and PSU organisations
    undertake a standardised methodology for executing large scale project. The phases
    of the project along with their expected timelines should be outlined to arrive
    at a proper effort estimate. The phases that have to be planned are as follows:  Create
    a Request for proposal and invite vendors to quote Conduct Pre-bid meetings to
    clarify and correct errors. Check the technical competence through demonstrable
    Proof of Concepts. Select the right vendor partner/consortium for awarding the
    contract & onboard the same. Execute the project by overseeing the implementation
    of the vendor partner from design stage to final testing & roll out. Roll out
    the Pilot in a limited scope and ensure its adherence to the requirements. Scale
    out the project and complete the execution at full scale successfully. This is
    the major phase that generally takes 50% of the total time. At every stage the
    prerequisites for the stage and activities during the stage need to be mapped
    out in detail. Functional Solution The functional solution is the heart of the
    entire project. It lays out exactly what, the system is expected to deliver. It
    involves detailing the data models corresponding to the actors, the assets and
    their ownership, the processes that are undertaken for the state changes that
    need to be represented in the Smart contract applications. All the various modules
    corresponding to the various applications along with the requirement of their
    user interaction/ user interfaces & the corresponding functionalities need to
    be understood and outlined clearly. Identity Management Identity management will
    involve the ways in which the participants are identified in the Blockchain platform. The
    access, authentication and authorisation particulars of the various participants
    and the corresponding processed through the transactions are undertaken by them
    are outlined in detail. In general, the identity of the participants is established
    through a three-factor approach that takes into account what they are (Unique
    National Identity like Aadhar), Biometric details like Iris, fingerprint), what
    that possess (card with details embedded in a chip) and what they know (one-time
    Pin). Blockchain offers a full proof identity establishment with the help of PKI
    based authentication, multifactor authentication and digital signature-based message
    authentications to fix accountability, integrity of data and non-repudiation.
    This has crucial implications for the utility of Blockchain platforms. Change
    Management Blockchain being one of the latest paradigms that offers a paradigm
    shift in the way we approach business transactions; it is bound to trigger a lot
    of scepticism and resistance to change. To overcome this, there is a need to educate
    and bring on board all key stakeholders & the users of the system. Lucid lessons
    and training material coupled with benefits explained to all the participants
    will go a long way in effecting the change management smoothly. Hence capability
    building is a key component and must involve all concerned parties in the ecosystem
    and those involved in the project implementation. This is a prerequisite for project
    success and is a key component of DPR. Governance Structure Blockchain is adopted
    for its role in creating trusted and transparent transactions. The transactions
    between multiple parties in the ecosystem are recorded permanently. Blockchain
    is governed by a Network governing committee composed of cross functional leaders
    & other responsible representatives, to collectively take a call on the participant
    additions and deletions as well as changes to the contract structures. Many times,
    consortiums fail due to the partisan approach of the governing team or wrong decisions
    and misgivings. The following teams form the various elements of governance that
    need to be carefully identified and managed.  Network governance team that involves
    all the leaders and provides the regulatory & audit oversight as required to ensure
    compliance, Platform implementation sponsoring team, that helps in getting the
    necessary budget support and financial clearances required for execution Project
    management team that ensures effective delivery and monitoring across the various
    phases of execution and Functional team comprising teams taking care of application
    development & monitoring, technology, security, partner management. Operations
    Management Operations management involves taking care of all the issues during
    the functioning of the application and the platform operation. While care is taken
    to ensure that there are minimum errors and failures possible through different
    types of testing before releasing, any issues that are springing up anytime should
    be logged and monitored for satisfactory closure as per SLAs. Appropriate software,
    monitoring, reporting and logging tools and Helpdesk with 24 by 7 capability to
    record, address the issues through a systematic escalation mechanism must be planned
    for. To ensure security, it is important to consider Security by Design and implement
    proper firewalls, VPNs and HSM modules etc., to adhere to Confidentiality, Integrity
    and Availability all times. Technical Design: This involves:  High level design
    showcasing the interactions between various layers of the system viz., Blockchain
    layer & Data layer, Business logic layer and the Presentation layer. Access control
    for participants and security aspects Details of On-chain & off-chain applications
    and data elements, Smart contracts for each process flow and the detailed functionality
    of each of them. Different nodes and their quantity & design elements like size,
    location, role etc., for various levels of implementation Transaction Estimates The
    type of Blockchain application and the use case decides the throughput and maximum
    latency expectation. The Blockchain platform and the hardware impose the capability
    of the system to handle the same. Hence it is extremely important to have a clear
    understanding of the volume and the size of the transactions expected to be handled
    by the system in a 1-year time frame that can be deduced to the level where it
    can be used to compare with the corresponding handling capacity of the platform.
    For example, Permissionless platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin are tremendously
    limited by their capacity in handling the enterprise requirements in most cases.
    Hence Permissioned applications are the way to go for G2C or G2B applications. Risk
    Management Large scale IT projects that involve huge investments are susceptible
    to different types of risks that can jeopardise the returns on investment. Hence
    a proper assessment of the different types of risks and the corresponding mitigating
    mechanisms must be factored in, without which the DPR is assumed to be complete. Technological
    and Operational risks, external risks and regulatory risks have to be factored
    in and taken care, while planning for the Blockchain Projects. Final Project Estimates. The
    cost estimate for the project factors in all the elements considered above. A
    typical output of a Detailed Project Report offers the estimate based on all the
    functional and non-functional requirements and the respective volume estimates
    and assumes the following heads:  Effort towards the development of the various
    application elements including smart contracts and their integration with the
    front-end various modules as explained earlier. Cost of hosting nodes and the
    various hardware elements including the application and web servers and all other
    associated paraphernalia. Cost of HSM/ VPN/ Firewall/ Security/ Racks/ Data centre
    Infrastructure Maintenance cost and operational expenses including IoT devices,
    gateways, QR codes, Active/ Passive RFID tags etc. Detailed estimate of Training
    and Capability building required to onboard all stakeholders till final implementation. Most
    of the times, Government projects require definitive costing for budgeting instead
    of on a pay per unit or pay per use model, that is normally preferred for private
    sector players. Though a number of the above costs could be fixed in nature depending
    on the volume estimates, some of the costs like hardware or platform licenses
    and that of packaged software and their maintenance could be costed on variable
    basis and has to be appropriately budgeted. The next steps involve creation of
    RFP (Request for Proposal) through the various stages leading to the final implementation. World
    Economic Forum has come out with a suggested model RFP template that is well described
    in the documents available at the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p_vwXfbFOdABYmrGOIlcGXrv7AcNM_KI/view?usp=sharing
    (mail atCHAPTER 12 Designing a Blockchain Project-Case study Puducherry Government
    wants to implement Blockchain based solution for transparently managing the distribution
    of its Civil supplies to beneficiaries who are qualified citizens. They have requested
    Civil chain company to design a solution for the project. Here is briefly how,
    they go about it. Civil supplies play crucial role in upliftment of the society.
    Civil Supplies Department is entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that
    ration and other social benefits as directed by the Government reaches the intended
    customers. Increasing government schemes demand for transparency in the civil
    supply chains. Civil supply chains involve dozens of personnel and hundreds of
    interactions with high probabilities for human error and mismanagement. Blockchain
    technology promises to improve traceability and transparency within the civil
    value chains. Blockchain technology has the potential to make civil supply chains
    more secure, transparent and efficient. It promises end to end supply chain visibility
    and allows to trace the origin of a produce (provenance) and track a product/produce
    during its journey in a supply chain. In this chapter, we propose blockchain based
    supply chain tracking and tracing solution which can help in improving efficiency
    and effectiveness of the current civil supply value chain.  Understanding the
    process: Currently Civil Supply value chain involves the following process: Food
    Producer or Merchant transports the commodity/product to the Warehouse via Transporter Warehouse
    transports the commodity/product the retail ration shop Beneficiary buys the commodity/product
    at subsidized price ![](image-aojfp17c.jpg) Figure 12.1: Understanding the Civil
    supplies Supply Chain  Defining the Problems and understanding the pain points
    in the value chain: Civil supply value chain’s efficiency and effectiveness decreases
    due to the following issues:  Lack of coordination across multiple, disbursed
    and often disconnected supply chain actors like suppliers, transporters, warehouses,
    ration agents etc. Lack of consistent data and digital capabilities making sharing
    of information across the Supply chain difficult. Onerous and costly data reconciliation
    processes Lack of product/commodity traceability Manipulation of information stored
    in the records. For e.g., subsidy information etc. Injection of counterfeit or
    substandard commodity/product in the supply chain. Analyzing the proposed solution
    requirements and describing the same: Solution Objectives: Digitize all the transactions
    taking place in the entire Civil Supply Value Chain Track commodity/product from
    point of purchase to the point of sale at ration shops Tamper proof and single
    source of truth for all the transactions & product’s/commodity’s attributes throughout
    the Civil supply chain Time stamp each transaction in the supply chain Near Real
    time audit of the system and the processes Components of the Solution architecture
    are as follows: The solution development considers the following:  Data model:
    It is important to clearly identify the different data elements that are a part
    of the entire lifecycle tracking of the assets and transactions. The identities
    of the actors, things being tracked, their roles must be tracked with the following
    elements:  ID of the element, Description of the element Information capsule about
    the element - that undergoes additions, deletions and state changes due to the
    transactions being conducted through the triggering of the smart contracts at
    various points. Types of transactions and the corresponding resultant states of
    the objects participating in the transaction along with the transaction IDs are
    key data element to be tracked in the Blockchain. The solution architecture incorporates
    the following views:  Case View: Case view tracks the different sequences of activities,
    their corresponding actors & their respective roles. Logical view: Logical vie
    takes a look at the various stages, packages and steps in the process of development.
    This gives a clarity of the overall requirements of the system being developed. Process
    view: Process view offers a detailed look at the different processes that need
    to be configured in the form of smart contracts and their description. Deployment
    view: Deployment view involves the depiction of the various hardware and middleware
    that enable us to launch the application securely. The various nodes, security
    and networking elements and their interaction is depicted in this view. Implementation
    View: Implementation view provides the overview of the different options for implementing
    the technology and the advantages and disadvantages thereof. In this book are
    focusing on the elements concerning the designing of the solution. For more details
    on the implementation aspects refer to the Blockchain implementation playbook

    implementing the above process flow on a Blockchain platform, the following layers
    are required. Front end layer: This is required for participants to interact with
    the Blockchain system and other application components as per their access control
    terms. After an analysis of various Blockchain platforms with respect to the characteristics
    of the scenario depicted, it has been felt that a Public Permissioned implementation
    with Hyperledger Fabric is the best fit for the given use case. The Web/mobile
    interface will be used for the purposes of the front-end layer; however, the same
    would have to incorporate the following (detailed would be determined as per the
    integration requirement gathering during implementation) :  Separate web/mobile
    interface for Procurement Department Separate web/mobile interface for Warehouse Separate
    web interface for Transporters Separate web interface for Ration shops The Blockchain
    layer consists of the following components: Blockchain network will be created
    with following properties:  Network set up for Nodes : Admin node to be hosted
    by the Civil Supplies Department Node for warehouse department Representational
    node for transporters to be hosted by the Civil Supplies Department Representational
    node for ration shops to be hosted by the Civil Supplies Department Wallets for
    all the participants in the network. All interactions between participants will
    happen through their wallets. Permissioned Ledger. Only participants approved
    by the admin will be permitted on the network. Smart Contracts Implementation

    the following: The proposed system will be maintained by firewall to filter out
    the invalid requests. Load Load balancer redirects the incoming requests based
    on the load on the corresponding web servers Presentation Layer contains the web
    and mobile interfaces Application Server Layer of the proposed solution contains
    the following components: ![](image-sho8mui0.jpg) Table 12.3: Application Components The
    Blockchain Layer of the proposed solution contains the following components. ![](image-7nox0qas.jpg) Table
    12.4: Key components of Blockchain Layer To implement the above components, we
    need to configure the following elements of the solution architecture and shown
    in figure 7.3 viz depicting the deployment view. ![](image-2hazs0js.jpg) Figure
    12.3: Deployment view of the Solution architecture The technology stack for the
    above infrastructure architecture is as given in the following table. ![](image-lerp4mjz.jpg) Table
    12.5: Technology components of the Blockchain based solution For the given use
    case, the details of the specifications of the technology components can be summarised
    as follows: ![](image-desy2jiu.jpg) Table 12.6: Hardware sizing and specifications Security
    Aspects of the Proposed Solution Architecture of the proposed solution supports
    the following features to enhance security performance: Permissioned blockchain:
    Identities joining the network must be approved by the network administrator.
    It is always advisable to create a policy for admitting new members in the network.
    Also, network members have to approve for any change in network configuration
    or to deploy smart contract. Privacy & Proposed solution make use of Hyperledger
    Fabric which ensures data privacy and confidentiality with following features: Channels
    are sub networks within the larger blockchain network for scoping and data isolation.
    Ledger & smart contracts maintained within a channel can only be accessed by the
    members of that channel. Channel private data allows for finer security within
    the channel by allowing data access to selected few members within the channel.
    In such cases, the blocks on the ledger only contain hashes of such data, while
    the private data is stored off the ledger in a private state database. The hashes
    on the public ledger serve as verifiable proof of the data. Data can be hashed
    or encrypted before calling smart contract. Data access to some participants can
    be restricted by defining access control in the smart contract logic Data stored
    in the ledgers of peers can be encrypted via file system encryption on the peer All
    communication between different nodes is encrypted via Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) Identity Management: The system makes use of industry standards for digital
    identities i.e., X.509 certificates. At its core Hyperledger Fabric is public
    key infrastructure (PKI) system. Certificate Authority is responsible for registering
    new users to the network and issue them X.509 certificates. Membership Service
    Provider (MSP) manages the access management for different identities in the Fabric
    application. Transaction integrity: Propose solution uses cryptographic techniques
    to prevent transaction tampering. Data security: Data is arranged in blocks and
    blocks are linked with previous blocks using hash pointers. Thus, data stored
    on blockchain ledgers are cryptographically secured by design. Smart contract
    security: In Fabric smart contracts or Chaincode are installed on peers and explicitly
    initiated. When initiated, each Chaincode runs in a separate and isolated environment
    called Docker container. In Fabric, an operator can configure a policy to disable
    all outgoing or incoming network traffic on the Chaincode Docker containers, except
    white-listed nodes. Security Risk Assessment of the Proposed solution Following
    table summarizes common security threats and how a Blockchain based solution mitigates
    the same. ![](image-ht5bdw5a.jpg) Table 12.7: Security threats as addressed by
    a Blockchain based system It is now time to take a look at the Implementation
    view. The proposed solution is planned to be implemented in 14 weeks as depicted
    in the following Gantt Chart. These needs to finetuned further once detailed scoping
    and solution discussions are undertaken and the final deployment plan emerges. The
    implementation schedule also allows the implementation partner to estimate the
    effort and quote for the final budget requirement to implement the project. ![](image-ymwg89i9.jpg) Figure
    12.4: Gantt chart depicting the tentative implementation timelines As we can observe
    from the above chart, best approach is to use the Agile methodology involving
    a series of short sprints. Implementation of an end-to-end blockchain solution
    involves engineering both the infrastructure solution and the application solution
    that runs on top of the infrastructure solution. The infrastructure solution involves
    heavy investments and it cannot easily be changed. The architecture should be
    modular, reusable, and extendible options whenever possible. Given the rapid transformation
    in the blockchain technology space, what works today may become a significant
    burden or even obsolete in 3-5 years. In that sense, rapid prototyping with constant
    iterations is the preferred way of implementing blockchain solutions. During the
    Implementation Phase, you should use a systems-engineering approach to further
    refine the detailed design and architecture of the blockchain solution. This may
    involve evaluating and making or refining decisions regarding at least some of
    the following:  Choice of the development platform, technology stack, tools ecosystem. Commercial
    of the shelf versus in-house. Open Source versus proprietary solution. Cloud,
    on-premises, or a hybrid deployment architecture. As-a-Service solution. Network
    architecture and network registries. Business process flows. Consensus algorithms. Design
    of blocks, distributed ledger databases, data. Design of transactions. Design
    of smart contracts. User interface/user experience design. Leverage machine learning,
    artificial intelligence. Interoperability with legacy and third-party systems/data. Privacy. Rules
    and policy engine. Cross-blockchain architecture and interoperability. Non-functional
    requirements. Agile and DevOps methodologies are highly recommended for the project
    management approach. Included in that is the management of the scope for your
    blockchain solution implementation. Agile development provides an iterative roadmap
    where implementation is done in small increments. Achieving incremental gains
    satisfies stakeholders while enabling you to strategically scale so that you can
    optimally address pain points, while tackling one priority area at a time, to
    ultimately accomplish transformational objectives and advance mission goals. (Source
    Blockchain implementation Play book-ACT-IAC) Risks and Mitigation As discussed
    earlier, Blockchain being a new paradigm that is dramatically altering the way
    we look at inter-enterprise co-operation and collaboration led digitisation, leveraging
    network effect and affecting the entire eco-system, one needs to be caution and
    plan for different risks involving Operation, technological, regulatory and external
    risks. A sample approach to estimating risks and planning for the risk mitigation
    is described in the following table. ![](image-rkcbik5f.jpg) Table 12.8: Risks
    and mitigations-A sample approach in a Blockchain project With the above approach,
    the Blockchain solution development company can provide the necessary roadmap
    to the Puducherry Government to undertake a Blockchain implementation for implementing
    a transparent Supply chain and prevent leakages, while maximizing the benefits
    to the needy citizens. In this chapter, we have taken a look at the different
    stages of Solution architecture that will enable us to architect the solution,
    take a look at its different views. Though this is a bit simplistic approach,
    the different situations call for a corresponding variation in the micro level
    components that go into estimating the final effort and the budget required for
    the Blockchain based solution being designed.CHAPTER 13 Challenges and Limitations
    of implementing Blockchain solutions Governments across the world have accelerated
    their adoption of Blockchain applications for transforming their citizen services. Different
    Governments are at different stages of adoption. We have seen Governments launch
    their strategy and approach papers. As discussed in Chapter there are a number
    of key benefits sough after by them to transform their working and present substantial
    convenience, transparency to their citizens. Blockchain being still in its early
    stage of evolution, a lot of developments that take place across the nook and
    corners of the world are seeking to mitigate these challenges as we go along. In
    January 2020, World Economic Forum presented a report that took stock of the developments
    in Blockchain adoption in UAE. It has noted that, “Blockchain has swept the UAE
    as one of the most promising technologies for digital transformation. Government
    entities, banks, telecommunications providers and academia have begun exploring
    the applications of blockchain at an unprecedented rate. The results have been
    staggering, in both the public and private sectors – with more than 40 government
    entities and 120 blockchain companies covering 200-plus initiatives.” Some of
    the challenges that we face in implementing the Blockchain based applications
    are summarised in the following figure: ![](image-sd1zndth.jpg) Figure 13.1: Key
    challenges faced while implementing Blockchain applications The Centre for the
    Fourth Industrial Revolution UAE surveyed over 100 stakeholders from more than
    60 various governmental and non-governmental entities across the country actively
    exploring or implementing blockchain. The primary purpose of the survey was to
    understand the maturity of the ecosystem and the relevant challenges and key success
    factors at hand. The following figure provided by the WEF report summarises the
    key challenges faced while implementing Blockchain based solutions by various
    stake holders. ![](image-o2csf18m.jpg) Figure 13.2: Key Challenges faced in Blockchain
    implementation(Source: WEF report on UAE Jan 2020) The challenges faced are as
    per the decreasing order of intensity are summarised in the following figure. ![](image-usz03xug.jpg) Figure
    13.3: Blockchain implementation ChallengesSource: Inclusive Deployment of Blockchain,
    Case studies and Learnings from UAE. Over 52% of the projects surveyed were in
    the post implementation stage and the following figure identifies the key factors
    behind the success of the various projects being implemented. ![](image-wiutook8.jpg) Figure
    13.4: Key success factors for Blockchain implementation(Source: WEF report) Since
    the regulatory concerns, unclear returns of investment, difficulty in forging
    an eco-system collaboration and lack of proper education and understanding are
    the key factors hampering the Blockchain adoption, Governments across the world
    have to come together and take proactive steps in facilitating and regulating
    the Blockchain ecosystems. They should actively participate in global initiatives
    led by United Nations, UNDP, WEF, WHO, UNICEF and such others to foster a climate
    of co-development and co-evolution that will hasten the accelerated adoption of
    Blockchain.  Increasing Exposure to global adoption use cases through government
    targeted seminars, conferences Spreading Blockchain awareness and education to
    decision makers and facilitators Stress of ow hanging fruits that facilitate quicker
    adoption Focus on Blockchain applications that require nil Legacy migrations Demonstration
    of Tangible Use cases with perceptible ROI. Proactive approach by engaging with
    Progressive Government Officials through cost-effective, low obligation Pilots. Collaborating
    with Governments to come out with white papers & practical use case studies Increasing
    engagement with Academia & collaborating to offer cutting edge & high impact but
    economical solutions to Government Subsidizing infrastructure and Proactively
    collaborating with other Government & Public sector organisations to collaborate
    with promising Start-ups, venture funds and interested organisations to help develop
    cost-effective PoCs (Proof of Concepts), Pilots with assured buy-back arrangements.CHAPTER
    14 Encouraging Blockchain adoption & Educating the new generation for adoption To
    develop applications in new generation technologies involves tremendous innovation
    and encouragement for disruptive application development orientation. Often this
    involves a lot of investment and involvement of the brightest minds to continuously
    imagine new possibilities and push the frontiers of technology and research. Start-ups
    are best placed to engage in such activities, but they need to be backed by a
    tremendous push and support from the Government. Regulatory Sandbox is a platform
    that is promoted by most of the developed and progressive countries that offers
    a lot of facilities to the start-ups to quickly develop their validated ideas
    with an added incentive of government led adoption, if they are proven to have
    a high chance of success. A regulatory sandbox is a regulatory approach, typically
    summarized in writing and published, that allows live, time-bound testing of innovations
    under a regulator’s oversight. Novel financial products, technologies, and business
    models can be tested under a set of rules, supervision requirements, and appropriate
    safeguards.  A sandbox creates a conducive and contained space where incumbents
    and challengers experiment with innovations at the edge or even outside of the
    existing regulatory framework. A regulatory sandbox brings the cost of innovation
    down, reduces barriers to entry, and allows regulators to collect important insights
    before deciding if further regulatory action is necessary. A successful test may
    result in several outcomes, including full-fledged or tailored authorization of
    the innovation, changes in regulation, or a cease-and desist order. (Reference;
    United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for
    Development briefing on Regulatory Sandbox). Let us now examine a case study of
    how Singapore, one of the leading Digital Nations and ranked the Smartest city
    in the world consistently by IMD, implements a Sandbox to encourage innovators
    to develop and launch disruptive technology-based products. Ranked #1 in the world
    for ease of doing business, Singapore has many incentives for budding entrepreneurs
    that allows the innovation to be commercialised in a speedy manner. All the entrepreneurs
    are well encouraged to propose their new ideas to a seasoned set of Public-Private
    mentor networks and the selected ideas are put through a well-designed Sand Box
    system with immense Government support, to examine viability & potential of the
    envisaged solutions. Once the ideas are proven in the Sandbox, they are immediately
    primed for implementation with the full force of Government behind them as a facilitator,
    adopter, funder, and implementer. How does the Regulatory Sandbox Work? Case study:
    Regulatory Sandbox – EMA (Energy Metering Authority, Govt of Singapore)   Regulatory
    Sandbox enables the energy sector to test new products & services in the electricity
    & gas sectors, before deciding on the appropriate regulatory treatment. This is
    designed to help the innovators to leverage on new technology or apply existing
    technology in novel ways to create value for electricity and gas consumers, or
    to improve business and operational procedures, without the risk of a major failure
    that normally stifle such innovations EMA is encouraging innovators to apply for
    such experimentation by enabling such ideas to be tested through a Regulatory
    Sandbox. A successful application would allow the idea to be applied in the market,
    while being subject to relaxed regulatory requirements, in a controlled environment
    that limits the risks to consumers and industry. The evaluation criteria for ideas
    applying for the Regulatory Sandbox include whether the proposal:  Uses technologies/products
    in an innovative way; Addresses a problem or brings benefits to consumers and/or
    the energy sector. Requires some changes to existing rules; and Has assessed and
    mitigated foreseeable risks. ![](image-n0lt652j.jpg) Figure 14.1: EMA Regulatory
    Sandbox  The Regulatory Sandbox will help EMA adjust its regulatory frameworks
    to keep pace with advances in technology and enable promising innovations to prosper. The
    Regulatory Sandbox will complement ongoing Energy Research and Development (R&D)
    initiatives, by providing a platform for R&D projects to be tested on a broader
    scale in Singapore. This system attracts the best organisations, entrepreneurs
    and investors in the World that further fuels the innovation with high quality
    and chance of success. With focus on the ABCD of today’s disruptive technologies
    namely API economy, Blockchain, Cloud & Data Analytics enveloped in a highly guarded
    Cyber security focused approach, Singapore leads in the adoption of these technologies
    towards a better quality of life for its citizens and the global population! Today
    Singapore continues to thrive, guided by the values of openness, inclusiveness,
    self-determination, meritocracy, and incorruptibility. Educating the Nation-Government’s
    role The Role of Academic Institutions in Achieving the Targets for Advanced Technologies: India
    has a very good academic structure when it comes to AI but the outcome in terms
    of innovation and Intellectual Property (IP) is on a lower side. India is not
    focusing on creating IPs or Advanced Technology products at the academic level.
    A center for excellence in this sector will be very helpful but it should be thoroughly
    monitored by government. IISc, IIT Mumbai, IIT Kanpur, IIT Patna, IIT Delhi, IIT
    Madras, some IIITs and a few central universities are leading the efforts of the
    academia in India. However, the number of research papers and patentable solutions
    developed in the Indian academic ecosystem is considered miniscule compared to
    the leading countries in the world like US, China and the D5 nations. The research
    conducted by the Indian academic institutions is hampered by the siloed approach
    and the lack of coordination between the Industry, academia, and Start-up ecosystem
    & is disjointed from the real-life situations where the difference can be perceptible.
    The number of solutions developed through the research in India; that has been
    commercialized on large scale to generate value; is dismal. This also leads to
    the reluctance of the industry and government to engage with substantial investments
    that can produce cognizable results. There should be a clear value proposition
    for the enterprises to partner with the Academia for coinvesting in developing
    disruptive technology solutions. Role of Blockchain in Digital Transformation: Distributed
    Ledger technologies like Blockchain enable risk management by offering controlled
    access, fool proof authentication and trusted authorization for those involved
    and transactions conducted between them by acting as a trusted third party. Digital
    transformation at scale can thus be expedited in a secured manner. The following
    are some of the crucial activities to be done by Government of India to support

    through Re-Skilling Realising that change is the only constant in today’s fast
    evolving world, knowledge professionals should upskill themselves to stay relevant
    in a world. Some of the activities that are suggested are outlined below:  Keep
    abreast of the latest use cases by studying the way the global leaders like Amazon,
    Netflix, Facebook, Google, JPMorgan, HSBC etc., are leveraging emerging technologies. Keep
    abreast of the tools and platforms offered by leading companies in the field like
    IBM, Google, Microsoft, Intel etc. Undertake courses on Online platforms to upskill
    on the trending topics in the emerging technologies. Study how AI/ML & Blockchain
    applications are being implemented in leading countries like China, USA, Singapore
    & Middle East. Always look proactively for opportunities to implement AI/ML solutions
    in practical scenarios while being sensitive to the way, various businesses are
    leveraging the same. Learn to be computer literate and try to pick up a language
    like Node JS, Golang or Python. Try to write articles, white papers or books that
    will force one to conduct intense research around related topics. Role of Government
    in Encouraging Skilling, Reskilling and Upskilling There is a large need to take
    care of the existing workforce that is likely to be displaced from their jobs
    due to the emerging technology led automation. Professionals have a dire need
    to re-skill & stay relevant. Hence it is imperative for the Government to put
    in place a concerted strategy to deliver appropriate competence & impart he industry
    relevant skill while encouraging the learners to master the same. It is imperative
    to partner Global leading educational/training providers and offer the highest
    quality programs that combine theoretical, practical, and cutting-edge solutioning
    capabilities to the executives across the various stages of the corporate lifecycle.  Reskilling
    should be encouraged through proper incentives and opportunity for career growth Formal
    and informal education with highest standards should be made available with proper
    standardization and recognized certification that is valued by industry. Online
    education through MOOCs should be blended with real life opportunities to explore
    and implement solutions on job. In conclusion, while it is true that COVID-19
    pandemic has resulted in a dramatic paradigm shift in the form of increased digitalisation
    & automation, times have also become very challenging due to the availability
    of multiple resources across the software development lifecycle with the proliferation
    of open-source technologies and highly secure and scalable cloud enabled SAAS
    environment. While countries like India have understood the paradigm of Smart
    Cities and Digital Governance, they have a long way to go as far as implementation
    is concerned, It is here that the examples set by countries like Estonia, Dubai
    (UAE), Singapore (which is also the Smartest city in the world) must closely studied,
    understood and evaluated for implementation. Sustainable Development is very much
    required if the world must survive into the future and we manage to handover a
    safe and secure world to our younger generations. Hence, we need to consciously
    strive to achieve Sustainable development like the way Singapore is planning 50
    years in advance and is overcoming a number of geographic limitations as well
    as resource constraints. It is indeed possible to overturn the tide of environmental
    degradation caused by industrial development and this has been stressed in every
    chapter in this book through real life examples that are in vogue.Conclusion Distributed
    Ledger technologies like Blockchain enable risk management by offering controlled
    access, fool proof authentication and trusted authorization for those involved
    and facilitate secured transactions between them by acting as a trusted third
    party. Digital transformation at scale can thus be expedited in a secured manner. The
    following are some of the crucial activities to be done by Governments to support
    path breaking applications of Distributed Ledger Technologies:  Unique Blockchain
    based self-sovereign digital identities for all citizens. Central bank digital
    currency on a national permissioned Blockchain. Regulatory recognition of data
    and transaction records stored on Blockchain. This will help is eliminating corruption
    & inefficiency linked leakages, thus unlocking huge government resources that
    may be otherwise wasted or are spent unproductively. Blockchain enables availability
    of high-quality data for AI and ML applications. Trust and transparency offered
    by Blockchain, as well as secured private digital identities (of devices and people)
    offers high quality record keeping, an integral component for several applications
    in Financial, Supply chain and in Health care applications like clinical record
    management, and electronic health records administration. In this book we have
    examined the process of implementing Blockchain application using Design thinking
    methodology and also got an idea about the Blockchain applications being implemented
    in several leading countries. Blockchain adoption is still in the nascent stage
    and there can be an exhaustive resource to learn about it in a comprehensive manner.
    It keeps evolving continuously and several new developments are underway. Hence,
    we need to have a mindset of continuous experimentation, openness to learn and
    a tolerance to ambiguity that allows us to adapt and stay in tune with the technological
    advancements. The core objective should be to leverage the best available technologies
    for the welfare of our citizens.ANNEXURE 1 Model Blockchain Country-Case Study
    Of Thailand No discussion on Blockchain across Governments is complete without
    closely examining the rapid strides Thailand is making to explore, extract and
    experience the Power of Blockchain in all its glory. I am extremely thankful to
    my close friend and ex-teammate, Sanat Bhat, a key member of IBM Thailand’s Blockchain
    Solutioning team, who has helped me in unravelling the immense potential of Blockchain
    through the actions being undertaken by Thailand’s Government and progressive
    Financial system. Thailand is indeed setting an example to the whole world about
    how to facilitate and manage the Blockchain Thailand government is seeking to
    unlock the nation’s economic potential, by leveraging the power of blockchain
    technology for the implementation of Thailand 4.0\. In keeping with Thailand 4.0’s
    emphasis on the use of digital technologies to spur national economic growth and
    development, blockchain has a critical role to play as catalysts for the promotion
    of digital innovation in Thailand. Leading by example, the Thai government is
    experimenting with using distributed ledgers in the operations of its various
    state agencies. In August 2017, Thailand Post, the country’s state enterprise
    for postal services, introduced the use of blockchain for its warehousing, sorting,
    shipping, and delivery processes with the aim of enhancing operational efficiency.
    Another notable government initiative had the Electronic Transactions Development
    Agency (ETDA) sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with local blockchain start-up
    Omise Co., Ltd. to build a national electronic Know-Your-Customer (e-KYC) platform,
    as part of the ETDA’s Digital ID project. Other than state agencies, blockchain
    use has also been taking place at the ministerial level. In October last year,
    the Ministry of Commerce announced that it is exploring the feasibility of using
    blockchain in the areas of copyright, agriculture, and trade finance to boost
    the country’s credibility in terms of intellectual property as well as the overall
    competitiveness of Thai businesses. Around the same time, the Ministry of Finance
    announced that it is planning to use blockchain to track tax payments for the
    purpose of detecting tax fraud. Fast forward to January 2020, the Ministry of
    Science and Technology’s National Electronics and Computer Technology Centre (NECTEC)
    announced that it has developed a blockchain-based voting system. It has been
    looking for trial partners to test out the system on a smaller scale, such as
    in elections for universities, provinces, local communities, etc. Aside from public
    administration, the Bank of Thailand (BoT), which is the country’s central bank,
    is also spearheading the use of blockchain for Thailand’s banking and finance
    industry. The BoT has been collaborating with eight local banks through an undertaking
    dubbed “Project Inthanon.” The project was launched in August 2018 with the objective
    of exploring the use of blockchain’s Proof of Concept (PoC) framework to develop
    a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for domestic wholesale fund transfers. Phase
    I of Project Inthanon, which was completed in January 2020, involved the development
    of a CBDC prototype using R3’s Corda blockchain platform. The results of the tests
    showed that the use of blockchain has the potential to enhance the efficiency
    of interbank payment transfers, particularly during off-hours. Phase II, which
    started in February this year and is expected to be completed by September, involves
    exploring the use of blockchain-based debt instruments issued by the BoT to reduce
    delivery and settlement times for interbank trading and repurchase transactions.
    Additionally, Phase II studies the use of blockchain for regulatory compliance
    and data reconciliation, particularly to facilitate the reconciliation by banks
    of its customer accounts with its money transfer records as part of its compliance
    obligations under BoT regulations. The final phase, i.e. Phase III, commenced
    in August this year and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. This
    phase entails a collaboration between the BoT and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
    (HKMA) to explore the use of blockchain for the development of interoperable ledgers
    for cross-border fund transfers. With 10% of Thais owning cryptocurrencies in
    one form or another, it is clear that the technology will have a role to play
    in shaping the Thai way of life. Given the advances made by the government and
    central bank in embracing the potential of blockchain, it may be just a matter
    of time before the Southeast Asian country escapes its various traps and propel
    its economy towards its Thailand 4.0 ambitions. 1\. Bodies to regulate Blockchain
    projects in Thailand Thailand has 3 Blockchain bodies that regulate the projects
    for Ministry of Finance.  Blockchain Community Initiative 3 years back several
    banks created the Thailand Blockchain Community Initiative(BCI). This week The
    Nation reported that 22 banks are now involved including foreign bank branches.
    BCI was responsible to approve all nation scale Blockchain projects for financial
    services in Thailand. The first application was for Letters of Guarantee (LG).
    The aim was to halve the costs involved in using the trade finance tool. Other
    benefits include reducing fraud and speeding up the process of issuing LGs. Every
    year in Thailand, there are more than 500,000 LGs issued worth more than Baht
    1.3 trillion ($43.2 billion). The aim is to digitize 50% of these within three
    years. The group is chaired by Predee Daochai who chairman of the Thai Bankers’
    Association is also. So far, testing was executed as part of the Bank of Thailand’s
    sandbox and is expected to go into production within the sandbox in June. To ensure
    a broad range of stakeholders, the project involves several state enterprises
    and large corporates including from the electricity, oil and chemical sectors.
    Accenture and IBM Thailand helped with the project, which is based on Hyperledger
    Fabric. The consortium has now incorporated with six shareholder banks, Bangkok
    Bank, Krungthai, Bank of Ayudhya, Kasikornbank, TMB and Siam Commercial. Several
    of these banks are involved in other blockchain initiatives. Bangkok Bank is part
    of both the Marco Polo and Voltrontrade finance consortia. State-owned Krungthaihas
    a cross border payments project. And Siam Commercialis working with Accenture
    on a procurement blockchain. Sixteen additional banks will use the platform. They
    are Kiatnakin Bank, Citibank, CIMB Thai, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Tisco,
    Thanachart, BNP Paribas, Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, Export-Import
    Bank of Thailand, Mizuho Bank, United Overseas Bank (Thai), Land and Houses Bank,
    Standard Chartered (Thai), Government Savings Bank, Industrial and Commercial
    Bank of China (Thai) and HSBC. The milestones of setting up the BCI were: ![](image-q6wdsoos.jpg) Figure

    (NITMX) was originally founded under the name ATM Pool Company Limited in 1993\.
    Subsequently, in July 2005, the company was renamed National ITMX Company Limited
    to expand and extend the scope of the company’s business and products. Specifically,
    NITMX was created to satisfy Thailand’s requirement to keep up with continuing
    global advancement in electronic commerce and payment systems. The shareholders
    of National ITMX are local commercial banks in Thailand. Under direction from
    the Bank of Thailand, National ITMX is set up to be the key infrastructure and
    central data processing system that exchanges, manages, and processes data across
    Member Banks /organizations in order to support various interbank services. NITMX
    is working with Thai Bankers Association (TBA) and member banks to establish “National
    Digital Trade Platform” (focusing on bank related business) to improve banks operations
    services and support new business. The Company offers the following products and

    NDTP for banking will be established to improve cross-border trade financing process
    and fraud prevention for banks. The conceptual flow explains a standard process
    and relevant actors of NDTP, more information following details.  Exporters /
    Importers submit financing requests and supporting documents to banks. Banks input
    the supporting document fields whether they have been financed before via platform’s
    API or web portal or Blockchain node. The platform validates each submitted document
    by querying and comparing against the registered documents. The platform will
    return duplicate status when an identical document is found (based on the defined
    business logic for document comparison for each document type). The platform will
    return the new document status when cannot find any similar document. Banks then
    make the decision for financing requests based on the provided information from
    the platform. Parts for the project: Transaction Flow for Document Registration,
    Validation & Cancellation are depicted as follows: ![](image-m559h750.jpg) Figure

    Implemented (A) Savings Bond Platform for the country As part of the mission to
    prepare its people for disruptive technologies, Bank of Thailand (BOT) has started
    to look at the benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain
    technology. BOT expects blockchain technology to enable all stakeholders to have
    access to the same information, increasing efficiency and transparency. BOT has
    selected the savings bond sales processes as its first use case. Bonds-related
    processes are complex, with many parties participating in the ecosystem, including
    selling agents, BOT and the Thailand Securities Depository, amongst others. It
    now takes 15 days for investors to receive their bonds after receiving allocation. Once
    completed, this initiative will help increase efficiency, whilst also reducing
    the total operating costs of the entire system, and it will be developed later
    on to form the basis for Thailand’s market infrastructure for government and corporate
    securities. This is one of the world’s first uses of blockchain technology in
    the field of government savings bond sales. BOT has collaborated with related
    organizations, including the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO), Thailand Securities
    Depository (TSD) and selling agents. This was accomplished by BOT and IBM contributing
    to the development of this system using blockchain, and facilitated through Design
    Thinking methodology, enabling teams to understand the challenges and requirements
    of all stakeholders. The DLT Scripless Bond project benefits all stakeholders.
    Investors will be able to receive their bonds faster – it takes 15 days now and
    will be only 2 days in the future. They will also be purchase bonds up to their
    full allocation rights from any bank. Selling agents, TSD and BOT will also be
    able to reduce processing time and workloads. Bond issuers will also be able to
    manage bond issues faster and stimulate increased competition between selling
    agents. Overall, the system will lead to reduced operating costs across the entire
    value chain with greater security. This important milestone leads to the digital
    economy and society. Based on these key benefits, blockchain technology can successfully
    move the settlement cycle of government savings bonds from trade date plus 15
    days (T+15) toward T+2 with improved management, security, and privacy. This is
    the first and important step in a journey of discovery. BOT analyzed many use
    cases and observed that the Thai government savings bond sales process had several
    points of friction that blockchain could potentially resolve. It is a time-consuming
    process that relies on a non-real-time system, has duplicate validation steps,
    with manual reconciliation requirements prone to data errors. Delivery of savings
    bonds to investors currently takes 15 days, whilst other government bonds issues
    can be delivered in just two days according to market best practice. Consequently,
    in early 2018, BOT initiated the DLT Scripless Bond Project and conducted a proof
    of concept around blockchain technology. The project was built with Hyperledger
    Fabric, an open source blockchain framework implementation, as the foundation
    of its prototype to assess potential benefits and business values which could
    potentially improve operational efficiency. The project was driven by BOT and
    supported by key industry participants employing their considerable expertise
    and experience. Key stakeholders and their roles/responsibilities in this project
    are:  Bank of Thailand (BOT): registrar and paying agent Thailand Securities Depository
    (TSD): Central Securities Depository (CSD) and ISIN/CFI code registration Public
    Debt Management Office (PDMO): bond issuer Bangkok Bank (BBL), Kasikorn Bank (KBank),
    Krungthai Bank (KTB) and Siam Commercial Bank (SCB): selling agents Thai Bond
    Market Association (ThaiBMA): bond symbol registration IBM: technology partner Leveraging
    the significant experience of IBM in enterprise blockchain solutions, this collaborative
    project employed IBM as a technical partner jointly managing the project and co-designing
    and developing solutions with BOT. A.1 Objectives  The DLT Scripless Bond Project
    aimed not only to enable BOT to gain deeper insights and develop capabilities
    and the implications of using blockchain technologies, as well as potential benefits
    in reducing overall costs to the industry, as well as maximizing operational process
    efficiencies. In order to identify both weaknesses and opportunities for blockchain
    technology, the project prototype was designed and developed with the following
    key features: Data integration and bookkeeping: to integrate all relevant data
    as the single source of truth and record all transaction activities Real-time
    information accessibility: to access information in near real-time to enable more
    rapid analysis and more effective management Smart contracts & automation: to
    facilitate more effective operations through smart contracts so as to maximise
    reduction of manual intervention. Reports and monitoring: to monitor information
    and enable visibility to authorized participants (on a ‘need-to-know’ basis). If
    there is sufficient technical and business value, replacement of the existing
    government savings bond sales operations with a blockchain solution might be considered
    and scaled out to other types of government bond services in the future. A.2 Approach Design
    Thinking was one of the methodologies used in the DLT Scripless Bond project to
    gain an empathic understanding of pains and problems in all aspects. All key stakeholders
    were engaged to provide their experiences and motivations. After brainstorming
    and discussion, the issues of redundant validation, data quality, data exchange,
    and reconciliation in the processing of government savings bond sales were uncovered.
    Major aspects were identified and targeted for improvement of operational processes
    and investor satisfaction: speed of sales transactions, data quality, and transparency
    of bond sales information. After collection of these requirements, a new set of
    processes (future state) was developed for government savings bond sales, forming
    the basis for the prototype development. Another methodology used was agile development.
    The prototype was developed in multiple scaled-down iterations with specific features
    which were evolved over time. The development team had to complete each iteration
    and made it ready for review periodically so that the prototype could be adapted,
    using feedback and updated requirements of key stakeholders. Developing the prototype
    with agile development allowed investigation of the solution, identified any potential
    weaknesses, and updated solution before the completed prototype was delivered. A.3
    Functional scope The proof of concept was focused on two key processes: bond registration
    and bond sales. Bond registration required digitization of paper documents including
    bond profiles and selling criteria according to prospectus applied to savings
    bonds. Once these data had been set up and finalized, they became the basis for
    a single source of truth for network participants to proceed to the next steps
    of the bond sales process. Bond sales had four sequential processes: bond sales
    and reservation, securities account opening, payments, and bond depository. During
    the sales process, shared information about specific bonds, such as issuance and
    remaining amount of sales could be accessed in real time. All sales transactions
    would be validated in smart contracts before being committed to the network. Bonds
    could be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis. The process of securities
    account opening was conducted automatically with smart contracts. Processing of
    payment and bond depository were handled externally by existing systems and Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) were developed to integrate them with the blockchain
    network. A management dashboard was provided to all stakeholders for access on
    a need-to-know basis to all relevant information and transactional status at every
    step of the bond registration and bond sales processes. A.4 Process design Handling
    multiple and concurrent reservation orders is a non-trivial requirement and presented
    opportunities for innovative approaches from a technology and business process
    engineering perspective. To ensure the reservation order system for government
    savings bonds is sufficiently robust, secure, and efficient for all, it was investigated
    to see whether or not adjustments to the remaining amount and allocations to individual
    investors was properly captured. Business requirements were formulated through
    Design Thinking exercises with key stakeholders. Ongoing engagement, including
    feedback and detailed discussion, developed a more comprehensive understanding
    of stakeholder issues, concerns, and expectations relating to the new processes
    and potential solution. Using this working model, all key stakeholders agreed
    to reduce the savings bond settlement cycle from trade date plus 15 days (T+15)
    to T+2, in line with international market best practice. After the Design Thinking
    workshop and subsequent participant feedback, the main features considered to
    be opportunities for improving process efficiency and transparency were as follows:  Single
    validation: This feature allowed participants to validate any transaction by using
    the same validation requirements set in the smart contracts before a transaction
    was committed to a ledger. No more additional application for validation was required. Single
    source of information: All participants would be able to access the same information,
    such as bond profiles, selling criteria, and remaining amount. The information
    was updated near real time and provided improved transparency for management. Common
    standard within the blockchain network: One set of standards was adopted for data
    format, reference data, and transactional data used in business processes to improve
    data quality and remove inefficiencies from digital business. Flexible information
    management: Before the process of bond depository, all sales transactions were
    editable to allow flexibility in timing of processing. Selling agents could update
    details as required. Any time a modification was made, the sales transaction would
    be digitally time-stamped and recorded for transaction transparency. Finally,
    T+2 processes and all operational improvements relating to bond registration and
    bond sales were designed according to the key elements and considerations illustrated
    below: a. Bond registration Prior to the sales of any government savings bond,
    the issuer is required to provide full disclosure of the bond profile and selling
    criteria that will be automatically created as smart contracts. Next, ThaiBMA
    will assign a unique bond symbol. After the bond symbol is assigned, the registrar
    requests the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and Classification
    of Financial Instruments (CFI codes) from a CSD. Finally, at the end of the bond
    registration process, the issuer will officially approve the publication of the
    relevant information for every stakeholder to use. b. Bond sales (T to T+2) Sales
    and reservations (T) During the sales period, all relevant information for sales,
    remaining amount, and purchasing quota for each individual investor is retrievable
    in real time. To reserve a bond allocation, selling agents are required to check
    whether there is sufficient quantity available for each purchase order, and that
    the order does not exceed the investor individual purchasing quota. Once a transaction
    is processed into the blockchain network, it will be validated against the selling
    criteria set in the smart contracts, to ensure that investors are eligible for
    allocation according to the prospectus. If all conditions and criteria are satisfied,
    the bonds will be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis and the remaining
    amount (starts with the issuance amount of bonds) will be immediately offset by
    the amount purchased. Once committed to the sales transaction ledger, transactions
    are visible to the registrar and CSD for any further action. Securities account
    opening (T to T+1) In the case of new investors, selling agents are required to
    provide specific details to open a securities account - this can be completed
    whilst making a bond reservation or on the next day (T+1) but must be done prior
    to the depository to enable flexibility for selling agents. Once the information
    has been confirmed by selling agents, CSD will be notified by smart contracts
    to open securities accounts in real time and in turn notify the status back to
    selling agents and registrar. Payments (T) At close of business, the total allocated
    amount of bonds and funds will be reconciled to the subscribed orders. All selling
    agents will then be notified and required to make payment to the registrar. The
    registrar will then transfer the funds received to the issuer. In this proof of
    concept, the funds transfer was performed externally. The payment status would
    then be returned to the blockchain network for next steps. Bond depository (T+1)
    and delivery (T+2) On T+1, CSD will be notified at a fixed time to credit bonds
    into investors’ securities accounts and then notify selling agents of the transaction
    status. As certain action is required away from the blockchain network after bonds
    are successfully credited into securities accounts, investors will be able to
    update their balances with their selling agents on the next business day (T+2). A.4
    Design considerations Within the focused areas of this project, bond registration
    and bond sales, the solution was designed to consider the value of blockchain
    capabilities in the following technical domains:  Accessing information on the
    blockchain network Prevention of duplicate reservations of bond sales and exceeding
    quota High throughput for bond sales and reservations Data privacy and cross-channel
    communication Message notification on blockchain A.5 Technical observations and
    key findings Accessing information on the blockchain network Hyperledger Fabric
    offers Software Development Kits (SDKs) in various programming languages such
    as Node.js or Java to interact with a blockchain network. Prevention of duplicate
    reservations of bond sales and exceeding quota: One of the most important factors
    in designing the blockchain prototype of government savings bond sales was to
    ensure data integrity and to prevent duplications, which could occur if an attempt
    were made to reserve the same asset in the ledger. The other consideration was
    to ensure that bonds sales and reservations did not exceed the available quota
    for bond sales. Concerning bond sales and reservations, each selling agent was
    required to verify that the remaining amount was sufficient to accept each individual
    for reservations across different sales channels. Once a selling agent submitted
    a sales transaction to the blockchain network, the remaining amount would be offset
    by the reserved amount and this deducted amount would be used as an initial number
    in calculation for the next transaction. Thus, the remaining amount must be accurate
    even when many concurrent transactions were submitted simultaneously by selling
    agents. In the assessment, a new bond issue was created with an issue size of
    100,000 baht. To simulate five selling agents making reservations, five concurrent
    transactions with reserved amounts of 1,000 baht each were submitted to the blockchain
    network within one second of each other. The transactions were allowed to complete
    and the subsequent test iterations were started after a one second pause. Ten
    iterations were done and assessed. The assessment revealed that 15 transactions
    were committed to the ledger and when checking the remaining amount, the new value
    of 85,000 baht was recorded. This meant that the solution prototype worked correctly
    by deducting the accurate number of 15,000 (15 x 1,000) baht from 100,000 baht. A
    read-write set is generated once an endorser executes the transaction. The read
    set contains a list of unique keys together with their committed versions of data
    whilst the write set contains a list of unique keys and their new values written
    in the transaction. Transactions are verified upon commit to ensure that the data
    that has been read is still valid and has not been modified by other transactions
    since. Due to the read-write set semantics, this assessment showed that transactions
    submitted at the same time all contain in their read sets the same unique key
    and a committed version of remaining amount asset. Once one of the concurrent
    transactions was committed to the ledger, the version of its unique key would
    be changed to a new one. For this reason, the other transactions with the read
    set containing the previous version of unique key would be marked as invalid,
    changes were not applied to the ledger and the client application would be alerted
    to retry the transactions if appropriate. High throughput transactions of bond
    sales and reservations During a high demand period, many sales transactions are
    likely to be submitted through all sales channels of selling agents at the same
    time. However, due to the limits placed on the amount of bonds issued, bonds will
    be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis until any new request exceeds
    the available balance. In the initial design, two assets were created:  “RemainingAmount”:
    for capturing the outstanding balance of bond issuance “TransactionDetail”: for
    recording details of each transaction such as investor name, reserved amount and
    bond series. Whenever a sales transaction was submitted by a selling agent, an
    asset of “TransactionDetail” would be created (add action). Next, the outstanding
    balance was checked to ensure that the sale was within limits of bond issued (read
    action). Then the value of “RemainingAmount” asset would be deducted (update action)
    by the reserved amount and committed the change to a blockchain network. During
    peak load, where multiple bond sales requests were submitted by multiple selling
    agents at the same time, it was observed that the initial design rejected a number
    of transactions submitted within a short time frame due to the concurrency control
    mechanism used in Hyperledger Fabric to prevent double-spending. The transactions
    which were submitted simultaneously would have had the same value of key and version
    of the “RemainingAmount” asset. If one of them was committed ahead of the others
    and the value of the version of the “RemainingAmount” asset was changed to the
    new version, the remaining transactions would be rejected as the transactions
    tried to update the outdated version. In order to find the most appropriate solution
    for solving this issue, three more alternatives were designed and assessed as
    follows: Alternative solution #1: checking outstanding balance This approach modified
    the way that checks were performed to prevent selling more than the available
    supply of bonds. Instead of maintaining a running count of the exact balance of
    unallocated bonds, the total reserved amount was recalculated based on all committed
    transactions whenever a new transaction was submitted. The reserved balance was
    then reconciled against the initial issue amount to confirm that there were unsold
    bonds. This approach worked for a single transaction, but just like the initial
    design, it was unable to handle multiple transactions submitted concurrently. For
    example, assume a scenario where the total issue size was 20,000,000 baht. Five
    prior sale transactions with reserved amounts of 1,000,000 baht each have been
    committed. Subsequently, three new bond reservation transactions of 1,000,000
    baht each were submitted concurrently. For each of the new transactions, the aggregated
    value of committed transactions (5,000,000 baht) was compared against the bond
    issue size of 20,000,000 baht to ensure that there were enough unsold bonds. The
    result of the outstanding balance calculation was the same for all the three new
    transactions prior to the commitment of any of them. However, once any one of
    these new transactions was successfully committed, the allocated amount would
    be updated and the two remaining transactions must be rejected as the version
    number they wish to update was no longer the most current. Alternative solution
    #2: par value allocation This approach stored the number of outstanding bonds
    instead of the outstanding issue size. For example, for an issue size of 10,000,000
    baht, the number of bonds to be sold was 10,000 at a par value of 1,000 baht each. Therefore,
    a sale transaction for 50,000 baht would allocate 50 units of the 10,000 bonds
    outstanding. These 50 units would be individually marked out for the buyer using
    a random selection process to minimize the probability of a conflict in the allocation
    process if concurrency was to be supported. Those marked units would not be available
    for any further transactions. Several issues were discovered with this approach.
    First, it took longer to complete a transaction than the other designs. Second,
    due to the random selection process, there remained a non-zero probability that
    the same units were marked for different sale transactions submitted concurrently.
    This would still cause a failure when committing transactions just as in the earlier
    solution prototypes. Alternative solution #3: delta commits To avoid the problem
    when transactions were submitted concurrently, the booking and confirmation steps
    was performed into two discrete steps. The solution was designed to use the delta
    commits approach by committing each transaction without pre-checking the balance
    retained in the “RemainingAmount” asset. Incoming transactions were created and
    queued up with a request status for reservations. Every five seconds, there was
    an off-chain application running outside the blockchain network to call the specific
    function used for collecting transactions which were committed during that time.
    The total amount of bonds required for reservations was then calculated from the
    committed transactions and checked to see if the remaining amount was sufficient
    for those reservations to be confirmed. If bonds were still available, each committed
    transaction would be approved and the remaining amount would be deducted by the
    reserved amount of the transaction sequentially. Although this solution prototype
    could handle the conflict found in the other designs, new issues were identified
    and needed to be considered. The remaining amount was not updated in real time
    because the precise figure would be confirmed after a transaction was committed,
    so there was a time lag between submission of a transaction and committing it
    to the blockchain network. In this case, the selling agent would have to wait
    for five seconds to ensure the reservation for the corresponding investor’s order
    was confirmed and the respective transaction was successfully approved. Such a
    time lag could be minimized by increasing the frequency of off-chain balance aggregation
    calling from the off-chain application. After testing with real-life workloads,
    the system would have had to go through process iterations and performance fine-tuning
    to ensure that the solution capabilities were aligned with the business requirements
    and expectations. Data privacy and cross-channel communication Security and privacy
    of data are of critical importance to preserve the sensitive information of all
    participants in the blockchain network. There are several methods which can be
    implemented in Hyperledger Fabric to ensure the data is safe, secure and available
    to everyone on need-to-know basis. In the solution prototype, two mechanisms were
    used during the assessment. Access Control Language (ACL) Access Control Language
    (ACL), an authorization that provides declarative access control in Hyperledger
    Composer, is implemented to distinguish different forms of access by participants
    or organizations in the blockchain network by specifying resources to which they
    are granted access. In this assessment, data visibility for all users was restricted
    with extra access control logic, implemented in smart contract’s Access Control
    Lists. Users from selling agent organizations were able to see only the information
    related to them, whilst users from the registrar and CSD could view all the data
    in the ledger. The solution prototype with ACL demonstrated that it was able to
    control the rights of each user according to the operations that were defined
    in the ACL file. Channel A private channel is a separate communication channel
    for sharing data with specific participants. Selling agents, for example, do not
    want to share their own details of sales transactions with other selling agents.
    Based on this requirement, a private channel was implemented to allow private
    data to be used and shared only with specifically defined participants. The remaining
    amount was shared between the selling agents so that they could access to an identical
    source for making bond reservations on a first-come, first-served basis. To enable
    this, the public channel, which recorded the remaining amount, was also implemented
    in the blockchain network for every selling agent to access. Figure 4.6 illustrates
    the concept as designed. Thus, the number of communication channels required depended
    on the number of selling agents in the network. The total number of communication
    channels could be calculated from the number of selling agent organizations (n)
    that had a node plus one => (n) + 1 channels. The result showed that participants
    could retrieve information in those specific channels for which they were authorized.
    According to the diagram, the registrar and CSD were registered for Chaincode
    1, which was the public channel to provide the remaining amount for checking whether
    sufficient bonds were available for reservation. Chaincode 2, however, was used
    only by selling agent A, registrar and CSD, because it was a private channel.
    The same pattern also applied to Chaincode 3, where data were privately shared
    only between selling agent B, registrar and CSD. In conclusion, the cross-channel
    communication and private channel using a blockchain ledger with a subset of network
    for each selling agent functioned properly. The information was retrievable on
    a need-to-know basis and shared only between authorized participants in the segregated
    network. This fact proved that Hyperledger Fabric provides the capabilities of
    information sharing with data privacy requirements. Besides the use of channels,
    Hyperledger Fabric also provided other confidentiality mechanisms which were not
    explored in this project. For example, the use of a private data collection feature
    offers more granular level transaction privacy than channels. This feature allows
    sensitive data to be stored only in a database that is local to the designated
    party and distributed only between other parties that are relevant to the transaction.
    References to the private transactions (but not the actual data itself) are updated
    to the public ledger between peers in the network and serve as verifiable proof
    of updates. Future work will consider taking advantage of these features to further
    optimize the solution as appropriate. Message notification on blockchain To facilitate
    the ease of doing business, message notification was implemented to notify relevant
    participants when a certain task was complete or required action. The event mechanism
    of Hyperledger Composer was used to achieve this requirement. Events were emitted
    by the Hyperledger Fabric Peer and delivered by Composer REST server to the web-based
    application over WebSockets. The assessment found that the publish-subscribe model
    provided a reliable channel for message transfer. Furthermore, the history of
    message notifications was stored in an off-chain database to allow participants
    to retrieve information when needed later. Deployment options Data security is
    one of the most critical issues in financial services. In many cases, there are
    strict regulatory compliance requirements to ensure that arrangement for solutions
    and data are established on-premise instead of via cloud. The solution prototype
    was also deployed on-premise, in addition to cloud, to ensure that it performed
    smoothly and could satisfy the assessment. Running in an on-premise environment,
    the prototype was modified by making minor changes in the same scripts used on
    cloud to align it with the configuration in the data centre. In the current setup,
    Hyperledger Fabric required two communication ports to be opened per peer, which
    were accommodated by firewall rules. Although performance fine-tuning was still
    required, the solution prototype was successfully migrated from cloud to the on-premise
    environment and functioned as expected. High availability In this assessment,
    the impacts of shutting down certain components of Hyperledger Fabric, including
    endorsing and ordering peers and Hyperledger Fabric CA were investigated. Endorsing
    peers The environment for the assessment was set up as shown in figure 4.7\. The
    registrar and CSD were endorsers and each of them consisted of two peers in “Channel
    A”. In Hyperledger Fabric, an endorsement policy describes the conditions by which
    a transaction can be endorsed. A transaction can only be considered valid if it
    has been endorsed according to its policy. In this example, we defined an endorsement
    policy whereby a minimum of three out of four peers would be the number of endorsing
    peers. To assess the lack of availability, each endorsing peer was shut down to
    investigate its consequence in the following scenarios. The assessment successfully
    demonstrated the availability of endorsing peers according to the endorsement
    policy. Certificate Authority The environment for assessing the availability of
    Hyperledger Fabric CA was identical to that for endorsing peers shown in figure
    4.7\. The registrar and CSD both had one Hyperledger Fabric CA and two peers.
    The assessment found that if one of two Hyperledger Fabric CA was available, certificate
    issuance could be performed. In addition, a transaction could proceed, even though
    both CAs were not available after a certificate had been issued. The result of
    scenarios is shown in the table below: In summary, Hyperledger Fabric proved its
    capabilities to function properly when a subset of endorsing peers were available
    to endorse a transaction according to the endorsement policy. Transactions could
    be performed continuously, even if some of Hyperledger Fabric CAs, Kafkas, Zookeepers,
    and ordering peers were not available. Moreover, the data of failed peers could
    be synchronized in the channel once they were fully recovered. Besides SOLO and
    Kafka which is available out of the box, the ordering service is designed to be
    pluggable to support other implementation forms. Performance Government savings
    bonds can be sold via selling agents’ branches, ATMs, mobile banking, and internet
    banking. Currently, four selling agents operate over 4,000 branches across Thailand.
    In the worst-case scenario, an excessive number of transactions could be submitted
    through those sales channels at the same time and intensively during a period
    of high demand. Any solution, therefore, must be designed to be able to handle
    extreme conditions without compromising performance. While the focus of the proof
    of concept was to address the functional requirements, several performance tests
    was executed against the requirements of the project. The tests were conducted
    over both a cloud and on-premise environment. One of the experiments looked at
    the network topology. From the experiments, it was observed that the number of
    peers had a larger impact on performance, whilst other factors, such as the number
    of API instances and block-size configurations, did not significantly affect performance. For
    the performance test conducted on-premises, the focus was on the infrastructure
    configurations that could enhance performance, such as storage types, number of
    Central Processing Units (CPUs) and memory capacity. It was observed that the
    solution prototype developed using Go performed better by increasing the number
    of CPUs, as well as having greater memory size and changing the consensus algorithm
    to Kafka/Zookeeper. It was found that the performance was better than the SOLO
    consensus used for development and testing, as it could handle 1,000 concurrent
    transactions without rejecting any transactions. As the performance results described
    here are specific to the nature of the project and setup, it does not aim to represent
    the performance potential of the underlying technology nor does it attempt to
    be exhaustive in its scope. Nevertheless, the exercise served as a useful reference
    on the performance characteristic of the solution and enables a better understanding
    of contributing factors that could have an impact on performance. Summary of the
    Scripless Bond Project: The DLT Scripless Bond project has proven that blockchain
    technology can drive the business transformation of government savings bonds.
    Its benefits and business values are shared across stakeholders, providing improved
    transparency, higher efficiencies and more effective management of information. Blockchain
    technology also brings a shifting paradigm of ecosystem services and management.
    Preparations for establishing the appropriate governance, business and operating
    models for all stakeholders will be initiated to encourage the expansion of business
    networks and incorporate the emergence of new technologies and opportunities arising
    from them. To bring about lasting value, the effective collaboration of related
    stakeholders is key. The contribution of all participants is highly valued and
    provides the industry with greater understanding of business processes in developing
    prototypes. BOT and market participants together recognize there is much work
    ahead, in order to overcome the challenges of implementing a blockchain solution
    in the real world. This proof of concept is just the first step that paves the
    way for the journey in developing Thailand’s market infrastructure for government
    and corporate securities markets in the near future. (B) National Digital ID Government
    identification systems are an important issue in the digital world. The government
    has adopted technology to serve the policy of Thailand 4.0\. The national identity
    still segmented and distributed between government agencies, not holistically,
    which bring inconvenience to the users because each service must be registered
    and the users have to remember the username and password for every service. Thus,
    results in bad practice of security when users use the same password. Blockchain
    digital identity is now especially outstanding. The technologies still lacks the
    development of personal identification however access to traditional services
    like as a legal & political right, finance services, education, health services,
    social benefit or participant in the digital world like a web services, professional
    network, e-commerce, marketplace, social communities both need the identification
    function when they need to access services. National Digital ID Blockchain Consortium
    was set up which is a secure and simple service that has the functionality of
    identification. The NIDBC framework consists of three part, which are smart contracts,
    libraries, and an application. The application keeps private keys. Smart contracts
    are the core of the identity services and incorporate logic. Libraries are integrated
    with third-party services. NIDBC identities have many variations for instance
    personality, devices, and entities. NIDBC identities are self-service, Implications
    for users for entirely operated and managed by themselves, and do not depend on
    centralized third parties for set permission or proof. A core function of NIDBC
    is that it can digitally sign and verify a claim, action, or transaction, which
    covers a wide range of application case studies. A digital ID stays cryptographically
    linked to off chain data. Every identity is able to store the hash of an attributed
    data, which secure the data corresponding with identity. The digital ID can update
    the file by themselves, for example, adding more information, and grant permission
    to read, write, and update specific files because the user can access the blockchain,
    NIDBC can control digital resources like cryptocurrencies or the other token. National
    Digital ID based on the BC. Framework is composed of five phases, including Identity
    and Services Provider Registration Phase, User Privacy Creation Phase, User Registration
    Phase, User Authentication Phase and More Information Request Phase as the following: ![](image-35phehb1.jpg) Figure
    A1.6: NIDBC: National ID on the Blockchain  Identity and Services Provider Registration
    Phase In this phase, Both SP and IP need register in the system. All parties provide,
    exchange information, i.e., Service Information, IP address, and Permission to
    request certificates from CA. SP requests for membership to acquire identity information
    for U access services. In the same way, IP updates available information to SP
    whenever SP leaves the system. IP collects all the list of updated content to
    create catalogue identity information. SP registers with IP by creating a message
    that includes their information along with signing their private keys and public
    keys. Then they send the message to IP, when IP receives the message, IP uses
    attached public key to decrypt the message, then IP validates SP and creates a
    new message stating whether it accepts or rejects. Then it sends it back through
    an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) communications channel to SP. After that, SP receives
    the message; SP uses their private keys to decrypt the message. SP sends their
    identity information message to IP along with the encrypted public key of SP and
    hashes content along with the signed private key of SP for message integrity and
    mutual trust sender. Whenever IP receives the message, IP will decrypt the message
    by using its private key to get the identity information and validates the sender
    by checking the owner of the private key and validates the hash value for message
    integrity. User Privacy Creation Phase In this phase, U creates an asymmetric
    key of the private and the public key. U creates VIDu instead of using public
    identity to protect their privacy. Next, U keeps private key safely. Finally,
    U creates VIDu by utilizing the hash of public key so that the mechanism for generating
    the VIDu can be similar to the Bitcoin address. User Registration Phase In this
    phase, U registers to the IP but is not registered with the SP. U needs to use
    a service offered by the SP, but U does not want the creation of a new ID and
    provides personal information to the SP for the service. U sends their information
    including the public key of U and VIDu to IP. After IP receives, IP creates their
    own digital signature. IP sends public key of U and VIDu that has been signed
    with SP’s private key to BC. Then IP sends SP’s public key to U. User Authentication
    Phase In this phase, SP reads the user’s VIDu and user’s public key information
    from the BC, when the user requests to access the service to the VIDu. SP can
    confirm whether the claimed VIDu from the user is the one registered with the
    BC by accessing the BC. If the confirmation is correct, the partner begins the
    mutual authentication procedure for the user with the user’s VIDu and user’s public
    key obtained from the BC. More Information Request Phase SP wants more information
    of U, SP requests to IP for providing its service to U. For instance, if SP is
    National Health Security Office (NHSO), thus it requires at least the U medical
    treatment records to deliver claim. SP requests information from U. (C) Digital
    CBDC The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has announced the project to develop the prototype
    of the payment system for businesses using Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC),
    which will build upon knowledge from Project Inthanon. The project scope will
    include conducting a feasibility study and developing a process to integrate CBDC
    with the business’ innovative platform. The BOT recognizes and supports the important
    roles of financial innovation and technology in enhancing the competitiveness
    and readiness of the business sector entering the digital age. The project marks
    an important step in broadening CBDC’s scope and adoption to wider audiences,
    starting with large corporates. In this project, the CBDC prototype will be integrated
    with the procurement and financial management systems of the Siam Cement Public
    Company Limited and its suppliers developed by Digital Ventures Company Limited.
    The prototype is expected to serve as a financial innovation that enables higher
    payment efficiency for businesses such as increasing flexibility for fund transfers
    or delivering faster and more agile payments between suppliers. The project will
    begin in July 2020 and is expected to conclude by the end of the year, after which
    the BOT will publish the project summary and outcome accordingly. In addition,
    Project Inthanon, the collaborative project between the BOT and the eight leading
    financial institutions to study and develop the proof-of-concept for domestic
    wholesale funds transfer using wholesale CBDC, has been accomplished in January
    2020 with the successful completion of the cross-border transfer prototype co-developed
    with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). In the next step, the BOT, the HKMA
    and the participating financial institutions will continue to collaborate and
    experiment CBDC for other use cases in cross- The BOT strongly believes that continuous
    collaborations and development in financial innovation with the business sector
    would lay foundation in building technological capacity and readiness for the
    financial services and businesses rapidly entering the digital age. Moreover,
    the BOT remains open to private sector engagements to further promote innovation
    and explore potential uses cases for future adoptions. Project Inthanon is a collaborative
    effort with the goal to develop and test a proof-of-concept (POC) for domestic
    wholesale fund transfer using wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wholesale
    CBDC). The project explores the potential in using Distributed Ledger Technology
    (DLT) to enhance Thailand’s financial infrastructure and to encourage collaborative
    learning among involved parties. Project Inthanon Phase I (August 2018 – January
    2019) was conducted by the BOT, a technology partner R3, and eight participating
    banks including Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited, Krung Thai Bank Public Company
    Limited, Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited, Kasikornbank Public Company Limited,
    Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited, Thanachart Bank Public Company Limited,
    Standard Chartered Bank (Thai) Public Company Limited, and The Hongkong and Shanghai
    Banking Corporation Limited. The outcome and findings of Project Inthanon Phase
    I The results of Project Inthanon Phase I indicated that DLT can fulfil basic
    payment functionalities. In addition, the technology demonstrated capabilities
    to help enhance payment efficiency and to support interbank transfer and settlement
    during off-hours. It is worth noting that despite its high capabilities, DLT would
    need more time to mature to the stage in which the technology can be fully adopted
    for the payment system infrastructure. More experiments would be needed to further
    affirm DLT’s capabilities, and any challenges to comply with international payments
    standard such as scalability, security and system resiliency should be explored. The
    learning outcome and test results from Phase I provide an important basis for
    the development of Thailand’s payment system. (Further details on the Phase I
    results are available for download at the following URL: https://www.bot.or.th/English/FinancialMarkets/ProjectInthanon/Documents/Inthanon_Phase1_Report.pdf The
    Scope of Project Inthanon Phase II Based on the developed POC, the BOT, R3 and
    the eight participating banks will continue to collaboratively explore further
    applications of DLT in two areas: (1) Interbank Trading and Repurchase transaction
    to reduce delivery and settlement time for financial transactions related to BOT
    issued debt instruments on DLT system, and (2) Regulatory Compliance and Data
    Reconciliation to explore how DLT can facilitate banks’ reconciliation of customer
    accounts and money transfers in compliance with the BOT regulations in order to
    reduce error and associated compliance costs. Project Inthanon Phase II will start
    in February 2019 and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2019
    after which the BOT will publish a project report accordingly. SCG has announced
    that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Bank of Thailand
    and Digital Ventures to develop a prototype system of Central Bank Digital Currency
    (CBDC) to enhance the efficiency of purchasing and payment management in the business
    sector. The CBDC is being developed to reduce transaction steps and processing
    time, which will be conducive to boosting business confidence and competitiveness
    and promoting Fintech innovation in the future. 3\. Next Nation scale Blockchain
