- en: In June of 2018, I became the Director of the Blockchain Center of Excellence
    (BCoE) at the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas.
    It was an opportunity of a lifetime to work with fellow blockchain enthusiasts
    including Professor Matt Waller, the Dean of the Walton College; Professor Rajiv
    Sabherwal, Chair of the Information Systems (ISYS) Department; Professor Paul
    Cronan, Director of Management Information Systems (MIS) graduate programs; and
    Dr. Zach Steelman, Assistant Professor of IS (and resident blockchain guru). They
    laid the groundwork for the BCoE.

    Kathryn Carlisle, BCoE Senior Managing Director; Professor Dan Conway, BCoE Associate
    Director; Professor Remko Van Hoek, BCoE Advisor; and Andrea Morgan, ISYS Department
    Assistant. A special thanks to Jacob Yates, our rock-star graduate MIS student,
    for updating statistics and uses cases. Jacob, you have all the makings of a University
    Professor, and I look forward to future collaborations as you pursue a Ph.D. with
    us.'

    of Missouri-St. Louis for over a quarter century. Dr. Dinesh Mirchandani, Chair
    of the Information Systems Department, and Charles Hoffman, Dean of the College
    of Business, supported every request to enable our blockchain research. Other
    colleagues engaged in thoughtful conversations about the research, most notably,
    Dr. Nasser Arshadi, Professor of Finance; Dr. Tom Eyssell, the Associate Dean
    and Director of Graduate Studies at the time; Dr. Shaji Khan, Associate Professor
    of Information Systems; and Dr. Steve Moehrle, Chair of the Accounting Department.
    Dr. Joseph Rottman, Associate Dean, has been my longtime collaborator, confidant,
    and friend.
