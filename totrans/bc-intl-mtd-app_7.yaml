    blockchain systems, there are open research directions in this emerging area.
    In this chapter, we discuss the open issues of blockchain intelligence from aspects
    such as federated learning on blockchain, collective intelligence bestowing blockchain,
    and artificial intelligence to enhance blockchain automation.

    blockchain has the potential to reshape incumbent industrial and business systems.
    Meanwhile, blockchain-enabled smart contracts can automate business procedures
    without the introduction of the third parties, thereby mitigating the administrative
    cost and reducing the turnaround time. Moreover, blockchain systems and smart
    contracts have generated massive volumes of blockchain data, which contains huge
    business values. The integration of AI, machine learning, deep learning, and big
    data technologies can process, explore, and extract valuable information from
    heterogeneous blockchain data. The intelligent capability brought to blockchain
    is named as *blockchain intelligence*, which can greatly drive the development
    of the blockchain ecosystem. In the earlier chapters of this book, the wide applications
    of blockchain intelligence have been elaborated.

    ecosystem, there are still some open research problems. We next discuss the open
    issues and outline the future directions in blockchain intelligence. We start
    from federated learning on blockchain in Sect. [7.2](#Sec2), then discuss the
    issues on collective intelligence in Sect. [7.3](#Sec3), and next elaborate the
    research directions on automated machine learning for blockchain in Sect. [7.4](#Sec6).

- en: 'The incumbent enterprise information system across multiple business sectors
    within an enterprise or across multiple enterprises has the following characteristics:
    (1) complexity of different systems, (2) heterogeneity of data types across different
    systems, and (3) the absence of interoperability among different systems. These
    characteristics pose the challenges in information sharing among different systems.
    Moreover, the privacy and security concerns also discourage the inclinations of
    data sharing across different information systems.'

- en: Blockchain can improve the interoperability and enhance the information sharing
    across different systems (Dai et al. [2019](#CR3)). On the one hand, the peer-to-peer
    (P2P) network of blockchain can offer a decentralized middleware connecting different
    systems together. The decentralized architecture can enhance the system reliability
    and reduce the faulty risks due to the single-point failure or malicious attacks
    such as distributed denial-of-service attack (Xie et al. [2020](#CR14)). Moreover,
    the built-in cryptographic and digital signature schemes can also provide the
    basic security protection on enterprise and industrial data.

    different systems, blockchain-based information sharing systems cannot fully protect
    the data privacy. In particular, user identifications or pseudonyms can be broken
    through association analysis and inference of transaction and account data of
    blockchain (Conti et al. [2018](#CR1)). Although the methods such as mixed coins,
    differentiated privacy, and homomorphic obfuscations can somehow enhance the data
    privacy protection, they cannot fundamentally solve the problem.

- en: The advent of federated learning Yang et al. ([2019](#CR15)) attempts to solve
    the information sharing problem from a different perspective. The main purpose
    of information sharing is the knowledge extraction and sharing across different
    intelligent agents, consequently reaching the wisdom level (Frické [2018](#CR5)),
    as shown in Fig. [7.1](#Fig1). Therefore, federated learning essentially shares
    the knowledge learned from distributed learning models instead of sharing data.
    In this way, the data privacy can be well preserved.![../images/506524_1_En_7_Chapter/506524_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/506524_1_En_7_Chapter/506524_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: Therefore, it becomes an inevitable trend to integrate blockchain and federated
    learning together. The consolidation of blockchain and federated learning can
    leverage the benefits of blockchain like decentralization and security assurance
    as well as the merits of federated learning such as privacy preservation, consequently
    solving the privacy and security concerns on information sharing. There are several
    attempts toward the integration of blockchain and federated learning (Kim et al.
    [2020](#CR10); Lu et al. [2020](#CR11); Qu et al. [2020](#CR12)). In these studies,
    local machine learning models are trained from local data, which is not required
    to be transferred to remote cloud servers, thereby preserving the data privacy.
    Then, the trained models (i.e., the hyper parameters) can be shared with each
    other so as to improve the learning effect. In this design, blockchain can solve
    the problem in a decentralized manner, thereby reducing the single-point failure
    risk.

- en: There are a number of issues to be addressed in the future studies. First, incentive
    mechanisms need to be properly designed to motivate distributed nodes to contribute
    their models to the consolidated models, thereby improving the overall model (or
    the learned knowledge). Second, most existing studies on the integration of blockchain
    and federated learning only consider the off-chain data while few of them investigate
    the on-chain blockchain data. It is a direction to conduct federated learning
    on distributed on-chain blockchain data. Moreover, it is shown in Jagielski et
    al. ([2018](#CR9)) that the training models can be manipulated via tampering the
    training data so as to make the training model deviate from the normal prediction.
    Thus, this model poisoning problem is expected to be solved especially in a federated
    learning environment.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Collective intelligence* is essentially the group intelligence obtained through
    collaboration, collection, and even competition (He et al. [2019](#CR7)). Multiple
    intelligent agents in distributed systems can collaborate and coordinate together
    to evolve from singular intelligence of individual agents to group intelligence
    of multiple agents. Blockchain systems, characterized by decentralization and
    distribution, can be well integrated with *collect intelligence* to construct
    the decentralized blockchain intelligence. We next outline the future directions
    on two aspects: (1) collective intelligence bestowing blockchain systems and (2)
    collective intelligence bestowing smart contracts, as shown in Fig. [7.2](#Fig2).![../images/506524_1_En_7_Chapter/506524_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/506524_1_En_7_Chapter/506524_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png)'

- en: The decentralization of blockchain systems has bred multiple intelligent agents,
    which can evolve individually through learning from their own ambient data. It
    is challenging to let them collaborate with each other in the decentralized environment.
    It is true that the incentive mechanisms in blockchain can motivate these multiple
    intelligent agents to contribute their collected data (Huang et al. [2020](#CR8)).
    However, as shown in Sect. [7.2](#Sec2), data sharing may also expose users’ privacy.
    Therefore, it is a better way to share the knowledge (instead of data sharing)
    through the collaboration of multiple intelligent agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, the integration of collective intelligence with blockchain systems
    will be a future direction though there are quite few studies on this promising
    topic. Similar to the consolidation of blockchain and federated learning as in
    Sect. [7.2](#Sec2), each individual can learn from its own ambience (or the local
    data) and the learned knowledge can then be synthesized together. Different from
    federated learning, which only concerns the collaboration, collective intelligence
    also considers the competition of intelligent agents since the competition among
    intelligent agents can also evolve the intelligence of agents (Guo et al. [2020](#CR6)).
    In this regard, new incentive mechanisms should be devised to motivate the competition
    among multiple intelligent agents.

- en: The current QoS assurance approaches of smart contracts are mainly based on
    the analysis of contract patterns (e.g., detecting and classifying vulnerable
    contracts) at a sole peer in the blockchain. In contrast to a single intelligent
    agent, *collective intelligence* can motivate all participants to engage in analyzing
    and reasoning, thereby contributing their collective knowledge to make better
    decisions in a global context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, collective intelligence can bestow intelligence on smart contracts. It
    will be worthwhile integrating collective intelligence with smart contracts. However,
    to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies on the integration of collective
    intelligence with smart contracts. In the future, collective intelligence is expected
    to integrate with decentralized blockchain systems so as to offer a trustworthy
    and intelligent provision of smart contract services atop the underlining blockchain
    systems.

    the benign development of the blockchain ecosystem. For example, blockchain intelligence
    can achieve the intelligent monitoring of blockchain and quality assurance of
    smart contracts. During this process, AI, especially machine learning and deep
    learning algorithms, plays an important role in analyzing blockchain and smart
    contract data and extracting valuable information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, incumbent blockchain systems need to be evolved from the current *AI-aided*
    blockchain intelligence to the future *AI-driven* blockchain intelligence. In
    particular, most of the current studies on blockchain intelligence mainly concentrate
    on data analytics on blockchain and smart contract data. There is still a long
    way to go before the real intelligence is achieved, where the real intelligence
    is characterized by the capacity of learning, reasoning, planning, and problem
    solving in an autonomous manner. Therefore, the future studies on blockchain intelligence
    need to embrace the advent of AI technologies, such as reinforcement learning,
    reasoning, recommendation, and decision making as shown in Fig. [7.3](#Fig3).
    We next outline several possible future directions in this perspective.![../images/506524_1_En_7_Chapter/506524_1_En_7_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/506524_1_En_7_Chapter/506524_1_En_7_Fig3_HTML.png)

- en: Existing studies on blockchain performance are mainly involved with blockchain
    system monitoring. Most of these studies mainly concentrate on data analytics
    of blockchain performance data (like system logs and other records) (Zheng et
    al. [2018](#CR16)). The performance data of blockchain systems includes many different
    metrics, such as P2P network status, remote procedure call (RPC) response rate,
    and transaction propagation rate. Through analyzing the performance data, performance
    bottlenecks and possible failures can be identified.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, current studies on performance monitoring and analysis of blockchain
    systems still require substantial human interventions via provision of numerical
    values in different metrics, which are only understandable to the experienced
    system administrators. The future operational management of blockchain systems
    is expected to be more autonomous and intelligent. For example, blockchain systems
    can automatically restore from crashes and adjust system configurations to balance
    the burdens at different subsystems.

    exhibiting in the lower transaction throughput, compared with other transactional
    systems like VISA and PayPal. The improvements on the scalability of blockchain
    can be done through (1) exploiting more scalable consensus algorithms (like sharding-based
    consensus (Dang et al. [2019](#CR4))), (2) directed acyclic graph (DAG) for consensus
    (Cui et al. [2020](#CR2)), (3) off-chain strategies (Xie et al. [2019](#CR13)),
    and (4) adopting more scalable blockchain systems like private or consortium blockchains
    for some specific application scenarios.

    direction. In particular, AI algorithms can be integrated with the scalable schemes,
    such as sharing mechanisms DAG and off-chain schemes to achieve the scalability
    of blockchain. For example, machine learning approaches can be adopted to determine
    the size of each shard so as to achieve the expected performance. Moreover, machine
    learning methods can also be used to determine the proportion of off-chain blockchain
    data and on-chain blockchain data in the off-chain strategies.
