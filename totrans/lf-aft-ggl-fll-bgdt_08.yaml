    Introduced by the Russian mathematician and information theorist Andrey Markov
    in 1913, it became a set of statistical tools for predicting the future from the
    present. Powerfully extended in what are called “hidden Markov models,” the technique
    can uncover unobserved realities behind a series of observations, such as images
    of cats and dogs at Google, patterns of weather over time, or even human minds.[¹](notes.html#ch08note-1)

- en: A black-bearded atheist, chess master, and political activist, Markov was dubbed
    “Andrey the Furious.” A cantankerous genius, he was aligned with the left in the
    closing years of the Tsarist regime, not anticipating the totalitarian turn it
    would take after the triumph of the Bolsheviks. Though he achieved in his lifetime
    a certain eminence as a mathematician, his real influence would not be felt for
    nearly a century, when his work proved essential to the foundation of the Google-era
    system of the world.

    time. Until Markov, the theory of probability, like the theory of physics, mostly
    avoided temporal considerations. As Amy Langville and Philipp von Hilgers write
    in a canonical essay, the dominant probability concepts failed to differentiate
    between serial and parallel processes, between “a thousand throws of a single
    die and a thousand dice each thrown once.”[²](notes.html#ch08note-2) Addressing
    the temporal dependencies between events, how one thing leads to another, Markov
    chains trace the probabilistic transitions from one state or condition to another,
    step by step through time.

    Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, who had pioneered this statistical mode of
    thought in physics. They invented probabilistic tools to describe physical phenomena,
    such as the hidden behavior of atoms and molecules, waves and particles, which
    could not be seen or measured by the scientific instruments of their day. Their
    statistical laws of thermodynamics provided theoretical physics a much-needed
    arrow of time derived from the concept of entropy.

    years before they were publically formulated by Markov, was Albert Einstein. In
    1905, calculating the hidden behavior of molecules in Brownian motion, he showed
    that they occupied a chain of states that jiggled at a rate of around two gigahertz
    following a “random walk,” as in Markov’s concept. Showing the movements of atoms
    without seeing or measuring them, Einstein translated from what is now termed
    a Markov sequence of observable states of a gas to his proof of the then-still-hidden
    Brownian motion of the molecules.

    theory. By the time of his death in 1922, he had turned his precursors’ improvisations

    information theory, are behind the dominant advances of the Google era, from big
    data and cloud computing to speech recognition and machine learning.

    showed that linguistic properties could be grasped mathematically and predicted
    without knowing the particular language. In focusing on patterns of vowels and

    computing complex chains, overcoming the computing costs that grew exponentially

    Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) demonstrated how a sufficiently long chain
    of observations can be iterated until the probability of an underlying explanation
    is maximized. These maximized probabilities define the original structure of the
    source and allow subsequent predictions, whether of words or financial prices.
    Facilitating Baum’s work was the prestigious but little-known Markov contributor
    Lee Neuwirth, the longtime head of IDA, who named the predictive use of the chains
    “hidden Markov models” at a 1980 conference in Princeton.

    Turing machine steps, chess positions, gambling prospects, computer performance,
    commodity markets, traffic reports—you name it—linked to other states by “transition
    probabilities.” I drew three kings; what is the likelihood of a fourth? It snowed
    today; what is the probability that it will rain tomorrow? The opening price of
    an Amazon share is $1,421 at nine A.M.; what will be the price at 9:01? The transition
    probabilities may be calculated from previous data and updated with new observations.

    connections and weights corresponding to the hierarchical hidden Markov Model

    “there must be an essential mathematical equivalence to a high degree of precision

    currencies, their downside protected by government. Main Street and Silicon Valley
    want stable money for long-term investments, the upside guaranteed by the rule
    of law. The governments of the world, their money unmoored, favor finance over
    enterprise, shortening the time horizons of economic activity. Among fast traders
    the rhythms are reduced to seconds and the economy endures a hypertrophy of short-term
    finance.

    and “market neutral” financial strategies. Market-neutral trading is a Midas touch
    in the financial system. It consists mostly of zero-sum maneuvers and has little
    engagement with the saga of creative human progress. It improves the efficiency
    and liquidity of markets at the cost of creating Siren Servers that lure the unwary
    into sterile fields of algorithmic finance.

    which I believe is as impressive as the achievement of Google. But I concluded
    that this system of the world is obsolescent. It is based on big data that will
    face diminishing returns. It is founded on frequencies of trading that fail to
    correspond to any real economic activity. It feeds on mathematics of randomness
    that blur the differences between value creation and noise generation. Its source
    in memoryless Markov processes ultimately will bring the model back to the inevitable
    failures of gambler’s ruin.

    data points, reflecting long and purposeful preparation and invention in the real

    are high-entropy, unexpected. Parsing of random patterns for transitory correlations

    thinking systems, are actually random machines is not really very bright. Markov
    models work by obviating human intelligence and knowledge. Whether analyzing speech
    without knowing the language (Shannon and Baum), gauging the importance of webpages
    without knowledge of either the pages or the evaluators (Page and Brin), measuring
    the performance of computing machines while ignoring 99 percent of the details
    of the system (A. L. Scherr), investing in stocks and bonds with no awareness
    of the businesses that issue them (Renaissance), or identifying authors without
    any knowledge of what they wrote or even the language they write in (Markov himself),
    these procedures are marked and enabled by their total lack of intelligence. You
    use big data statistics and Markov probability models when you don’t know what
    is really happening. Markov models are idiot savants that can predict either a
    random pattern or a planned process without the slightest understanding of either.
    For its future, the industry must move beyond them.

    maturities do not match in almost any banking system because of the divergence
    between the motivations of savers and the sources of the value of savings. Savers
    attempt to preserve their wealth while having it still available in a liquid form,
    where they can retrieve it whenever they wish. But that very wealth of savings,
    for its perpetuation and expansion, is dependent on long-term investments in perilous
    processes of learning—real investments in companies and projects that can fail

    this relationship on its head. It now abides by the rule “Don’t invest in anything
    you know about.” With learning prohibited, the current algorithms make almost
    no investments and generate no enduring wealth. Instead, by accelerating trades
    in the oceans of currencies and short-term securities—the $280 trillion of global
