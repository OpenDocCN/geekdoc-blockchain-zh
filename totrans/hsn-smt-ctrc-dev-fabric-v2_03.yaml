- en: This part consists of two chapters. In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#overview_of_hyperledger_projects_and_to),
    we introduce you to the Hyperledger ecosystem by reviewing its projects, tools,
    and libraries, and then expand on the Hyperledger terms and concepts discussed
    in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#fundamental_concepts_of_blockchain) by explaining them
    in detail. In [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#hyperledger_fabric_architecture_and_com),
    we review the Hyperledger Fabric components—including peer, channel, and chaincodes—that
    are essential for building blockchain applications and understanding the rest
    of the chapters. In short, a thorough understanding of all Hyperledger Fabric
    components is highly recommended for building, deploying, and managing enterprise-level
    Hyperledger Fabric applications.
