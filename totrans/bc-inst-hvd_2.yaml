    of people. But the system is rife with problems, adding cost through fees and
    delays, creating friction through redundant and onerous paperwork, and opening
    up opportunities for fraud and crime. To wit, 45% of financial intermediaries,
    such as payment networks, stock exchanges, and money transfer services, suffer
    from economic crime every year; the number is 37% for the entire economy, and
    only 20% and 27% for the professional services and technology sectors, respectively.^([1](#chapter7-1))
    It’s no small wonder that regulatory costs continue to climb and remain a top
    concern for bankers. This all adds cost, with consumers ultimately bearing the
    burden.

    it resistant to change and vulnerable to systems failures and attacks. Third,
    it’s exclusionary, denying billions of people access to basic financial tools.

    like bitcoin. A vast, globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices,
    it is capable of recording anything of value. Money, equities, bonds, titles,
    deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be moved and stored
    securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established not by
    powerful intermediaries like banks and governments, but by network consensus,
    cryptography, collaboration, and clever code. For the first time in human history,
    two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each
    other, can forge agreements, make transactions, and build value without relying
    on intermediaries (such as banks, rating agencies, and government bodies such
    as the U.S. Department of State) to verify their identities, establish trust,
    or perform the critical business logic—contracting, clearing, settling, and record-keeping
    tasks that are foundational to all forms of commerce.

    all, most financial intermediaries themselves rely on a dizzying, complex, and
    costly array of intermediaries to run their own operations. Santander, a European
    bank, put the potential savings at $20 billion a year.^([2](#chapter7-2)) Capgemini,

    and insurance fees each year through blockchain-based applications.^([3](#chapter7-3))

    do more with less, streamline their businesses, and reduce risk in the process.
    But while an opportunistic viewpoint is advantageous and often necessary, it is
    rarely sufficient. After all, how do you cut cost from a business or market whose
    structure has fundamentally changed? Here, blockchain is a real game changer.

    companies target angel investors in the early stages of a new business, and later
    look to venture capitalists, eventually culminating in an initial public offering
    (IPO) on a stock exchange. This industry supports a number of intermediaries,
    such as investment bankers, exchange operators, auditors, lawyers, and crowdfunding
    platforms (such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo). Blockchain changes the equation
    by enabling companies of any size to raise money in a peer-to-peer way, through
    global distributed share offerings. This new funding mechanism is already transforming
    the blockchain industry. In 2016 blockchain companies raised $400 million from
    traditional venture investors and nearly $200 million through what we call initial
    coin offerings (ICO rather than IPO). These ICOs aren’t just new cryptocurrencies
    masquerading as companies. They represent content and digital rights management
    platforms (such as SingularDTV), distributed venture funds (such as The DAO, for
    decentralized autonomous organization), and even new platforms to make investing
    in ICOs and managing digital assets easy (such as ICONOMI). There is already a
    deep pipeline of ICOs, such as Cosmos, a unifying technology that will connect
    every blockchain in the world, which is why it’s been dubbed the “internet of
    blockchains.” Others are sure to follow suit.

    one of the industry’s largest investors, recently announced that it would be raising
    money for its new fund by issuing tokens by ICO, a first for the industry. And,
    of course, companies such as Goldman Sachs; Nasdaq, Inc.; and Intercontinental
    Exchange, the American holding company that owns the New York Stock Exchange,
    which dominate the IPO and listing business, have been among the largest investors
    in blockchain ventures.

    no regulatory oversight. Due diligence and disclosures can be scant, and some
    companies that have issued ICOs have gone bust. Caveat emptor is the watchword,
    and many of the early backers are more punters than funders. But the genie has
    been unleashed from the bottle. Done right, ICOs can not only improve the efficiency
    of raising money, lowering the cost of capital for entrepreneurs and investors,
    but also democratize participation in global capital markets.

    imagine that the new cryptocurrencies, for all the hype, will make national currencies
    redundant. By and large they are right, because conventional money actually does
    a pretty good job. The U.S. dollar and other reserve currencies have historically
    performed well as a medium of exchange and as a store of value—the two principal
    functions of a currency. Bitcoin and its derivatives perform poorly on both accounts

    disruption to the financial system. Traditional economists (and, yes, that label
    could well describe both of us) often ignore a crucial separation between money
    (the “what”) and the payment technology (the “how”). This confusion originates
    in the fact that for older forms of money—gold or bank notes—there is no distinction

    platforms. Over the past 20 years the economy has progressively moved away from
    the traditional model of centralized organizations, where large operators, often
    with a dominant position, were responsible for providing a service to a group
    of passive consumers. Today we are moving toward a new model of increasingly decentralized
    organizations, where large operators are responsible for aggregating the resources
    of multiple people to provide a service to a much more active group of consumers.

    free to register a product on the platform, which will become visible to all users
    connected to the network. Once a buyer agrees to the price for that product, an
    escrow account is created on the bitcoin blockchain that requires two out of three
    people (that is, the buyer, the seller, and a potential third-party arbitrator)
    to agree for the funds to be released (a so-called multisignature account). Once
    the buyer has sent the payment to the account, the seller ships the product; after
    receiving the product, the buyer releases the funds from the escrow account. Only
    if there is an issue between the two does the system require the intervention
    of a third party (for example, a randomly selected arbitrator) to decide whether
    to release the payment to the seller or whether to return the money to the buyer.

    fees on payment portals like PayPal. All of these fees increase the cost of goods

    try to get access to customer data by paying third parties (like Facebook) to
    share information. But blockchain could allow merchants to use micropayments to
    motivate consumers to share personal information—directly, without going through
    an intermediary. For example, a grocery store chain with a mobile app can pay
    users $1 for installing the app in their phones, plus an extra $1 if they allow
    it to enable location tracking. Every time they open the app and spend at least
    a minute on it, the retailer can pay them a few cents or loyalty points’ worth
    of store credit, up to a maximum per day. During that time, they push deals and
    special offers to the user. Indeed, user-tailored deals open a legitimate mechanism
    to deliver personalized prices that are a function of the consumer’s profile.

    themselves off the menu by launching their own companies within the existing industry
    model. The same is true in music, too. For example, Grammy-award-winning singer-songwriter
    Imogen Heap has been a pioneer in the field with the launch of Mycelia, a think-and-do
    tank whose goal is “to empower a fair, sustainable and vibrant music industry
    ecosystem involving all online music interaction services,” using blockchain.
    Artlery, a company founded by technologists and artists, is attempting the same
    thing for physical art such as sculptures and paintings. But for most artists
    and creators, that’s not an option.

    Blockchain is a new technology platform, running on millions of devices and open
    to anyone, where not just information but anything of value—money, titles, and
    deeds, but also music, art, scientific discoveries, and other intellectual property—can
    be moved and stored securely and privately, where trust is established not by
    powerful intermediaries like movie studios, streaming services, banks, or other
    companies, but rather through mass collaboration and clever code.

    in a centralized paradigm foster,” writes Zach LeBeau, CEO of SingularDTV, a blockchain-based
    digital content management and distribution platform. His vision is to decentralize
    the entertainment industry so that creative individuals can profit from the films,
    videos, games, and art they help to make. He expects decentralization to “realize
    a world that utilizes the greatest potential of every person.”
