    The perception layer comprises sensors, actuators, and embedded devices that are
    integrated into things. The perception layer interacts with the real world, enables
    basic signal and data processing, and assures some form of connectivity (personal-area
    with Bluetooth or wired connections, local-area with WiFi, or wide-area with,
    e.g., Narrow-band IoT (NB-IoT)). The embedded device can thus attach directly
    or via a communication gateway to the communication layer, which is a public (Internet)
    or private IP network. The platform and the application layer are two sets of
    cloud-based services that enable the collection, storage, data processing, and
    the development of applications based on IoT data. Integration of IoT and DLT
    has long been seen as a remedy for the fundamental challenges of IoT architectures.
    The challenges, such as centralized ecosystems, cost of the connectivity, disrupted
    business models, security and trust, and lack of functional values, need to be
    addressed to continue with successful practical IoT deployments.

    of the technological and business-related scope of distributed ledger technology
    and unrealistic presumptions. For example, distributed ledger technology does
    not solve scalability problems of IoT. On the contrary, all relevant DLT deployments
    struggle to meet even a fraction of the capabilities (in terms of transactions
    per second and latency) of the current cloud-based IoT backend platforms. However,
    if the real benefits of the distributed ledger technology are understood, IoT
    DApps can be properly designed and carved, and the technology can be applied to
    situations where it can disrupt business operations. DLT opens vast opportunities
    for innovation and paradigm shifts in IoT [[47](9783110681123_008192.xhtml#b_9783110681130-005_ref_047)].
    Currently, we have production-grade systems capable of reliable IoT data collection
    or secure processing of tens of thousands of financial transactions. In most cases,
    the DLT struggles to meet the performance of centralized systems and is far from
    superseding them. Similarly, a single point of failure of a cloud application
    is merely a consequence of poor design and implementation. Cloud-based architectures
    leveraged by content distribution networks, platform virtualization, and application
    balancing and scaling can provide extremely reliable services. In 5 G networks,
    mechanisms for new service architectures are foreseen. A combination of cloud,
    edge, and mobile computing enables distributed (but not decentralized!) service
    deployment. Along with network-intrinsic resource assurance through network slices,
    they can support energy-efficient, massive, or time-sensitive IoT applications.

    DL, IoT, and the underlying communication networks. In the traditional IoT architecture
    ([Fig. 3.1](#b_9783110681130-003_fig_001)), the IoT is considered merely an overlay
    on the communication infrastructure. The recent trends in 4 G already anticipate
    fog-/edge-based approaches, where some of the application and data logic is moved
    from the cloud into or closer to the IoT end-devices. In 5 G architectures, additional
    mechanisms (e.g., slicing) are foreseen to support the QoS or security in such
    a network architecture. Therefore, the next step in integration should be the
    organization and deployment of the appropriate DL network and DApp architecture
    to the fog, edge, and cloud-based communication infrastructure. Unlike DeFi applications,
    many of the IoT-related DApps do not require public or permissionless DL networks.
    This opens possibilities for novel DL network architectures, combining private,
    consortium, and public DL networks (see Section 2.3.1.1) implemented in the network
    edge or overlay services, and integrated by cross-chain swaps (Section 2.3.3.3).

    applications. The denial might affect only selected network nodes or network participants.
    Besides the DL network, there are few decentralized entities in the system that
    are prone to traditional distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks

    personal identity to create a new blockchain account. This keeps them private
    as persons, but the account activities, including the cryptocurrency balance,
    are public. Public DL networks are, therefore, pseudo-anonymous. Frequently, for

    to enable privacy preservation in blockchain, including secure multi-party computation,
    commitment schemes, ZK-SNARK, ZK-STARK, ring signatures, and homomorphic hiding.

    and authorize devices for access control in an off-chain service. In this case,
    the purpose of the decentralized application is to securely grant a device, a
    user, or a backend system, the appropriate identification and authentication information,

    is then used to authenticate a given entity and to manage the service access.
    Apart from identification and authentication information, in this way, we can

    know them today. It uses new types of transactions to grant, get, delegate, or
    revoke access to users. Scripting language to express fine‐grained and contextual
    access control policies is enveloped inside these transactions. An access token
    is required to obtain access to a protected resource. A transaction does not deliver
    the access token until the requester fulfills all access control conditions already
    described with the model and included in the transaction. As a proof of concept
    of this idea, two access control models (identity and permissioned access control
    models) have been used in the implementation.

    processes, because they are already familiar with OAuth. Using blockchain, the

    information, and guarantees the reliability of the authentication and authorization
    processes. The system is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Three types of smart

    capable of running all blockchain protocols as a full or as a light client. The
    device is attached to the DL client API to avail the DL functions provided by
    the gateway. The architecture in this figure assumes that the device can securely
    keep its key-store. The device is also capable enough to build and sign transactions
    and communicate through the DL client API with the DL edge gateway/node.

    protocols and has no access to the blockchain key-store. It cannot directly take
    any of the blockchain-specific actions and runs no blockchain protocols. A transaction
    requester only assembles data for submission, communicates it with a network node,
    which then issues the transaction on its behalf. Thus, the transaction requester
    relies on a gateway device, which integrates the traditional IoT protocol principles
    with a blockchain operation.

    communicates with the edge gateway through a proprietary communication interface,
    which is in no way related to DL. The device also possesses no DL-related credentials.
    All functions, including the DL transaction creation, are done in the application
    logic of the edge gateway, where the key-store is also kept. This can vastly reduce
    the requirements imposed on the device. However, the IoT device does not directly
    benefit now from any decentralized trust enhancements and must fully trust the
    edge gateway.

    and computation constraints and are often the only viable approaches to include
    a constrained IoT device in decentralized applications. However, we need to be
    aware that this reduces the decentralization of the system. Therefore, a possible
    unfavorable impact on overall trust may not be neglected.

    combines distributed ledger technology with collaborative robotics. This proof
    of concept enables innovative IoT machine autonomy use cases in manufacturing
    environments, such as servitization and robotics-as-a-service. As an illustrative
    example, a 3-D printer can offer its printing capabilities to other actors in
    the system. Machines or other actors can place an order for such a service. The
    service negotiation is then autonomously conducted through blockchain transactions
    and smart contracts. The printing machine records the process of production. This
    is used as a confirmation of the work done and is recorded in the blockchain.
    The basic use case diagram is depicted in [Fig. 3.7](#b_9783110681130-003_fig_007).

    interface the blockchain system through the applications in single-board computers.
    Trusted machines are oracles that provide data to smart contracts from the external

    Therefore, the required system data was split into three categories: obligatory,
    auxiliary, and large or binary objects. The key items are implemented as smart
    contract parameters. These are the obligatory parameters for minimum system functionality;
    for example, order IDs or machine addresses. Some additional parameters are placed
    in the transaction data field as a JSON string. They, too, are kept in the blockchain,
    but their structure can be adapted without directly affecting the smart contract
    code. This allows for some flexibility; for example, adding new parameter fields
    to a description of a machine or a user. The large or binary objects, for example,
    printer configuration files, image and video proofs of manufacturing, etc., are
    not kept in the blockchain because of their size. Instead, they are placed on
    the off-chain storage servers, and only their hash values are set in the chain.'

    A Proof of Authority consortium-based blockchain network was set up to overcome
    some of the performance and cost limitations of blockchain and IoT. Block time
    was set to 3 s, which is substantially less than in, for example, a public Ethereum
    network. This allows for better transaction throughput and lower latency. Besides,
    the PoA mechanism provides very predictable block times and is not energy-consuming.
    The network runs the smart contract platform. The UI and MI access the blockchain
    capabilities through the access nodes that are HTTP RPC enabled.
