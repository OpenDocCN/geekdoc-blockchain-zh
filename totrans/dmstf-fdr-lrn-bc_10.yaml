- en: The concept of “twin” was introduced by NASA's Apollo program, which designed
    and manufactured two real identical space vehicles. One of them was launched into
    the air space to perform the mission, while the other remained on Earth, agreeing
    engineers to mirror the conditions of the launched one (Boschert & Rosen, 2016).
    In the white paper written by Grieves (Glaegen & Stargel, 2012), the Digital Twins
    was first projected at his executive course on product lifecycle management (PLM).
    With technical enhancements, the DT was introduced into the aerospace industry
    by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and U.S. Air Force (Tuegel
    et al., 2011). Consequently, the space vehicle remaining on Earth could be replaced
    by a digital mirror model to provide more insights through high-fidelity simulation.
    Nowadays, the DT has been applied to more fields and has become a most demanding
    technology. In the figure:1 the complete development history of DT can be divided
    into three stages.

    by Grieves in 2003 according to the Whitepaper written by him (Glaegen & Stargel,
    2012). It was explained in three dimensions, including a physical entity, a digital
    counterpart, and a linking that connect the two parts together (Glaegen & Stargel,
    2012).

    be classified into three subtypes, including: DT prototype, DT instance, and DT
    aggregate (Tac, 2012). However, due to technical and perceptive limitations, we
    are having very few related reports in the following 5 years. But fortunately,
    during this period, the New IT has arisen and developed, which established the
    frameworks for the future development of the Digital Twins.'

    vehicles in detail in the Draft Modelling, Simulation, Information Technology
    and Processing Roadmap (Allare, 2014). In 2011, the U.S. Air Force discovered
    the application of DT in the mechanical health management of aircrafts (Reifinider
    & Majumdar, 2013). In 2012, NASA and the U.S. Air Force jointly issued a paper
    about the Digital Twins, which expressed that the Digital Twin was the critical
    innovation for future vehicles (Tuegel et al., 2011). After that, the number of
    research studies on the DT in aerospace has improved gradually. For example, Tuegel
    proposed the Airframe Digital Twins for design and maintenance, and deliberated
    the challenges for its development (Swedberg, n.d.). Allaire et al. researched
    a dynamic data-driven application system, which was portrayed as the execution
    establishment of the DT for aerospace vehicles (Menard, n.d.). Reifsnider and
    Majumdar introduced a multidisciplinary physics-based approach for the DT in taskforce
    management (Science Service Dr. Hempel Digital Health Network, n.d.).

    structure of DT was widely revealed. Subsequently, the DT was spread the word
    about for more fields beyond the aerospace business, for example, automotive (Panetta,
    2017), oil and gas (Panetta, 2017), and healthcare and medicine (Murray, 2018).
    In recent years, many recognized organizations have introduced great importance
    to the DT. Both in 2017 and 2018, Gartner stared the DT as one of the top 10 most
    auspicious technological trends in the next decade (13,14]. In 2017, Lockheed
    Martin Space Systems Company listed the DT as the top of six protruding technologies
    for future defence and aerospace (Tao, 2017). Smart Manufacturing Association
    of China Association for Science and Technology indicated that the DT was one
    of the best 10 logical and innovative advances for smart manufacturing in the
    world (Tao, 2017b). Based on the current inclination, it can be expected that
    the DT will experience a rapid development in the next few years.

    where all the physical objects will have embedded computing and communication
    capabilities so that they can sense the atmosphere and connect with each other
    to provide the services. These intelligent interconnections and interoperability
    are also termed as loT or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications (Tao, 2017a).
    Some of the important areas of a smart city are the smart energy, smart home,
    smart transport system. and smart manufacturing. Because of the affordability
    and availability of the sensors and actuators, data acquisition has become relatively
    easier. Monitoring and diagnosing the manufacturing machines through the Internet
    is a challenging task. The convergence of the physical and virtual worlds of manufacturing
    is still one of the major challenges in the field of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
    which needs more research. To confront these challenges, Industry 4.0 was conceptualized
    (Tao, 2017), which revealed that if the production systems are made intelligent
    and smart, they can function more competently (Tao et al., 2018; Tao, 2017b).
    There have been many developments to enable this, one of which is digital twin
    (Machine-to-Machine Communications, 2015).

    asset for predictive maintenance. This model will continually adapt to changes
    in the environment or operation using real-time sensory data and can forecast
    the future of the corresponding physical assets (Schuh et al., 2017). It can monitor
    and recognize expected issues with its physical twin. In addition, it allows the
    prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the physical twin by leveraging
    a combination of physics-based models and data-driven analytics. It consists of
    three main parts: (i) physical products in real space (ii) virtual products in
    virtual space, and (iii) the connections of data and information that will tie
    the virtual and real products together. Therefore, collecting and analysing a
    large volume of manufacturing data to find the information and connections has

- en: It is known that the Digital Twin is a replication process that makes full use
    of physical models, sensors, past data of operation, etc. to assimilate information
    of multi-discipline, scale and probability. It assists as a replication process
    for physical products in virtual space. There are presently many diverse understandings
    of the concept of digital twins, and a consensus definition has not yet been defined.
    Though, it is common thought that physical entities, virtual models, data, connections
    and services are the fundamental elements of digital twins (Tao et al., 2019).
    The core of digital twins is a bi-directional mapping relationship that occurs
    between physical space and virtual space. This bi-directional mapping is different
    to the unidirectional mapping. The uni-directional mapping maps data in one direction
    i.e. from physical entities to digital objects. It is also known as digital shadow
    (Kritzinger, 2018) In this case “a change in state of the physical object leads
    to a change in the digital object, but not vice versa.” (Kritzinger, 2018) Though,
    digital twins empower virtual objects to control physical entities without human
    intervention (Enders & Hoßbach, 2019), which is a characteristic that digital
    shadows do not have.

    realtime linking between the virtual and the real, the digital twin can plot the
    physical entities and attributes, structure, state, performance, function and
    behaviour of systems to the virtual world (Tao et al., 2019) creating a high-fidelity
    dynamic multidimensional, multi-scale, multi-physical quantity model, which will
    offer an actual way for observing, recognizing, understanding, controlling and
    converting the physical world (Tao et al., 2019).

    manufacturing design, and later arose in different industries such as aerospace,
    automation, shipbuilding, medical and energy. In recent years, with the quick
    advancement of technologies and industries such as the Internet of Things(IoT),
    big data (Tao et al., 2019), cloud computing and artificial intelligence(AI),
    the construction basis of smart city has progressively advanced from the original
    static 3D modelling level towards the digital twin level that combines dynamic
    digital technology and static 3D model,, which frames another idea that digital
    twin city assists smart city construction.

    concept at the city level. It targets at constructing a complex giant system between
    the physical world and the virtual space that can plan each other and incorporate
    with each other in both directions. It can match the physical city to the paralleled
    “twin city”, creating a pattern of coexistence of both and incorporation of physical
    cities in the physical dimension and digital cities in the information dimension.
    The building of a digital twin city requires a data foundation and a technical
    foundation. The data foundation refers to the huge urban big data that is uninterruptedly
    generated every day from various sensors and cameras everywhere in the city, as
    well as the digital subsystems consecutively built by the municipal management
    departments.

    computing, big data, and AI, including 5G. In a digital twin city, the data of
    functioning status of infrastructure, the placement of municipal resources, and
    the flow of people, logistics and vehicles will be composed through sensors, cameras,
    and various digital subsystems. With technologies including 5G transporting them
    to the cloud and the city government, the city will be well-organized. The building
    of digital twin cities will trigger great innovations in urban intelligent planning,
    management and services, and converted a “new starting point” for the construction
    of smart cities. This will help accomplish the goal of imagining of all-element
    information of the city and the intelligent city planning, management and services.
    The digital twin city is not only the goal of a digital city, but also a key component
    of a smart city. It is a significant facility and basic ability that enable the
    city to realize smartness. It is also a landmark in the transformation of urban
    informatization from qualitative variation to quantitative variation determined
    by technology, which provides the creation of smart cities more room for innovation.

    accomplishment, they will become more environmentally, economically and socially

    would conquest traditional approaches. Digital twin experts have replied that
    while Computer Aided Design currently designs and provide visions regarding the
    design process – the digital twin would offer the same thing but also a physical
    corresponding item with which they can interact. Having a corresponding part would
    enable the designers to predict any potential problem. Relating virtual technology
    with smart maps driven by geospatial analytics is alternative prime example of
    how this innovation betters’ current practices. The purpose of these maps is to
    lodge users in visualizing, processing, and analysing multiple, large and complex
    geo referenced data. Again, the digital twin proposes the same service, but it
    also represents an in-service physical object, which forcefully changes in neighbouring
    real-time as the state of the physical object changes.

    of the data cloud platform, analysis system, response system and user terminals
    (Li et al. 2020) (Figure 8). The patient spatiotemporal data is formed by blend
    of the patient information provided by the hospital information system of major
    hospitals and the patient’s spatiotemporal route data provided by the communication
    operator, which is kept in the patient spatiotemporal database. This database
    can be associated to the spatiotemporal data cloud platform and linked to the
    epidemic big data analysis system. The analysis system uses spatiotemporal contiguity
    analysis, AI analysis and other technologies to regulate the occurrence of the
    epidemic and determine the people in close contact, and the results will be transmitted
    to the response system. The response system connects with government departments,
    employers and individual users, provides the government with a reference for epidemic
    avoidance and control, the employers with a reference for employees’ health condition
    testimonies, and individuals with information services for self-isolation and
    protection.

    Blockchain technology is the best solution. IoT sensors accumulate and monitor
    the patient’s health data, such as pulse rate, blood sugar level, heart rate,
    respiratory rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. After that the administrators
    monitor the composed data and generate the patient’s report. The received report
    is analysed by the doctors who then endorse the required treatment. Doctors may
    share the treatment reports using a distributed database for further analysis.
    The authorized report is shared in an encrypted format. The patient claims the

    In vehicle networks, vehicles can communicate with the roadside unit or with each
    other without the participation of any central authority. However, in such an
    independent environment, challengers might inject ambiguous or false information
    to exploit personal benefits. Therefore, vehicle authentication is required to
    guarantee secure data exchange between these vehicles. In order to do this, IoT
    sensors gather and monitor the information of vehicles, such as model size, speed,
    driving direction, and load. Then the distributed network nodes monitor the composed
    data and produce a real-time package for communicating. The received package will
    be used to calculate the behaviours of vehicles. The process of sharing will be
    recorded on a “CSP.” Vehicles request the “CSP” for retrieve the information associated
    with them.

    products, but the entities (e.g., retailers, distributors, transporters, and suppliers)
    in these supply chains have very limited knowledge about the product lifecycle.
    However, such product information is necessary as the customers require the information
    to develop their trust, and entities require the information to make business
    decisions or foresee market trends. Blockchain technology in digital twin cities
    can be a solution. Blockchains track the complete product information, avert the
    entry of bogus products into the market, and share information amongst various
    entities to optimize the decision-making process. In the process of doing this,
    IoT sensors gather and monitor the information of entities, such as logistics,
    specifications, affiliation, and value. The distributed network nodes monitor
    the composed data and produce a real-time package for communicating. The received
    package will be used to analyse the behaviours of vehicles. The process of sharing
    will be recorded on a “CSP.” Retailers, distributors, transporters, and suppliers
    can retrieve the “CSP” for access to the information associated with them. After

    conditions in rivers and lakes, rain conditions in urban atmospheric stations
    and dynamic trajectories of people and vehicles from monitoring and collection
    equipment such as ground sensors. This can be comprehended grounded on satellite
    remote sensing technology in large-scale air and sky states to monitor cloud and

- en: As a new model for building smart cities, the digital twin will reform the city
    governance structures and rules and shoot up a continuous momentum for the growth
    and transformation of cities. Many of the developed cities around the world are
    planning to build and launch digital twin cities. The speedy development of digital
    twin technologies is one of the reasons to construct digital twin cities. The
    development of digital twin will create a new management design that can trace
    past events and explore frontier guidelines, which will be a trend for future
    research on Digital Twin Cities. The digital twin city is certainly a new beginning
    point for the construction of modern smart cities. Smart cities built on digital
    twins have extensive prospects for economic transformation, urban smart management
    and public smart services, so that man and nature can grow more co-ordinately.
    The comprehension of smart cities needs the creation of more complete altitudinal
    information organization to ensure that various smart city applications can be
    used well and affordable. The big data problem of smart cities carries new opportunities
    and challenges. It is necessary to do a good job in technological revolution and
    research in order to promote the development of the digital service industry,
    and develop the digital economy. The building of smart city is a leading project.
    It is essential to do a top-level design and overall planning according to the
    characteristics of each city, and begin a smart city operation centre and operation
    brain to make the city smart.
