    anymore—how much is produced; it is about distribution—how people get a share

    on the basis of the online choices of people like you. These works explain how
    “software is eating the world,” as the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has
    observed, and how Google’s search and other software constitute an “artificial
    intelligence” (AI) that is nothing less than “the biggest event in human history.”
    Google AI offers uncanny “deep machine learning” algorithms that startled even
    its then chairman, Eric Schmidt, by outperforming him and other human beings in
    identifying cats in videos. Such feats of “deep mind” recounted in these books
    emancipate computers from their dependence on human intelligence and soon will
    “know you better than you know yourself.”

    2010s with most of its profits devolving to Google, Apple, and Facebook, however,
    it appeared to be undergoing a nervous breakdown, manifested on one level by delusions
    of omnipotence and transcendence and on another by twitchy sieges of “security”
    instructions on consumers’ devices. In what seemed to be arbitrary patterns, programs
    asked for new passwords, user names, PINs, log-ins, crypto-keys, and registration
    requirements. With every webpage demanding your special attention, as if it were
    the Apple of your i, you increasingly found yourself in checkmate as the requirements
    of different programs and machines conflicted, and as scantily-identified boxes
    popped up on your screen asking for “your password,” as if you had only one.

    “free,” as the Internet was not a vehicle for transactions. When all it was doing
    was displaying Web pages, transmitting emails, running discussion forums and news
    groups, and hyperlinking academic sites, the Net did not absolutely need a foundation
    of security. But when the Internet became a forum for monetary transactions, new
    security regimes became indispensable. EBay led the way by purchasing PayPal,
    which was not actually an Internet service but an outside party that increased
    the efficiency of online transactions. Outside parties require customer information
    to be transmitted across the Web to consummate transactions. Credit card numbers,

    (or “apps”). Amazon has largely succeeded in isolating its own domains and linking
    to outside third parties such as credit card companies. But these centralized
    fortresses violated the Coase Theorem of corporate reach. In a famous paper, the
    Nobel-laureate economist Ronald Coase calculated that a business should internalize
    transactions only to the point that the costs of finding and contracting with
    outside parties exceed the inefficiencies incurred by the absence of real prices,
    internal markets, and economies of scale.[⁶](notes.html#ch01note-6) The concentration
    of data in walled gardens increases the cost of security. The industry sought
    safety in centralization. But centralization is not safe.
