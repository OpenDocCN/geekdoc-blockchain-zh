  zh: 最初的分布式互联网架构在一切都是“免费”时就足够了，因为互联网并非用于交易。当它只是显示网页、传输电子邮件、运行讨论论坛和新闻组，以及在学术站点之间建立超链接时，网络并不绝对需要安全的基础。但当互联网成为货币交易的平台时，新的安全制度变得不可或缺。eBay通过收购PayPal走在了前面，PayPal实际上并不是一个互联网服务，而是一个外部方，增加了在线交易的效率。外部方需要将客户信息通过网络传输以完成交易。信用卡号、安全代码、过期日期和密码开始在网络上泛滥。
- en: With the ascendancy of Amazon, Apple, and other online emporia early in the
    twenty-first century, much of the Internet was occupied with transactions, and
    the industry retreated to the “cloud.” Abandoning the distributed Internet architecture,
    the leading Silicon Valley entrepreneurs replaced it with centralized and segmented
    subscription systems, such as Paypal, Amazon, Apple’s iTunes, Facebook, and Google
    cloud. Uber, Airbnb, and other sequestered “unicorns” followed.

  zh: 随着亚马逊、苹果和其他在线商城在21世纪初的崛起，互联网的大部分内容都被交易所占据，行业转向了“云端”。放弃了分布式互联网架构，领先的硅谷企业家们将其替换为中心化和分段式的订阅系统，例如Paypal、亚马逊、苹果的iTunes、Facebook和谷歌云。随之而来的还有Uber、Airbnb等被隔离的“独角兽”。
- en: These so-called “walled gardens” might have sufficed if they could have actually
    been walled off from the rest of the Internet. At Apple, Steve Jobs originally
    attempted to accomplish such a separation by barring third-party software applications
    (or “apps”). Amazon has largely succeeded in isolating its own domains and linking
    to outside third parties such as credit card companies. But these centralized
    fortresses violated the Coase Theorem of corporate reach. In a famous paper, the
    Nobel-laureate economist Ronald Coase calculated that a business should internalize
    transactions only to the point that the costs of finding and contracting with
    outside parties exceed the inefficiencies incurred by the absence of real prices,
    internal markets, and economies of scale.[⁶](notes.html#ch01note-6) The concentration
    of data in walled gardens increases the cost of security. The industry sought
    safety in centralization. But centralization is not safe.

  zh: 这些所谓的“有围墙的花园”如果能够真正与互联网的其他部分隔离开来，或许已经足够了。在苹果公司，史蒂夫·乔布斯最初试图通过禁止第三方软件应用程序（或“应用程序”）来实现这种分隔。亚马逊在很大程度上成功地将其自有域与外部第三方（如信用卡公司）联系起来。但是这些集中式堡垒违反了企业覆盖范围的科斯定理。在一篇著名的论文中，诺贝尔经济学奖得主罗纳德·科斯计算出，企业应该将交易内部化，直到寻找和与外部方达成合同的成本超过因缺乏真实价格、内部市场和规模经济而产生的低效率为止。在有围墙的花园中的数据集中增加了安全成本。该行业试图在集中化中寻求安全。但是集中化并不
- en: The company store was not a great advance of capitalism during the era of so-called
    “robber barons,” and it is no better today when it is dispersed through the cloud,
    funded through advertising, and combined with a spurious sharing of free goods.
    Marxism was historically hyperbolic the first time round, and the new Marxism
    is delusional today. It is time for a new information architecture for a globally
    distributed economy.

  zh: 公   公司商店在所谓“铁路大亨”时代并没有对资本主义有所推进，如今随着它通过云端分散、通过广告资助，并与虚假共享免费商品相结合，它也不再好了。当年马克思主义的夸张已经是历史性的，而今天的新马克思主义更是幻想。现在是为全球分布式经济构建新的信息架构的时候了。
