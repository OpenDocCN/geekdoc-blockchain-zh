- en: When we discuss the future of computing, Blockchain and Quantum computing emerge
    out as the two most interesting, promising as well as controversial computing
    paradigm. While blockchain is already being used across industries and adoption
    is growing faster, quantum computing is making headlines and approaching fast
    towards becoming reality in the near future.

- en: We have witnessed how the web and the Internet of information has shaped the
    world around us. In a similar manner the Internet of values, driven by Blockchain
    technology, is adding unimaginable values to every bit if life around us. Blockchain
    is a decentralized permission-less distributed ledger technology across peer-to-peer
    networks where the nodes of the network embed trust amongst themselves. Blockchain
    technology has revolutionized the businesses and operations across industry segments.
    The Inherent attributes and characteristics of the blockchain technology solves
    most critical issues of trust and transparency and thus makes it suitable for
    almost every business and industry domain. At the time when different industries
    are adopting blockchain and implementing it to make operations more efficient
    and secure, the quantum computing is evolving silently and poses a threat to the
    classical blockchain technology. Quantum computer uses qubits, quantum bits, rather
    than traditional digital bits that can solve the highly difficult computational
    problems with ease and at a lighting fast speed. While ttraditional computers,
    often called as classical computers, performs calculations on bits that are either
    1s or 0s, quantum computers work on qubits. A concept of quantum physics called
    quantum super positioning, permits these bits to simultaneously exist in both
    states at the same time. Additionally, unlike classical bits, qubits can affect
    each other at the time of processing, through a phenomenon called quantum entanglement,
    that generates one, large quantum state for the whole computing system. Every
    time a qubit is added to the system, the number of potential computing states
    gets doubled and that is what makes quantum computers too powerful compared to
    traditional computing machines.

    have incredible potential to affect the cryptographic system and that’s what poses
    a threat to the existing blockchain systems. The security, integrity, and transparency
    of the blockchain to a larger extent depends on cryptographic procedures. For
    example, digital signatures, based on public key cryptography, are used to authenticate
    a transaction whereas data immutability is achieved by the hashing based on symmetric
    key cryptography. Speed of quantum computing and quantum algorithms poses a real
    threat to the very foundation of the blockchain technology i.e. cryptography and
    hashing. It makes digital signatures used in the blockchain technology susceptible
    to quantum threat. The asymmetric cryptography works on the basis of mathematical
    relation between key pairs. A private-public key pair is generated, and private
    key is kept secret, whereas public key is made available to the public. This permits
    anybody to generate a digital signature using their private key that can be validated
    by anybody with the corresponding public key. This scheme is the very essence
    of the blockchain based BFSI industry to prove authenticity and integrity of transactions.
    The security of asymmetric cryptography is derived the mathematical function called
    a “one-way function”. This function dictates that the public key can be easily
    derived from the private key but not the other way around. All traditional algorithms
    used to derive private key from the public key needs unimaginable huge amount
    of time to do such a computation which is not feasible for any practical purpose.
    However, in 1994, the mathematician Peter Shor designed an algorithm based on
    the quantum computing that can break the common belief regarding the security
    of the most common algorithms of asymmetric cryptography. This suggests that a
    person with a sufficiently large quantum computer could make use this algorithm
    to calculate the private key from its corresponding public key, and thus, forge
    a digital signature. And so, there is an urgent need to address the issues in
    the context of evolving quantum algorithms and computing.

- en: There are two angles to look into the quantum resistant blockchain – one is
    to append guards to the existing already deployed systems called as quantum proofing
    and second is to design a quantum safe blockchain from the very scratch. One of
    the approaches to solve the problem is to replace the existing digital signature
    schemes like RSA or ECDSA with the post quantum signature schemes. We can use
    much bigger public/private keys or digital signatures but then it will create
    further issues for the scalability. Decreasing the size of the signature and public
    /private keys is the most critical issue in designing the quantum resistant blockchain.
    As per blockchain researchers the most feasible and cost-effective way of making
    blockchain safe against quantum attack is to replace the existing RSA or ECDSA
    schemes with post quantum algorithms which works on the basis of computational
    security. Some of the computational security schemes are lattice-based schemes,
    learning with errors, super singular isogenies schemes, multivariate-polynomial
    schemes, code-based schemes, or Merkle tree-based signature schemes. These cryptographic
    schemes are having solid resistance against quantum attacks in the sense that
    till date there is nothing which can compromise security of these schemes. The
    only practical issues is that are computational incentive because of their slightly
    larger key sizes.

    security attacks. As on January 2022, that amounts to approximately $300 billion.
    A quantum computer-based crypto attack can rob trillions of dollars and has the
    potential to throw the global markets and economy into recession and chaos. For
    an example and to be more specific, Shor’s function, when used by a quantum computer,
    can solve for the prime factors that are currently concealed by elliptic-curve
    multiplication and is considered to be impossible to reverse. As per the data
    a typical classical computer requires approximately 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456
    basic operations, to determine a private key associated with a public key utilizing
    elliptic-curve multiplication and this will take thousands of years of time. However,
    a quantum computer that uses Shor’s function would take only 2,097,152 operations
    to figure out the corresponding private key and this can be achieved in just a
    few hours. It’s only a matter of time when such powerful quantum computers will
    become part of mainstream computing but than it is the need of the hour to develop
    blockhead-based systems and solutions which are quantum safe.
