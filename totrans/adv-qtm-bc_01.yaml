- en: When we discuss the future of computing, Blockchain and Quantum computing emerge
    out as the two most interesting, promising as well as controversial computing
    paradigm. While blockchain is already being used across industries and adoption
    is growing faster, quantum computing is making headlines and approaching fast
    towards becoming reality in the near future.

  zh: 讨论未来计算时，区块链和量子计算成为了两种最有趣、最有前景和最具争议的计算范式。虽然区块链已经在各行各业得到应用，并且采用速度正在加快，量子计算则成为头条新闻，并迅速接近在不久的将来成为现实。
- en: We have witnessed how the web and the Internet of information has shaped the
    world around us. In a similar manner the Internet of values, driven by Blockchain
    technology, is adding unimaginable values to every bit if life around us. Blockchain
    is a decentralized permission-less distributed ledger technology across peer-to-peer
    networks where the nodes of the network embed trust amongst themselves. Blockchain
    technology has revolutionized the businesses and operations across industry segments.
    The Inherent attributes and characteristics of the blockchain technology solves
    most critical issues of trust and transparency and thus makes it suitable for
    almost every business and industry domain. At the time when different industries
    are adopting blockchain and implementing it to make operations more efficient
    and secure, the quantum computing is evolving silently and poses a threat to the
    classical blockchain technology. Quantum computer uses qubits, quantum bits, rather
    than traditional digital bits that can solve the highly difficult computational
    problems with ease and at a lighting fast speed. While ttraditional computers,
    often called as classical computers, performs calculations on bits that are either
    1s or 0s, quantum computers work on qubits. A concept of quantum physics called
    quantum super positioning, permits these bits to simultaneously exist in both
    states at the same time. Additionally, unlike classical bits, qubits can affect
    each other at the time of processing, through a phenomenon called quantum entanglement,
    that generates one, large quantum state for the whole computing system. Every
    time a qubit is added to the system, the number of potential computing states
    gets doubled and that is what makes quantum computers too powerful compared to
    traditional computing machines.

  zh: 我们目睹了网络和信息互联网如何塑造了我们周围的世界。类似地，由区块链技术驱动的价值互联网正为我们周围的每一点生活增添着难以想象的价值。区块链是一种跨点对点网络的去中心化无许可分布式分类账技术，在网络节点之间嵌入了信任。区块链技术已经彻底改变了各个行业领域的业务和运营。区块链技术的固有属性和特征解决了大多数关键的信任和透明度问题，因此几乎适用于每个业务和行业领域。在不同行业纷纷采用区块链并将其实施以使运营更加高效和安全的同时，量子计算正在悄然发展，并对经典的区块链技术构成威胁。量子计算机使用量子比特（qubits）而不是传统的数字比特，可以轻松解决高度困难的计算问题，并且速度极快。而传统计算机，通常称为经典计算机，是在只有1或0的比特上进行计算的，而量子计算机则是在量子比特上运行的。量子物理学中的一个概念称为量子叠加，允许这些比特同时在同一时间处于两种状态。此外，与经典比特不同，量子比特在处理过程中可以相互影响，通过一种称为量子纠缠的现象，这为整个计算系统生成一个大型量子状态。每当一个量子比特被添加到系统中，潜在的计算状态数量就会加倍，这就是使量子计算机比传统计算机强大的原因。
- en: Apart from solving the highly complex computing intensive problems quantum computers
    have incredible potential to affect the cryptographic system and that’s what poses
    a threat to the existing blockchain systems. The security, integrity, and transparency
    of the blockchain to a larger extent depends on cryptographic procedures. For
    example, digital signatures, based on public key cryptography, are used to authenticate
    a transaction whereas data immutability is achieved by the hashing based on symmetric
    key cryptography. Speed of quantum computing and quantum algorithms poses a real
    threat to the very foundation of the blockchain technology i.e. cryptography and
    hashing. It makes digital signatures used in the blockchain technology susceptible
    to quantum threat. The asymmetric cryptography works on the basis of mathematical
    relation between key pairs. A private-public key pair is generated, and private
    key is kept secret, whereas public key is made available to the public. This permits
    anybody to generate a digital signature using their private key that can be validated
    by anybody with the corresponding public key. This scheme is the very essence
    of the blockchain based BFSI industry to prove authenticity and integrity of transactions.
    The security of asymmetric cryptography is derived the mathematical function called
    a “one-way function”. This function dictates that the public key can be easily
    derived from the private key but not the other way around. All traditional algorithms
    used to derive private key from the public key needs unimaginable huge amount
    of time to do such a computation which is not feasible for any practical purpose.
    However, in 1994, the mathematician Peter Shor designed an algorithm based on
    the quantum computing that can break the common belief regarding the security
    of the most common algorithms of asymmetric cryptography. This suggests that a
    person with a sufficiently large quantum computer could make use this algorithm
    to calculate the private key from its corresponding public key, and thus, forge
    a digital signature. And so, there is an urgent need to address the issues in
    the context of evolving quantum algorithms and computing.

  zh: 量子计算机除了解决高度复杂的计算密集型问题外，还具有影响加密系统的不可思议潜力，这就对现有的区块链系统构成了威胁。区块链的安全性、完整性和透明性在很大程度上取决于加密程序。例如，基于公钥密码学的数字签名用于认证交易，而数据的不可变性是通过基于对称密钥密码学的哈希实现的。量子计算和量子算法的速度对区块链技术的基础——即加密和哈希——构成了实质性威胁。它使区块链技术中使用的数字签名容易受到量子威胁。非对称加密是基于密钥对之间的数学关系工作的。生成一个私钥-公钥对，私钥保密，而公钥向公众公开。这允许任何人使用他们的私钥生成数字签名，任何人都可以使用相应的公钥验证。这个方案是基于区块链的
    BFSI 行业证明交易的真实性和完整性的核心。非对称加密的安全性是由一个称为“单向函数”的数学函数派生的。这个函数规定了公钥可以很容易地从私钥推导出来，但反过来却不行。从公钥推导出私钥的所有传统算法都需要巨大的计算量来进行这样的计算，这对于任何实际目的来说都是不可行的。然而，1994
    年，数学家 Peter Shor 设计了一种基于量子计算的算法，可以打破关于非对称加密最常见算法安全性的普遍信念。这表明，拥有足够大的量子计算机的人可以利用这个算法从相应的公钥计算出私钥，从而伪造数字签名。因此，迫切需要解决与不断发展的量子算法和计算有关的问题。
- en: There are two angles to look into the quantum resistant blockchain – one is
    to append guards to the existing already deployed systems called as quantum proofing
    and second is to design a quantum safe blockchain from the very scratch. One of
    the approaches to solve the problem is to replace the existing digital signature
    schemes like RSA or ECDSA with the post quantum signature schemes. We can use
    much bigger public/private keys or digital signatures but then it will create
    further issues for the scalability. Decreasing the size of the signature and public
    /private keys is the most critical issue in designing the quantum resistant blockchain.
    As per blockchain researchers the most feasible and cost-effective way of making
    blockchain safe against quantum attack is to replace the existing RSA or ECDSA
    schemes with post quantum algorithms which works on the basis of computational
    security. Some of the computational security schemes are lattice-based schemes,
    learning with errors, super singular isogenies schemes, multivariate-polynomial
    schemes, code-based schemes, or Merkle tree-based signature schemes. These cryptographic
    schemes are having solid resistance against quantum attacks in the sense that
    till date there is nothing which can compromise security of these schemes. The
    only practical issues is that are computational incentive because of their slightly
    larger key sizes.

  zh: 有两个角度可以看待抵御量子攻击的区块链——一是向已经部署的现有系统附加防护措施，称为量子证明，二是从头开始设计一个量子安全的区块链。解决问题的一种方法是用后量子签名方案替换现有的数字签名方案，如RSA或ECDSA。我们可以使用更大的公共/私有密钥或数字签名，但这将进一步引发可扩展性的问题。减小签名和公共/私有密钥的大小是设计量子抗性区块链最关键的问题。根据区块链研究人员的说法，使区块链免受量子攻击的最可行和成本效益的方法是用基于计算安全的后量子算法替换现有的RSA或ECDSA方案。一些计算安全方案是基于格的方案、基于错误学习、超奇异等距方案、多变量多项式方案、基于代码的方案或Merkle树的签名方案。这些密码方案在抵御量子攻击方面具有坚实的抵抗力，迄今为止还没有任何东西能够
    compromise 它们的安全性。唯一的实际问题是计算激励，因为它们稍微更大的密钥大小。
- en: A study by Deloitte states that 25% of bitcoin are at risk of being stolen in
    security attacks. As on January 2022, that amounts to approximately $300 billion.
    A quantum computer-based crypto attack can rob trillions of dollars and has the
    potential to throw the global markets and economy into recession and chaos. For
    an example and to be more specific, Shor’s function, when used by a quantum computer,
    can solve for the prime factors that are currently concealed by elliptic-curve
    multiplication and is considered to be impossible to reverse. As per the data
    a typical classical computer requires approximately 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456
    basic operations, to determine a private key associated with a public key utilizing
    elliptic-curve multiplication and this will take thousands of years of time. However,
    a quantum computer that uses Shor’s function would take only 2,097,152 operations
    to figure out the corresponding private key and this can be achieved in just a
    few hours. It’s only a matter of time when such powerful quantum computers will
    become part of mainstream computing but than it is the need of the hour to develop
    blockhead-based systems and solutions which are quantum safe.

  zh: 德勤的一项研究表明，25%的比特币面临着被安全攻击窃取的风险。截至2022年1月，这大约相当于3000亿美元。基于量子计算机的加密攻击可能会窃取数万亿美元，并有可能使全球市场和经济陷入衰退和混乱。举例来说，当量子计算机使用Shor算法时，可以解出当前由椭圆曲线乘法隐藏的质数因子，而这被认为是不可能逆推的。根据数据，一个典型的经典计算机需要大约340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456个基本操作，来确定与使用椭圆曲线乘法的公钥相关联的私钥，而这需要数千年的时间。然而，一个使用Shor算法的量子计算机只需要2,097,152次操作就可以找出相应的私钥，而这只需要几小时就可以完成。如此强大的量子计算机成为主流计算的一部分只是时间问题，但现在迫切需要开发基于区块链的系统和解决方案，这些解决方案是量子安全的。
