- en: The internet of things (IoT) represents rapid development in research and industry
    that enables both virtual and physical objects to be linked and transfers information
    in order to produce various services that enhance our excellence of life. Traditional
    security and privacy methods are not applicable for IoT, mostly due to their topological
    constraints and versatility of IoT devices. Blockchain technology has started
    to fascinate younger generations because it works especially well in the digital
    world. Blockchain is suitable for internet of things applications. Advancements
    in IoT have propelled distributed systems. The blockchain concept demands a method
    for exchanging and storing data that is managed by a decentralized network. The
    rise of IoT applications is hindered by these obstacles. One option to fix these
    problems is to use a distributed ledger technology using blockchain technology.
    This chapter gives a comprehensive overview of blockchain's strengths and weaknesses
    with its applications.

    The number of IoT devices on the market is reaching 25 billion and is anticipated
    to reach 50 billion by the end of 2025\. These devices feature sensors to connect
    to the network and provide data to a reserved node. Many devices in our daily
    lives are becoming wirelessly compatible with low-power wireless devices. A wide
    range of objects (or physical equipment) may be easily interacted via the IoT,
    including monitoring sensors, household appliances, security cameras and automobiles
    (Khan et al., 2018). These applications leverage massive amounts of data created
    by objects to assist individuals, governments, and businesses.

    (IoT) is a hyper-connected IoT is basically anything connected to the Internet.
    IoT devices are characterized by low power, limited storage, and low computing
    capacity. IoT devices are connected to the internet via “gateways” that allow
    the devices to “talk” to each other. IoT improves the global connectivity of people
    and their surroundings by bringing intelligence and greater efficiency to everything
    in the globe. Many “things” are being connected, thereby increasing the amount
    of data generated. These additional data help to further connect people and the
    environment, therefore enabling us to increase the intelligence of our surroundings.
    For instance, data may be gathered to support tailored services for customers.
    The popular IoT is now seeing fast expansion in both industry and research. A
    large number of well-known companies, like Amazon and Google, have invested billions
    of dollars to construct IoT platforms, like the Amazon AWS IoT and Google Cloud
    IoT (Agrawal et al., 2018).

    and the growth of internet which are leading to difficult security inference.
    This section deals with potential benefits of integrating blockchain with IoT
    architectures. IoT has vast number of nodes at the network edge and they are more
    vulnerable to enormous range of attacks. IoT offers centralized configurations
    for its service availability and which is highly impactful threat. Authorization
    and confidentiality services are also bigger threat because of central failure

    third party based security solutions are provided and are centralized. We can
    achieve better security solutions without utilizing third party support by integrating
    block chain technology. Block chain provides auditability, fault-tolerant design
    and decentralized public key infrastructure for fighting with vast variety of
    attacks, in addition to that it can deliver security to transactive networks such
    as Bitcoin. Blockchain protocols are well capable of preventing unauthorized users
    from DoS attacks because transaction amount is necessary to pay each time while
    making empty transactions. Hence, Blockchain has more powerful techniques to provide
    improved security to the IoT stack. Fig. 1 depicts the Blockchain based IoT Security

    designed for Bitcoin that lets consumers and businesses to store and exchange
    value without financial intermediaries. Transparency, efficiency, and security
    are key features of this new technology. Blockchain technology uses a globally
    distributed ledger to verify and approve transactions. The distributed ledger
    contains immutable, chronologically ordered transaction records that are accessible
    to all network participants. Because blockchain is globally distributed, the historical
    documents cannot be changed without network consensus. Immutable distribution
    promotes network trust.

    three separate parts to the Blockchain decentralized data storage facility, a

    database's file integrity. It also offers transaction auditing, security, and
    authentication features. Blockchains were designed to be resistant to changes
    in data. Since blockchain ledgers are uneditable, they're the ideal choice for
    handling everything that needs to be trusted. This includes recording important
    information (e.g., medical records), providing trustless online identities, and

    the data. (Liu et al., 2018), suggested a blockchain data integrity protocol that

    further transactions from being verified, thereby hindering payments to users.
    It may even reverse transactions, spending bitcoin twice. For bitcoin transactions
    to be settled, nodes or computers are required to first examine newly generated
    blocks. This may follow with a block addition (Sayeed et al., 2019). A public
    ledger of all transactions may be found on the blockchain. Decentralization is
    when no one person or organisation has control, thus that is the case with this

    pre-mines a high-value transaction. On block announcement, he transmits the pre-mined
    block to the exchange. The attacker submits a low-value transaction to the blockchain
    network, which rejects the high-value transaction. As a consequence, the compromised

    Digital stocks, like digital cash, have a real-time value. The stock market is
    struggling with a number of challenges today, including high frequency trading
    and short sales. Many of these problems could be resolved with just an exchange
    where trading was totally done through peer-to-peer (Bhandarkar et al., 2019).
    When purchasing and selling assets and stocks, the traditional method involves
    plenty of additional fees, risk, and several intermediaries. In the face of these
    challenges, blockchain could offer a solution. Blockchain technology will completely
    reshape stock exchange marketing, according to Microsoft. Although banks don't
    actually sell shares, blockchain enables secondary marketplaces to trade shares.

    their food security. E-agriculture focuses on aiding farms in becoming more productive,
    safe, and preventing possible hazards through promoting information exchange about
    farming. Blockchain is capable of making this information exchange more effective.
    In the context of agriculture, using blockchain technology makes it possible to
    increase participants' confidence in each other, which in turn benefits participants'
    agricultural operations by using supplied e-agriculture servers. The new services

    all agriculture-related sectors in a decentralized network. No field officer is
    required to go to the field to check whether the farmer is submitting accurate
    information, for example. If field inspectors and farmers are on the same network,
    both parties can operate rapidly. Because each event is available in a distributed
    network, everyone in the system can easily track its progress. If the weather
    department links in agriculture, the weather authority can warn the farmer. Blockchain

    solution that features an asymmetric key rotation system which can help them to
