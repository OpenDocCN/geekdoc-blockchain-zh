    distant. I’m in the city visiting my aunt and uncle, enjoying the swimming pool
    in their luxury apartment complex and loading up on imported Australian trail
    mix before I head back to the countryside. Along the balconies of people’s high-rise
    apartments are slabs of meat, tied with string. The slabs sway next to shirts
    and sheets left out to dry. Late autumn means it’s time to make *lap yuk*, preserved
    pork, a southern Chinese specialty. A piece of raw pork belly is soaked in a blend
    of rice wine, salt, soy sauce, and spices, then hung out to cure in the damp,
    cold autumn air. The fat becomes translucent and imparts a savory-sweet taste
    to any stir-fried vegetable dish. A relative of mine explains that only southern
    China can make preserved pork like this. The secret is the native, natural spores
    and bacteria in the wind.

    news source. There is a global pig panic and a pig lockdown in rural China, born
    out of biosecurity and the onset of African swine fever (ASF), a disease in pigs
    that causes hemorrhaging. The fatality rate is close to 100 percent, as pigs bleed
    out to their deaths. Headlines in my news feed declare a world on edge. While
    ASF has been in other countries, such as Russia and Belgium, this is the first
    time the fever has been reported in China, the world’s largest pork producer.
    The looming impacts are an unpleasant prospect for economists and politicians.
    Less pork available means higher food prices, and higher food prices means public
    discontent. Historical lessons abound: bread riots have been catalysts for the
    demise of empires, from the French Revolution to the Russian February Revolution.

    in China as far back as 7000 B.C.E., and a 1929 anthropological survey showed
    that 70 percent of animal calorie intake in China was from pork. Within traditional
    Chinese medicine, food itself is medicine, and is crucial to the prevention of
    disease. Pork nourishes the blood and strengthens qi, the vital life force that
    flows through all living beings. Dishes are expected to be a balance of all five
    flavors, for medicinal benefit—sweet, salty, bitter, spicy, sour. Mao Zedong’s
    favorite dish, red braised pork, adheres to this flavor criteria, with the addition
    of extra chilies that signal the spiciness and revolutionary zeal of Mao’s native
    Hunan Province.

    Smithfield, making the WH Group the largest pork producer in the world. It expanded
    WH Group’s operations to a vast network of family farms and industrial operations
    outside of China. These industrial pig farms are an environmental headache for
    the communities that live around them, including states like North Carolina, which
    has launched legislative campaigns against Smithfield. In 2005, Brazil’s minister
    of foreign relations remarked on the rosy Brazil-China relationship as being part
    of the “reconfiguration of the world’s commercial and diplomatic geography.” Brazil
    is poised to be the world’s leader in soybean exports as swaths of the Amazon
    rain forest are deforested for soy farming. Eighty percent of the harvest ends
    up as pig feed, and China is currently the top buyer of Brazilian soy.

    you feed them, you have to buy grain, and then cook the grain, since they won’t
    eat it raw. They’re like humans. Even then, when you sell the pork, you’d never

    one of the many midsize pork farms with fewer than a hundred pigs. Ninety-eight
    percent of the pork farms in China have fewer than fifty animals, and these small
    to midsize farms account for about a third of pork production in China. These
    highly decentralized farms make government oversight difficult. There is also
    enormous pressure for these farms to keep up with the market price for pork, and
    to maintain steady production. The government was finding ASF a convenient excuse
    to eradicate these small farms, making way for centralized, industrial-scale operations.

    Many of us are unable to see this operation—for example, in the United States,
    there are “ag-gag” laws that make it illegal to even photograph industrial feeding
    operations. It’s in this opacity that industrial swill proliferates, keeping prices
    low. This swill is fully *optimized*: the optimal set of nutrients for a pig to
    grow to an appropriate size, to get to market in the optimal time. And so pigs
    unknowingly cannibalize each other, infecting and reinfecting their own kind.'

    industrial pig farming, there is little contact between humans and pigs, and the
    pigs remain behind closed doors, viewable only on closed-circuit TV. Pigs have
    a fragile constitution. One pig farmer told me that pigs can get stressed and
    sick just from a minor change in their drinking water. Even under the best circumstances,
    without the threat of ASF, an industrial pig farm is more like an iPhone factory
    than a bucolic countryside haven. Each herd is watched and monitored on-screen
    for any signs of sickness or disease. When human intervention is required, people

    and degree of precision possible in software—a level of control over every microscopic
    variable along the way, such as pig stress levels. Weiyang’s entire approach is
    crudely transparent—food, like engineers, can be a pipeline and sourcing issue,
    solved through increased vertical integration. NetEase has set up numerous massive
    online open courses (MOOCs) to create a population of skilled workers for recruiting
    directly into their company, addressing the existing shortage of skilled high-tech
    workers. Similarly, Weiyang skips the step of working with sources, instead creating

    Increased agricultural automation has led to pigs becoming physically standardized,
    much like our fruits and vegetables. As with an assembly line in a factory, scaling
    from producing one hundred pigs to a hundred thousand means requiring parts to
    be the same size and type, interchangeable. Before the advent of industrial agriculture
    in China, farmers raised hundreds of pig breeds of different sizes and attributes.
    These pigs were adapted to local climates and diseases, providing a receptacle

    the small scale of pig DNA to the large infrastructural systems of slaughterhouses
    designed to decrease stress (and improve the texture of pork). As ASF unfolds

    AI is technically a subset of machine learning. And within artificial intelligence,
    one of the most exciting areas over the past ten years has been work done on neural
    networks, which are used in deep learning. These artificial neural networks rely
    on models of the brain that have been formalized into mathematical operations.
    Research into these “artificial neurons” began as early as 1943, with a paper
    by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts on the perceptron, an algorithm that modeled
    binary (yes/no) classification, which would serve as the foundation of contemporary
    neural networks.

    on animal brains are still being done in order to understand more complex, generative
    brain functions—like constructing new meanings and relationships, or interpreting
    new experiences. Neurons can be artificially “created” and modeled on a computer,
    but we still do not know how to regenerate human neurons once they die off. While
    artificial neural networks often assume there are only a few types of neurons,
    human neural networks consist of thousands of different types scattered across
    the body, existing even in places like the stomach. Just replicating a single
    brain using computer neural networks doesn’t guarantee an exact mimicking of brain
    function. After all, the process of learning doesn’t reside solely within our
    brains; it’s environmental, physical, and, most of all, social, carried out through
    interaction and dialogue.
