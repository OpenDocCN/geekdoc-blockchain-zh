  zh: 1 引言
- en: The world has witnessed immense evolution in transportation, in the last couple
    of decades. Not only has there been a devastating increase in several vehicles
    in the last few years, but also technology has turned traditional vehicles into
    smart vehicles, capable of sharing and collecting data. The smart vehicles are
    assigned with IP addresses to connect to Internet and the fellow vehicles on the
    fly. Also, many IoT sensors are installed within vehicles to gather information.
    Moreover, the rapid growth in the usage of vehicles, IoT devices, has increased
    the need for vehicle-to-vehicle communication and upgraded vehicle to infrastructure,
    vehicle to Internet, vehicle to pedestrian, vehicle to personal devices, and intra
    vehicular communications.

  zh: 过去几十年，世界见证了交通运输的巨大发展。 不仅近年来车辆数量急剧增加，而且技术已将传统车辆转变为智能车辆，能够共享和收集数据。 智能车辆被分配了IP地址，以便与互联网和其他车辆进行连接。
    此外，许多物联网传感器安装在车辆内部以收集信息。 此外，车辆、物联网设备的迅速增长增加了车辆之间的通信需求，并升级了车辆与基础设施、车辆与互联网、车辆与行人、车辆与个人设备以及车内通信。
- en: As a result, normal transportation has undergone an intense innovation and got
    transformed into smart transportation framework called Internet of Vehicles (IoV).
    IoV is a network of different entities, such as vehicles, pedestrians, roads,
    parking lots, and city infrastructure, allowing the entities to communicate by
    sending messages over open channels. The message contains information flown regarding
    the road conditions or the drivers’ travel information. It might include some
    private details of the driver or the passenger, such as identity or biometrics,
    which might question privacy. Each node uses the information from neighboring
    nodes to provide services related to traffic management, road conditions, lost
    and found vehicle locating, speed control, etc.

  zh: 因此，普通交通已经经历了一场激烈的创新，并转变为称为物联网车辆（IoV）的智能交通框架。 IoV是一个由不同实体组成的网络，如车辆、行人、道路、停车场和城市基础设施，允许这些实体通过开放通道发送消息进行通信。
    消息包含有关道路条件或驾驶员行程信息的信息。 它可能包含驾驶员或乘客的一些私人细节，如身份或生物特征，这可能涉及隐私。 每个节点都使用相邻节点的信息来提供与交通管理、道路条件、寻找丢失和找到的车辆、速度控制等相关的服务。

    IoV-enabled smart transportation is combined with HWSN (Heterogeneous Wireless
    Sensor Network) technology to assist vehicles in performing data compilation and
    transferring information easily and seamlessly. IoV uses 802.11p protocol and
    DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications) [[1](#CR1)] to support enhanced communication
    and handoff schemes, making the network highly secured and providing end-to-end

    the data center for traffic analysis. Vehicles can even fetch information from
    the data center via *RSU* to take traffic-related decisions. Wrong information
    might lead to loss of life, time, and economy. Therefore, the authenticity of
    vehicles and *RSU*s is important to ensure the correctness of the information

- en: Many authentication Schemes [[3](#CR3)–[9](#CR9)] have been suggested to ensure
    privacy, integrity, unlinkability, along with secure communication in an open
    channel. But the schemes face many issues, like central registration authority,
    privacy issues, long certificate mechanism, fabricated hardware problems, excess
    storage overheads, and large computation and communication costs. These issues
    make the applications of such schemes in real-time smart transportation difficult
    and impossible as they may lead to errors, consequences, and threats. For this
    reason, various blockchain-based solutions are provided recently which mitigate
    all the issues faced by traditional authentication mechanism and makes it efficient
    for smart transportation. This chapter focuses on efficient blockchain-based authentication
    protocols and has less computation and communication costs with extra security
    and functionality features.

    这些问题使得这些方案在实时智能交通中的应用困难和不可能，因为它们可能导致错误，后果和威胁。 因此，最近提供了各种基于区块链的解决方案，这些解决方案可以缓解传统身份验证机制面临的所有问题，并使其对智能交通更加有效。

    authority (*TA*), which is fully trusted and is used to register vehicles and
    *RSUs*. Some architectures might also deploy many *TAs* to decrease the latency
    and load of one TA. With multi *TA* architecture, a cross *TA* authentication
    problem occurs, when a vehicle goes from one *TA* zone to another [[10](#CR10)].
    *RSU* and *TA* generally have dedicated connections that are secured. Still, the

    However, various vulnerabilities need strong consideration while designing the
    security schemes. The communications among these entities (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians,
    fleet management systems, and roadside infrastructure) occur via open channels.
    The adversary can target an insecure communication to eavesdrop, modify, insert
    fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete data in transit, resulting in replay,
    impersonation, man-in-the-middle, or privileged-insider attacks, among others.
    Therefore, strong security solutions or authentication protocols are required
    that fulfill the security and functionality aspects. It is also important for
    the security solution to be cost-effective and time-efficient. Recently, blockchain
    technology has come out as a flying color to provide security solutions in managing
    smart transportation. Blockchain technology is decentralized, immutable, and transparent,
    making it appropriate to use as a security solution. In this chapter, we mainly
    focus on blockchain-based security protocols for smart transportation. The main
    objective of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction to the latest blockchain
    technology and its implementation to provide security solutions for smart transportation.

    do not trust each other and communicate over an open channel. The lack of trust
    and open communication forms an insecure channel, making it easy and approachable
    for an adversary to launch various security attacks. Not only this, but in a real-time
    application like IoV, an attacker can even trace the users’ messages and identities,
    and might hamper the privacy of the customers and drivers, which can be life-threatening.
    Therefore, blockchain-based solutions are one of the most optimal approaches to
    providing security in an IoV-enabled smart transport system. It also maintains

    nodes in the network. The blocks are added one after the other in a chain such
    that each block is linked to the previous block’s hash value. The root block in
    the blockchain is known as the genesis block. Every blockchain block consists
    of a version of the block, the previous block’s hash value, timestamp value, a
    random nonce value, and number of transactions within the block. After the block
    is formed, every node validates the block and the validated block is added to
    the blockchain and is linked to the previous block by the parent hash value. Therefore,
    any block added in the chain is impossible to tamper with, and no block can be
    added between two already added blocks. This way, the records stored in the block

    Therefore, a mechanism is followed to validate the information and add the transactions
    to the block and the blockchain. The mechanism is called a *consensus mechanism*
    [[21](#CR21)]. Consensus means a process to agree with a decentralized or distributed
    network platform where the nodes cannot trust each other. A consensus mechanism
    is a procedure like a state machine running on every node in the network so that
    every individual concludes on the same output. A consensus mechanism is an algorithm
    that helps the miners validate a transaction and decide to add or drop a block
    in the blockchain. It ensures a tamper-free environment where one version of the
    truth should be agreed upon. It solves the problem of trust in blockchain, as
    all the non-trusted miners participating in the process undergo a similar algorithm
    to agree on the block’s validity. The consensus algorithm also mitigates the effect
    of the presence of faulty nodes in the network. All the nodes must reach an agreement
    about the state of the blockchain.

    bottleneck problems that could occur in one *TA* architecture. With multi *TA*
    architecture, cross *TA* authentication problem occurs when a vehicle goes from
    one *TA* zone to another. To support the decentralized nature of IoV and solve
    the above problems, Xu et al. proposed a blockchain-based roadside unit-assisted
    authentication and key agreement protocol for Internet of Vehicles [[10](#CR10)].
    Vehicle nodes (VNs) are equipped with onboard units (OBUs) which communicate with
    *RSU*s over open channel. System administrator initializes the system parameters
    used to register VNs before their deployment. VNs register themselves to their
    nearest TA. The registration information about VNs is stored in data center (DC).
    DC broadcasts the pointer/ block identifier and other information to TAs. TAs
    are the miners to construct private blockchain containing information about registration
    and encrypted traffic-related data. All TAs store the pointers to vehicle information
    in a block linked to the previous block and add a blockchain or distributed ledger
    based on the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism [[30](#CR30), [31](#CR31)]. During
    the authentication phase, VN sends an authentication request to *RSU* in its communication
    range. *RSU* forwards the request message to TA. *TA* checks for the presence
    of pointer to the vehicle in its blockchain and sends the authentication parameters
    of VN retrieved from DC to *RSU*. *RSU* authenticates *TA* and VN and sends the
    updated parameters to *TA* and VN. Next, *TA* authenticates *RSU* and vehicles
    authenticate *TA* simultaneously. *TA* updates the data center and sends an acknowledgment
    signal to *RSU*. Finally, both *TA* and VN agree on a session key for future communication.
    The scheme preserves anonymity and untraceability and is resistant to eavesdropping,
    impersonation, and replay attacks. The proposed scheme is efficient, as *RSU*s
    assist *TAs* during authentication to avoid bottleneck problems, also TAs maintain
    a common distributed ledger to store data to diminish cross-domain authentication
    problems.

- en: Tan and Chung [[77](#CR77)] proposed a mutual authentication and group key management
    scheme under cloud computing and edge computing layers for *RSU*s. The scheme
    does not use certificates; instead, it implements cloud-assisted infrastructure
    that improves the overall efficiency. The architecture of this certificate-less
    scheme is designed in three layers. *TA* a fully trusted entity and resides in
    the cloud layer of the architecture. It registers *RSU* and vehicles via offline
    registration and assigns them a unique identity and partial secret. Following
    this is the edge layer that contains *RSUs* dedicated to forming edge clusters
    for decentralization. Finally, the lowest layer is the user layer that contains
    the vehicles. Following this, *RSU* and vehicle compute a temporary session ID
    using the assigned unique ID and timestamp values. RSU and vehicles use the temporary
    session ID to communicate in the future. To initiate communication, *RSU* issues
    a public certificate. The cloud server acts as a database that saves all important
    information related to vehicles and *RSU*. Vehicles verify the *RSU*’s certificate
    and compute its signature to form a request. A batch verification is performed
    on the received signatures by *RSU*. Cloud servers perform the second step of
    verification. To upgrade the efficient communication, a group of vehicles (V2V)
    independently establish a group key via consortium blockchain and Chinese remainder
    theorem (CRT) between them and the nearest *RSU* an allocated channel.

- en: Another blockchain-based solution for smart transportation system scheme proposed
    by [[33](#CR33)] is a blockchain-based batch authentication protocol for IoV deployment
    (BBAS-IoV). The system model consists of TA, vehicles, *RSU*, fog servers, and
    cloud servers. Initially, the *TA* sets up the system parameters and registers
    vehicles and *RSU*s before their deployment. Before initiating the communication,
    the scheme performs a signing and two independent authentication phases, one between
    vehicles (V2V), and other between vehicles and *RSU*. In the signing phase, a
    vehicle broadcasts a hello message and signature to fellow vehicles and the nearest
    *RSU*. In V2V authentication, the hello message and the signature of the sender
    vehicle are verified by other vehicles of the same cluster. And finally, *RSU*
    authenticates the signatures of all the vehicles in the cluster in a batch to
    increase efficiency. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles
    and *RSU* in their cluster for future communications. After successful authentication,
    *RSU* starts receiving and collecting traffic-related information from its vehicles
    securely and forms several transactions. The fog server partially forms the transactions
    and then forwarded to the blockchain center containing cloud servers. A Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) [[26](#CR26)] consensus algorithm is employed
    for block verification and addition in the blockchain. IoV produces huge data
    every day, so big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning
    (ML) are also implemented to add security.

    increased the probability of accidents on roads leading to fatal injuries to drivers
    and passengers and even deaths. In 2020, Vangala et al. designed an authentication
    scheme called blockchain-enabled certificate-based authentication for vehicle
    accident detection and notification in ITS environment (BCAS-VADN) [[34](#CR34)].
    The system model consists of a trusted registration authority (RA), vehicles flying
    in clusters, *RSUs*, edge servers, and a blockchain center containing cloud servers.
    RA sets up the system parameters and enrolls all the vehicles, *RSUs*, edge servers,
    and cloud servers and loads the credentials in their storage. Next, mutual authentication
    and key establishment phase occur between vehicle and their corresponding cluster
    head (CH) and between CH and *RSU*. The key established during the authentication
    phase ensures secure future communication. Vehicles are pre-installed with sensors
    that are capable of detecting accidents. On the occurrence of an accident, a message
    containing notification including the details of the accident like time, place,
    location, the ID of the vehicle in accident, ID of sender vehicle, level of accident,
    severity of the passengers, and its cause are signed and sent to the *RSU* via
    cluster head using the established session key. *RSUs* forward the verified details
    and transactions to the edge servers. Edge servers in the edge computing layer
    form the partial block and forward to the cloud servers present in the blockchain
    center. Cloud servers complete the block and form a peer-to-peer network to run
    the consensus algorithm to verify and add the block to the blockchain.

    authenticated vehicle. It also maintains the data set to store the pseudo-identity
    with its corresponding real identity to track malicious vehicle computing hash
    value. A hash of pseudo-identity and the public key is also sent to the cloud
    server, which is used to verify the legality of vehicles in the future. *RSUs*
    form a peer-to-peer network to implement a consensus algorithm to form a blockchain.
    To begin with, the communication, when a vehicle comes in a range of *RSU* it
    sends an authentication request using its pseudo-identity. *RSU* checks the authenticity
    of the vehicle by verifying the request from the cloud server. The cloud server
    manages the pseudonyms issued by CA and saves traffic updates and messages flown
    by the vehicles in its database. To accomplish secure communication in the future,
    an integer negotiation process is implemented between *RSU* and a vehicle. A random
    number chosen by *RSU* is encrypted using vehicle’s public key is sent to the
    vehicle. To confirm if the correct random number is received by the vehicle, a
    vehicle chooses another number, calculates a hash, and sends it to *RSU* along
    with its signature. The encrypted random number is decrypted by vehicle and used
    to send traffic updates and during future communication. Finally, when *RSU* hears
    any message update from vehicle, it forms a block containing the transaction,
    including pseudo-identity, the public key of the vehicle, traffic announcements
    by vehicles, hash value of the event transaction, and timestamp. The announced
    traffic update is notified to other vehicles by *RSU*. The vehicles make timely
    decisions after verifying the transaction details from the cloud server.

- en: Lin et al. [[79](#CR79)] proposed a blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving
    authentication (BCPPA) protocol. During the system initialization phase, a key
    derivation algorithm is invoked to mitigate the risk and enhance security. According
    to the algorithm, a vehicle chooses a private root key and a chain code that derives
    a fresh private key for every communication. The corresponding root public key
    and chain code is sent to certificate authorities (CA), which can be used to generate
    certificates for every communication (corresponding to the private key derived).
    Although the scheme is based on a public key infrastructure model, it still incurs
    less storage cost as the public key certificates are not transmitted but are pre-recorded
    in the blockchain by CA. CA embeds certificates into a transaction using Ethereum
    (a public blockchain) and maps them to transactions using smart contracts. To
    send a traffic update to other vehicles, a vehicle first retrieves the transaction
    id of its certificate. Finally, a signing algorithm is triggered through which
    the sender vehicle signs the message, timestamp, and transaction id using the
    derived private key. Next, the receiving vehicle verifies the message by running
    a message verification algorithm. It fetches the certificate from the blockchain
    corresponding to the transaction id received in the message. The justified verification
    of the message signature via public key ensures the message’s validity and authenticity
    of the sender vehicle (Table [1](#Tab1)).Table 1

    and its types. Further, we described various consensus algorithms that can be
    implemented in smart transportation. We also listed some advantages of blockchain
    implementation in smart transportation. Next, we outlined security aspects, privacy
    issues along with several attacks and threats on smart transportation. Later in
    this chapter, a detailed description of recent schemes that have provided security
    solutions for blockchain-based smart transportation systems is provided. We compared
    the performance of the schemes based on their computational cost, communication
    cost, and other security functionality features. Few schemes have high computation
    and communication costs because of heavy cryptographic operations and huge message
    content, while others have average or low computation and communication costs.
    The schemes are also analyzed on various features, like privacy preservation,
    integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, traceability or unlinkability, cross
    *TA* authentication and key agreement, replay, man-in-the-middle, and impersonation
    attacks.
