    my luggage to the curb outside the Aria hotel. The porter came along behind me,
    wheeling our trade show display.

    of coconut air freshener. The seat was missing springs. A TV screen blared noise
    at you. You watched the meter tick upward, like a time bomb in reverse, worrying
    that the driver was deliberately taking you the long way.
