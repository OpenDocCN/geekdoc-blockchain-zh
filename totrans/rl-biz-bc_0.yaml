- en: January 3, 2019, marked the tenth anniversary of the first blockchain transaction.
    Within days of that inaugural transaction, we started having conversations with
    business executives about the potential of blockchain to create digital opportunities.
    Those conversations number by now in the thousands. We have also heard hundreds
    of technology providers promote their view of the technology. Those interactions
    made clear to us that senior executives like you face difficult choices.

- en: Those among you who are just starting to explore blockchain may feel that the
    technology is so specialized and complex that it belongs in the domain of technology
    specialists. You might struggle to see how it is relevant to you and your business
    function, and thus see little incentive to move from a position of observation
    to one of experimentation. Others among you may be blockchain veterans, sold years
    ago on the technology and its promise for bringing about world peace and abolishing
    hunger. You may feel disappointed that, ten years later, those promises have not
    been realized.

    that blockchain’s promise of providing a way to do business with anyone or anything
    in the world at any transaction size and without an intermediary between you is
    as powerful as ever. The question is not if the technology will deliver, but when,
    and what role do you play in making sure its promise is realized? Furthermore,
    business leaders like you must ask yourselves whether you’re ready to accept and
    adopt the changes that blockchain will require of your organization. And are these
    changes worth the returns?

- en: The answers to these questions are far easier to come by with accurate, ground-level,
    unbiased, and business-oriented information on what blockchain is and what makes
    it powerful. You need to understand where it can accelerate your digital transformation,
    how it interacts with other technology platforms in your enterprise, and how it
    could affect organizational and societal constructs. You need a reliable road
    map for tracking the evolution of blockchain and planning how you can capitalize
    on it.

- en: We wrote this book to provide you with that information, along with the insight
    you need to capitalize on this world-changing technology. We define blockchain
    in the clearest business terms possible and describe what it enables you to do
    that is not possible today. From that foundation, we give you the strategic tools,
    vision, and confidence you’ll need to make sound and timely decisions for yourself
    and your organization.

- en: These decisions will reverberate outside the walls of your business, since blockchain,
    by definition, is not contained within an enterprise or ecosystem. How you apply
    the technology has implications for society and the future role of technology
    in the human experience, in the expansion of financial enfranchisement, and on
    issues of trust, identity, privacy, value, and democratization.

    them as they cut through the hype and focus on the core value propositions that
    blockchain may unlock, and what it will take to succeed.
