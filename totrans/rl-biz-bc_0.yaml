  zh: 前言
- en: January 3, 2019, marked the tenth anniversary of the first blockchain transaction.
    Within days of that inaugural transaction, we started having conversations with
    business executives about the potential of blockchain to create digital opportunities.
    Those conversations number by now in the thousands. We have also heard hundreds
    of technology providers promote their view of the technology. Those interactions
    made clear to us that senior executives like you face difficult choices.

  zh: 2019年1月3日标志着第一个区块链交易的十周年。在那次开创性交易几天内，我们就开始与企业高管讨论区块链创造数字机遇的潜力。到目前为止，这些对话已经数以千计。我们还听到数百家技术提供商推广他们对该技术的看法。这些互动让我们清楚地认识到，像你们这样的高级主管面临着艰难的选择。
- en: Those among you who are just starting to explore blockchain may feel that the
    technology is so specialized and complex that it belongs in the domain of technology
    specialists. You might struggle to see how it is relevant to you and your business
    function, and thus see little incentive to move from a position of observation
    to one of experimentation. Others among you may be blockchain veterans, sold years
    ago on the technology and its promise for bringing about world peace and abolishing
    hunger. You may feel disappointed that, ten years later, those promises have not
    been realized.

  zh: 对于你们中刚开始探索区块链的人来说，也许会觉得这项技术非常专业和复杂，似乎只属于技术专家的领域。你们可能会很难理解它与你们及你们的业务职能有何关联，因此从观察者的位置转变为实践者可能会感到缺乏动力。而你们中的其他人可能是区块链的老手，数年前就对这项技术及其为实现世界和平和消除饥饿的承诺深信不疑。十年后，你们可能感到失望，因为这些承诺尚未实现。
- en: Whatever your level of experience with this disruptive technology, understand
    that blockchain’s promise of providing a way to do business with anyone or anything
    in the world at any transaction size and without an intermediary between you is
    as powerful as ever. The question is not if the technology will deliver, but when,
    and what role do you play in making sure its promise is realized? Furthermore,
    business leaders like you must ask yourselves whether you’re ready to accept and
    adopt the changes that blockchain will require of your organization. And are these
    changes worth the returns?

  zh: 无论你对这项颠覆性技术有多少经验，都要明白区块链承诺的提供一种与世界上任何人或任何事物进行业务往来的方式，在任何交易规模下都不需要中介的承诺仍然一样强大。问题不在于技术是否会实现，而在于何时实现，以及你在确保其承诺实现中扮演的角色是什么？此外，像你这样的商业领导者必须问自己，你们是否准备好接受并采纳区块链将要求你们组织作出的变革？而这些变革是否值得投入？
- en: The answers to these questions are far easier to come by with accurate, ground-level,
    unbiased, and business-oriented information on what blockchain is and what makes
    it powerful. You need to understand where it can accelerate your digital transformation,
    how it interacts with other technology platforms in your enterprise, and how it
    could affect organizational and societal constructs. You need a reliable road
    map for tracking the evolution of blockchain and planning how you can capitalize
    on it.

  zh: 这些问题的答案在于获得准确、基础、无偏见且以业务为导向的关于区块链是什么以及它为何强大的信息。您需要了解它如何加速您的数字转型，它与企业中其他技术平台的交互方式，以及它可能如何影响组织和社会结构。您需要一个可靠的路线图来跟踪区块链的演进，并计划如何从中获利。
- en: We wrote this book to provide you with that information, along with the insight
    you need to capitalize on this world-changing technology. We define blockchain
    in the clearest business terms possible and describe what it enables you to do
    that is not possible today. From that foundation, we give you the strategic tools,
    vision, and confidence you’ll need to make sound and timely decisions for yourself
    and your organization.

  zh: 我们撰写这本书是为了向您提供这些信息，以及您需要利用这种改变世界的技术的洞察力。我们以最清晰的商业术语定义了区块链，并描述了它使您能够做到今天不可能做到的事情。基于这个基础，我们为您提供了您和您的组织所需的战略工具、愿景和信心，以便做出明智和及时的决策。
- en: These decisions will reverberate outside the walls of your business, since blockchain,
    by definition, is not contained within an enterprise or ecosystem. How you apply
    the technology has implications for society and the future role of technology
    in the human experience, in the expansion of financial enfranchisement, and on
    issues of trust, identity, privacy, value, and democratization.

  zh: 这些决策将产生业务墙外的影响，因为根据定义，区块链并不局限于一个企业或生态系统之内。您如何应用这项技术对社会以及技术在人类经验中的未来角色、金融赋权的扩展、以及信任、身份、隐私、价值和民主化等问题都有着深远的影响。
- en: In short, we wrote this book for business executives and policy makers to assist
    them as they cut through the hype and focus on the core value propositions that
    blockchain may unlock, and what it will take to succeed.
