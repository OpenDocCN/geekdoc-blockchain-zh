  zh: 14.1.1 概述
- en: The twenty-first century has witnessed unprecedented advancements in computer
    science, especially in the field of AI, leading to the emergence of many innovative
    technologies with a profound impact on all aspects of human endeavor, including
    law, the provision of financial services, insurance, health, automobile industry,
    and others. For years, one of the central concerns of AI as it relates to law
    in practice has been the means of creating, evolving, and expanding automated
    and computer-based algorithmic modes of legal argument (Prakken, [2008](#CR29)).
    Generally, the rise and large-scale adoption of AI is changing the methodology
    in different fields of the legal profession, for instance, in the administration
    of justice and the provision of legal service, and has effectively spearheaded
    and introduced the concept of legal automation—that is, the substitutive or complementary
    use of AI-powered computer technology to perform legal tasks which hitherto required
    human intelligence. AI in conjunction with law also has implications for fields
    beyond computer science and law, mainly fields with law-like structures and norms,
    with relevant impact in society, such a psychology and philosophy (Rissland et
    al., [2003](#CR30)). While the effect of AI adoption in law, either as disruptive
    or complementary, remains debatable, it has undoubtedly improved efficiency and
    saved cost and time in the administration of not only justice and law practice,
    as will be discussed in this chapter, but also in core fields relevant to the
    societal development.

  zh: 21世纪见证了计算机科学领域的前所未有的进步，特别是在人工智能领域，导致许多创新技术的出现，对人类努力的各个方面产生了深远影响，包括法律、金融服务、保险、健康、汽车工业等。多年来，人工智能与法律实践相关的核心问题之一是创造、发展和扩展自动化和基于计算机的法律论证算法模式的方法（Prakken，[2008](#CR29)）。总的来说，人工智能的兴起和大规模应用正在改变法律职业不同领域的方法论，例如司法管理和法律服务的提供，并有效地推动和引入了法律自动化的概念——即利用人工智能驱动的计算机技术来执行以前需要人类智能的法律任务的替代或补充。人工智能与法律的结合也对计算机科学和法律以外的领域产生影响，主要是具有类似法律结构和规范的领域，在心理学和哲学等领域有相关影响（Rissland等，[2003](#CR30)）。尽管人工智能在法律领域的应用效果，无论是作为破坏性还是补充性，仍然存在争议，但它无疑提高了不仅仅是司法和法律实践的效率并节省了成本和时间，正如本章将讨论的那样，还提高了对社会发展相关核心领域的管理效率。
- en: The study of AI over time has revealed this concept to be an exciting contribution,
    not only to the world of technology as we know it, but also to other areas of
    human endeavors including, but not limited to, legal practice, the administration
    of justice, financial services, insurance, health, etc. The major preoccupation
    of this paper is to examine how the adoption of AI has changed and may change
    the business of law practice in the world generally and in Nigeria in particular.
    With Nigeria being seemingly conservative and somewhat slower in embracing certain technological
    advancements, it may seem that the developments brought about by AI are too remote
    and distant from being currently utilized in Nigeria. However, such a narrow viewpoint
    limits the creativity, innovation, and subtle ingenuity associated with AI, especially
    from a legal standpoint. Further so, lawyers have always been known as jacks of
    all trades, so there is no doubt that the legal profession is capable of embracing
    AI and the associated evolutions that are already changing the legal landscape
    across the globe.

    the impact of technological advancements has been relatively minimal (Hu & Lu,
    [2019](#CR17)). However, AI has begun to change this pattern, and a key course
    of movement in this direction was the initiation of the International Conference
    on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL) in 1987 which served as a medium for
    publishing and the development of ideas within the field of AI and law (Srivastava,
    [2018](#CR33)). A few years after the ICAIL came the formation of the International
    Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law (IAAIL), with the mandate to promote
    the study and development of artificial intelligence in legal practice (Hu & Lu,
    [2019](#CR17)). These establishments appear to have set a precedent for the foundation
    of several other mediums through which more research was encouraged, and further
    light was shed on the relationship between AI and law, such as the annual Jurix
    conferences held by the Jurix Foundation for Legal Technology-Based Systems (Leenes
    & Svenson, [1995](#CR22)) in Europe in the late 1980s. The A*rtificial Intelligence

    & Lu，[2019](#CR17)）。这些机构似乎为成立其他多种研究促进平台设立了先例，进一步探讨了人工智能与法律之间的关系，例如欧洲于1980年代后期由法律技术基础系统Jurix基金会举办的年度Jurix会议（Leenes
    & Svenson，[1995](#CR22)）。《人工智能与法律杂志》首次出版于1992年。

    materialization of AI in both substantive and administrative functions became
    popularized, primarily through the use of online legal services as an alternative
    or an assist to everyday legal services provided by legal professionals, as well
    as cloud computing, which fuses the machine learning capacity of AI with cloud
    computing technology to create the most proficient storage systems possible (EZMarketing,
    [2020](#CR10)). For instance, the phenomenon of AI or “robot” lawyers with the
    ability to communicate in human language being “employed” has intrigued both clients

    only in the substantive nature of legal work that is currently carried out by
    lawyers in practice but eventually on the prospect of legal careers. As a case
    in point, the Deloitte Insights report (Haggerty) predicts numerous changes and
    developments throughout the law practice within the decade, with technologically
    influenced changes allowing for an estimated 39% of jobs in the legal profession
    transitioning to automated roles in the United Kingdom (Hill, [2016](#CR16)).

- en: While the feedback  from lawyers in the United States seemingly adopts a lethargic
    approach to some aspects of AI, such as cloud computing, American lawyers nevertheless
    acknowledge the growing relevance of AI in their profession. For instance, almost
    30% of lawyers indicated that cloud services provide the benefit of greater security
    for legal documents, processes, etc. that they are otherwise unable to provide
    without the use of the cloud services (Hill, [2016](#CR16)). Experts have also
    predicted that companies will increase their spending on AI from about $8 billion
    in 2016 to an estimated $47 billion by the end of 2020, yielding almost a 600%
    increase over the last 4 years (Miller). In essence, whether or not lawyers express
    an interest or discover a need to utilize cloud computing, the estimate is that
    their client base will invest in AI, which in itself is likely to then result
    in a butterfly effect on those lawyers they rely on for legal services.

    that AI certainly has a massive potential to develop the conditions and mechanisms
    within which lawyers provide legal services in Nigeria, which would not only improve
    cost efficiency and time spent but also reduce costs for the law firms and the
    clients. LawPavilion, an online repertoire of electronic law reports developed

    the fears that AI will eliminate the jobs of lawyers, due to the emotional, complex,

    involve an almost infinite range of AI variations as to how these individuals
    in the judiciary would eventually arrive at certain decisions (Tarufo, [1998](#CR35)).
    This presents the issue of which theoretical approach would be likely to produce
    the most favorable approximation or suggestion through which a decision can be
    made for the administration of justice (Tarufo, [1998](#CR35)). This is because
    decision-making methodologies and algorithms use different sets of data and a
    variety of sensory inputs that are also evolving with time (Whitney, [2019](#CR38)).

  zh: 14.3.1 人工智能
- en: AI was initially rooted in the idea that humans can develop computer programs
    to imitate their behavior and intelligence. Therefore, the usefulness of AI is
    based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a manner that
    can be mimicked and replicated to make intelligent machines that will have the
    ability to perform tasks that used to be the exclusive preserve of humans. Technically,
    AI can be described as the process of simulating or mimicking human thought patterns,
    processes, and intelligent conclusions through electronic or mechanical means,
    particularly using computers or advanced computer programs (Rouse, [2020](#CR48)).
    These crucial aspects of AI are the ability of the machines or programs to learn
    (accepting input of information and comprehending the canons and regulations around
    same), apply reason (using the accepted regulations to determine approximated
    or certain judgments), and detect wrong and correct itself (Rouse, [2020](#CR48)).

  zh: 人工智能最初根植于一个观念，即人类可以开发计算机程序来模仿他们的行为和智能。因此，人工智能的实用性基于这样一个原则：人类智能可以被定义为可以被模仿和复制的方式，从而制造出能够执行曾经只有人类才能完成的任务的智能机器。从技术上讲，人工智能可以被描述为通过电子或机械手段，特别是使用计算机或先进的计算机程序，模拟或仿真人类的思维模式、过程和智能结论的过程（Rouse，[2020](#CR48)）。人工智能的关键方面包括机器或程序具有学习的能力（接受信息输入并理解相关规范和法规）、应用推理（利用已接受的规则来确定近似或确定的判断）、以及发现错误并自我纠正（Rouse，[2020](#CR48)）。
- en: It is important to note that AI is a seemingly endless set of technologies,
    codes, and programs, not a monolith, and can also be seen as several streams that
    include, but are not limited to, “machine learning, natural language processing,
    expert systems, vision, speech, planning and robotics” (Kemp, [2018](#CR46)).
    Machine learning (ML) and expert systems are arguably the most applicable to law.
    ML systems can simulate human cognitive ability—i.e., learning and improving from
    experience—and can perform tasks without being expressly trained to do so. As
    a subfield of AI (Cioffi et al., [2020](#CR45)), the development of ML systems
    owes much of their success to the availability of huge data, a phenomenon commonly
    known as “big data.” ML is likely to be used for the development of complex legal
    AI, such as AI lawyers or judges, which need to be able to learn from the data
    they receive in order to make cognitive and applicable decisions on a case-by-case
    basis.

- en: Expert systems, on the other hand, are designed to analyze and crack difficult
    issues on their own volition through volumes of gathered expertise, represented
    mainly as “if-then” conditional statements (put simply, “if this happens, then
    that will happen”) rather than through standard or traditionally accepted codes
    (Verma, [2019](#CR49)). Thus, while ML systems can think and learn from experience,
    expert systems are rule-based—literally speaking, they cannot think and/or act
    beyond the expert knowledge injected in them. Expert systems would be used in
    different manners than AI, perhaps through smart contracts. For example, closing
    a financial transaction usually involves satisfying what is commonly known as
    ‘conditions precedent’. A condition precedent could be, for instance, the seller
    of a piece of land discharging all existing encumbrances over the land prior to
    the sale to the buyer. The role of the seller’s lawyer here is to ensure that
    all legal documentation necessary to discharge the existing encumbrances are properly
    drafted and executed by the seller, while the buyer’s lawyer would review the
    documentation before confirming to the buyer that the condition has been satisfied.
    Expert systems could automate this entire process through programs that can do
    all the analysis automatedly and even execute through stored electronic signatures
    of the parties (e.g., the program code would be tailored towards something along
    the lines of “if all conditions are satisfied, then execute the contract and append
    electronic signatures”) or other similar applications.

    in its infancy, and while AI may be a fledgling technology in Nigeria, its future
    certainly looks more promising than in recent years (Okunola, [2018](#CR27)).
    The rapid adoption of AI innovations in developed jurisdictions, coupled with
    the impediments and inefficiency resulting from over-reliance on analogue law
    practice, clients’ pressure (especially foreign clients) and interaction with
    international law firms, is stimulating some law firms in Nigeria to begin considering
    and gradually adopt AI technology to advance their legal practice.

    law report developed in Nigeria, which enables lawyers to access the rich depth
    of decided cases in Nigeria. LawPavilion has recently expanded its repertoire
    by adding a new toolkit, known as the “Solicitors and Arbitrators’ Toolkit (SAT)  ,”
    which provides comprehensive arbitration resources in the form of precedents,
    laws, regulations, standard templates/agreements, and much more. Other electronic
    law reports in Nigeria are Legalpedia, the online version of the Nigerian Weekly
    Law Reports, and the All Federation Weekly Law Reports. AI certainly has a massive
    potential to develop the conditions and mechanisms within which lawyers provide
    legal services in Nigeria and will, in the long run, improve competitiveness in
    the legal market. The adoption of Technology-Assisted Review (TAR)  and other
    online legal services that have been engineered to perform routine tasks performed
    by lawyers will enable them to concentrate on more complex substantive issues,
    and clients are also able to explore new and more cost-effective ways to arrive
    at solutions to their problems.

    in Nigeria. On the one hand, the mere existence of intelligent tools that can
    automatically formulate sentences, set bail conditions, and determine the likelihood
    of repeat offense would do wonders for our criminal justice system. Not only would
    it lead to a de-congestion of the courtrooms from the arduous processes of criminal
    litigation, but it could also result in many prisoners being freed as well, given
    that the bail process would be made smoother. Theoretically, it is possible that
    the AI system (in tandem with a database of all prisoners) would be able to detect
    persons that have been imprisoned without being charged to court within the timelines
    required by law and automatically submit a request to the prison or station holding
    such person for their immediate release.

    feed in a sentencing AI program with more localized biases, such as ethnic, religious,

    harsher sentences to persons of a particular ethnic, religious, or economic class
    while favoring others that are not in those classes? Systems of checks and balances

    robots with sentient legal programming installed. The AI counsel and judge would
    all have to be programmed to speak fluent English, given that the language of
    the courtroom is the English language. However, there are clients or witnesses
    that speak different local languages (such as Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, or many other
    Nigerian languages) or are mute; the AI would also have to be programmed in such
    a manner that it can adapt to these variations. The AI lawyer would, for instance,
    have to request for a translator for a witness that only speaks Yoruba, and the
    AI judge would have to understand the nature of the request and be able to call
    for a translator from among the legal staff present in the courtroom or adjourn
    the proceedings’ pending appointment of a translator. All of this would have to
    occur practically within just the first few minutes of a trial. This is just one
    small example of the many difficulties facing AI implementation in legal proceedings.

  zh: NextCounsel（或其他类似应用程序）可能面临类似的挑战。跟踪 Microsoft Word、Excel 等的“主动”与“被动”使用对于了解在客户工作上花费的时间和如何计费至关重要。因此，如果
    AI 系统出现错误，人工审查发票可能在某种程度上是不可避免的，这可能会给律师事务所带来严重的业务后果（即，想象一下因为 AI 错误而将客户对于两页文档的审查计费
    10 小时！）。
- en: Moving aside from specific programs and assessing AI generally in relation to
    the business of law practice, an exciting development that may occur is the fusion
    of law firms and technology companies to provide legal services. The reason for
    this is not hard to discern; in adopting AI in law practice, law firms typically
    have three options. The AI system could be developed internally by their IT departments;
    it could be outsourced to an external IT firm. Alternatively, law firms could
    merge with technology companies to save costs. The first two options are less
    appealing due to cost consideration, while the last two options may be the most
    preferred for law firms, especially small and midsize law firms. Unfortunately,
    the current regulatory restriction in Nigeria is not amenable to the adoption
    of the last option.

  zh: 离开特定程序，评估 AI 在法律实践业务中的普遍作用，一个可能发生的激动人心的发展是法律公司和技术公司融合提供法律服务。这样做的原因不难理解；在采用 AI
    进行法律实践时，律师事务所通常有三种选择。AI 系统可以由他们的 IT 部门内部开发；它可以外包给外部 IT 公司。或者，律师事务所可以与技术公司合并以节省成本。前两个选择由于成本考虑而不太吸引人，而后两个选择可能是律师事务所最偏爱的，特别是对于小型和中型律师事务所。不幸的是，尼日利亚目前的监管限制不利于采用最后一种选择。
- en: The Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC)  in Nigeria, which is binding on all
    Nigerian lawyers, requires a lawyer not to allow the professional services being
    provided by the said lawyer to be manipulated or domineered by any form of lay
    agency, whether personal or corporate, which would create interference between
    the lawyer and client^([7](#Fn7)) and partnership between a lawyer and a non-lawyer,
    is expressly prohibited.^([8](#Fn8)) These restrictions may affect or hinder on
    the manner and means with which lawyers interact or engage with AI. Regardless
    of these regulatory restrictions, the continued adoption of AI in Nigeria may
    usher in an indirect collaboration between law firms and technology companies
    in a manner that will not run counter to the provisions of the RPC. Alternatively,
    we may witness a future where AI lawyers are actually called to the bar! The exciting
    possibilities remain to be seen.

  zh: 尼日利亚的职业行为准则（RPC）对所有尼日利亚律师具有约束力，要求律师不得允许其提供的专业服务被任何形式的非专业机构（无论是个人还是公司）操纵或控制，这会在律师与客户之间产生干扰^([7](#Fn7))。此外，律师与非律师之间的合作伙伴关系明确受到禁止^([8](#Fn8))。这些限制可能影响或阻碍律师与人工智能互动或参与的方式和手段。尽管存在这些监管限制，但在尼日利亚继续采用人工智能可能会在不违反RPC规定的情况下引入律师事务所与技术公司之间的间接合作。或者，我们可能会见证未来人工智能律师真正被接纳到法庭的可能性！这些激动人心的可能性尚待观察。
- en: Lastly, as law firms continue to adopt AI tools, the required skillsets for
    employment will change as potential candidates may be expected to display proficiency
    in more basic-level technology, in addition to sourcing for open-minded employees
    willing to learn about new technological advancements. This may in turn necessitate
    a change in the curriculum of legal education in Nigeria to meet the demands of
    the labor market. Accordingly, future lawyers are likely to be law and tech-savvy.

  zh: 最后，随着律师事务所继续采用AI工具，就业所需的技能组合也将发生变化，潜在候选人可能需要展示更多基础级别技术的熟练掌握，同时寻找愿意学习新技术进展的开明员工。这可能会促使尼日利亚法律教育课程的改变，以满足劳动市场的需求。因此，未来的律师可能需要具备法律和技术敏感性。

  zh: 14.6.2 结论
- en: This chapter has delved into the emergence and potentials of AI both from a
    global perspective and in Nigeria. Hence, instead of regarding AI as a potential
    threat to jobs in the legal profession, it should be seen as complementary. Rather
    than the hyperbolic threats of a hostile takeover of the legal profession by super-intelligent
    robots, the effect of AI innovations over the coming years will probably be that
    of increased IT proficiency in lawyers at a fast pace. It is a trite legal maxim
    that “a good lawyer is not one that knows the law, but where to find it.” In that
    vein, the future good lawyer may not only be one that knows where to find the
    law but also knows how to use AI systems in the provision of legal services. Although
    AI is indisputably useful, as demonstrated in this chapter, there are limitations
    to what formulaic programs can do without the input of lawyers. Nonetheless, AI,
    and by extension legal automation, will continue to gain traction and attract
    more investments.

  zh: 本章已经深入探讨了人工智能的出现和潜力，既从全球的角度，也从尼日利亚的角度。因此，与其将人工智能视为法律职业潜在威胁，不如将其视为互补。与其说是超级智能机器对法律职业的敌对接管的夸张威胁，未来几年人工智能创新的影响可能是律师在IT熟练度上快速提高。有一句司空见惯的法律格言：“一个优秀的律师不是知道法律的人，而是知道在哪里找到法律的人。”在这方面，未来优秀的律师可能不仅是懂得在哪里找到法律的人，而且还懂得如何在提供法律服务时使用人工智能系统。尽管人工智能无疑是有用的，正如本章所示，但在没有律师的输入下，公式化程序所能做的事情是有限的。尽管如此，人工智能，以及法律自动化，将继续获得关注并吸引更多投资。
- en: The future of AI in Nigerian law practice may mirror the above predictions,
    albeit at a much slower pace due to existing fiscal and technological challenges.
    Regardless, law is a global practice, and the Nigerian lawyer of today must take
    an active interest in the development and use of AI innovations in the provision
    of legal services. As mentioned in this chapter, we foresee a radical change in
    the legal education curriculum in response to the future demands of the labor
    markets as per the skillsets lawyers would be expected to possess to be able to
    cope and meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

  zh: 尼日利亚法律实践中人工智能的未来可能会反映上述预测，尽管由于现有的财政和技术挑战，其步伐要慢得多。尽管如此，法律是一种全球性的实践，今天的尼日利亚律师必须对法律服务的提供中人工智能创新的发展和使用保持积极的兴趣。正如本章所述，我们预见法律教育课程将因应未来劳动力市场对律师所期望具备的技能集的需求而发生根本性变化，以便能够应对并满足21世纪的挑战。
- en: Thus, in the humble view of the authors, AI should be viewed as a way to thrust
    the Nigerian lawyer headfirst into the depths of the twenty-first century, rather
    than something to be feared due to job safety concerns. It will be interesting
    to see, in the coming years, more developing countries such as Nigeria expressing
    interest and participation in both research and practical applications of AI in
    legal practice.

  zh: 因此，在作者谦逊的观点中，人工智能应被视为将尼日利亚律师推进到二十一世纪深渊的一种方式，而不是因为对工作安全的担忧而感到恐惧。未来几年将会很有趣，我们会看到更多像尼日利亚这样的发展中国家对人工智能在法律实践中的研究和实际应用表现出兴趣和参与。
