- en: The twenty-first century has witnessed unprecedented advancements in computer
    science, especially in the field of AI, leading to the emergence of many innovative
    technologies with a profound impact on all aspects of human endeavor, including
    law, the provision of financial services, insurance, health, automobile industry,
    and others. For years, one of the central concerns of AI as it relates to law
    in practice has been the means of creating, evolving, and expanding automated
    and computer-based algorithmic modes of legal argument (Prakken, [2008](#CR29)).
    Generally, the rise and large-scale adoption of AI is changing the methodology
    in different fields of the legal profession, for instance, in the administration
    of justice and the provision of legal service, and has effectively spearheaded
    and introduced the concept of legal automation—that is, the substitutive or complementary
    use of AI-powered computer technology to perform legal tasks which hitherto required
    human intelligence. AI in conjunction with law also has implications for fields
    beyond computer science and law, mainly fields with law-like structures and norms,
    with relevant impact in society, such a psychology and philosophy (Rissland et
    al., [2003](#CR30)). While the effect of AI adoption in law, either as disruptive
    or complementary, remains debatable, it has undoubtedly improved efficiency and
    saved cost and time in the administration of not only justice and law practice,
    as will be discussed in this chapter, but also in core fields relevant to the
    societal development.

    not only to the world of technology as we know it, but also to other areas of
    human endeavors including, but not limited to, legal practice, the administration
    of justice, financial services, insurance, health, etc. The major preoccupation
    of this paper is to examine how the adoption of AI has changed and may change
    the business of law practice in the world generally and in Nigeria in particular.
    With Nigeria being seemingly conservative and somewhat slower in embracing certain technological
    advancements, it may seem that the developments brought about by AI are too remote
    and distant from being currently utilized in Nigeria. However, such a narrow viewpoint
    limits the creativity, innovation, and subtle ingenuity associated with AI, especially
    from a legal standpoint. Further so, lawyers have always been known as jacks of
    all trades, so there is no doubt that the legal profession is capable of embracing
    AI and the associated evolutions that are already changing the legal landscape
    across the globe.

    the impact of technological advancements has been relatively minimal (Hu & Lu,
    [2019](#CR17)). However, AI has begun to change this pattern, and a key course
    of movement in this direction was the initiation of the International Conference
    on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL) in 1987 which served as a medium for
    publishing and the development of ideas within the field of AI and law (Srivastava,
    [2018](#CR33)). A few years after the ICAIL came the formation of the International
    Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law (IAAIL), with the mandate to promote
    the study and development of artificial intelligence in legal practice (Hu & Lu,
    [2019](#CR17)). These establishments appear to have set a precedent for the foundation
    of several other mediums through which more research was encouraged, and further
    light was shed on the relationship between AI and law, such as the annual Jurix
    conferences held by the Jurix Foundation for Legal Technology-Based Systems (Leenes
    & Svenson, [1995](#CR22)) in Europe in the late 1980s. The A*rtificial Intelligence
    and Law Journal* was first published in 1992.

    research pioneered by these aforementioned institutions in earlier years. The
    materialization of AI in both substantive and administrative functions became
    popularized, primarily through the use of online legal services as an alternative
    or an assist to everyday legal services provided by legal professionals, as well
    as cloud computing, which fuses the machine learning capacity of AI with cloud
    computing technology to create the most proficient storage systems possible (EZMarketing,
    [2020](#CR10)). For instance, the phenomenon of AI or “robot” lawyers with the
    ability to communicate in human language being “employed” has intrigued both clients
    and law firms. More examples of these systems in practice will be explored later
    on in this chapter.

    only in the substantive nature of legal work that is currently carried out by
    lawyers in practice but eventually on the prospect of legal careers. As a case
    in point, the Deloitte Insights report (Haggerty) predicts numerous changes and
    developments throughout the law practice within the decade, with technologically
    influenced changes allowing for an estimated 39% of jobs in the legal profession
    transitioning to automated roles in the United Kingdom (Hill, [2016](#CR16)).
    Thus, what is to be expected is that AI systems can eventually replace manual
    legal work as we know it.

    approach to some aspects of AI, such as cloud computing, American lawyers nevertheless
    acknowledge the growing relevance of AI in their profession. For instance, almost
    30% of lawyers indicated that cloud services provide the benefit of greater security
    for legal documents, processes, etc. that they are otherwise unable to provide
    without the use of the cloud services (Hill, [2016](#CR16)). Experts have also
    predicted that companies will increase their spending on AI from about $8 billion
    in 2016 to an estimated $47 billion by the end of 2020, yielding almost a 600%
    increase over the last 4 years (Miller). In essence, whether or not lawyers express
    an interest or discover a need to utilize cloud computing, the estimate is that
    their client base will invest in AI, which in itself is likely to then result
    in a butterfly effect on those lawyers they rely on for legal services.

    to increase efficiency in legal practice. Supporting the foregoing reasoning,
    Miller S. theorizes that AI will become of indispensable assistance to legal professionals
    globally, to the extent that those who do not adapt to the new trends and dynamics
    will be left behind (Miller). However, this anticipated impact of AI on law practice
    appears to be in its preliminary stages, as research predicts that the substantive
    impact  will manifest in a few years.

    services and electronic forensics. This figure can be explained by the idea that
    such online legal services combined with customer cost pressure, i.e., corporate
    legal departments developing an increasing need for legal services at a lower
    cost, are compelling not just corporate legal departments but even law firms to

    of Nigerian literature on the role of AI on Nigerian legal practice, which mirrors
    the paucity in the usage of AI in legal practice in Nigeria currently. As has
    been mentioned, the majority of law practice and legal business in Nigeria is
    undertaken through physical and analog means, from court processes and appearances
    to invoicing, documentary review and execution, due diligence, etc. Corporate
    law firms in Nigeria have taken large strides in advancing the digitalization
    of these processes, but this has largely been limited to the more commercialized

    that AI certainly has a massive potential to develop the conditions and mechanisms
    within which lawyers provide legal services in Nigeria, which would not only improve
    cost efficiency and time spent but also reduce costs for the law firms and the
    clients. LawPavilion, an online repertoire of electronic law reports developed
    in Nigeria, is cited as one of the premier pieces of evidence as to how automated
    technology can be used even in developing countries like Nigeria staple of most
    commercial law firms. Bam & Gad Solicitors, however, note that because of the
    prevailing realities in Nigeria, they do not expect AI to rapidly take hold of
    the Nigerian legal landscape as quickly as one might think and discountenance
    the fears that AI will eliminate the jobs of lawyers, due to the emotional, complex,
    and special human interaction necessary to perform certain legal duties, such
    as client engagement and court appearances. They also believe there would be a
    large amount of public skepticism, particularly given the lack of adequate cybersecurity,
    digital rights laws, and updated technology laws (Bam and Gad Solicitors, [2019](#CR4)).

    of law in which we see the growing influence of AI, specifically as it relates
    to judicial decisions (Prakken, [2008](#CR29)). Given the complexity of decision-making
    in this regard and the efficiency and efficacy generally associated with the concept
    of AI, one’s mind can be drawn to the potential for AI to be utilized as a means
    to address or aid this process (Prakken, [2008](#CR29)). What first comes to mind
    here is the idea that the process of decision-making is such a complex one as
    it has always stood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, introducing concepts or systems that attempt to streamline this process
    can be especially difficult. For instance, through looking at various judicial
    systems, it is clear that the involvement of different individuals of contrasting
    backgrounds with varying thought processes arriving at a single decision would
    involve an almost infinite range of AI variations as to how these individuals
    in the judiciary would eventually arrive at certain decisions (Tarufo, [1998](#CR35)).
    This presents the issue of which theoretical approach would be likely to produce
    the most favorable approximation or suggestion through which a decision can be
    made for the administration of justice (Tarufo, [1998](#CR35)). This is because
    decision-making methodologies and algorithms use different sets of data and a
    variety of sensory inputs that are also evolving with time (Whitney, [2019](#CR38)).

    and predictions suggest that it will become more relevant over time (Sourdin,

    to determine whether the tendency of a convicted criminal to re-offend in criminal
    matters (as opposed to civil matters) and to assist in the process of sentencing
    convicted persons (Sourdin, [2018](#CR32)). Other such examples are discussed  in

    to imitate their behavior and intelligence. Therefore, the usefulness of AI is
    based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a manner that
    can be mimicked and replicated to make intelligent machines that will have the
    ability to perform tasks that used to be the exclusive preserve of humans. Technically,
    AI can be described as the process of simulating or mimicking human thought patterns,
    processes, and intelligent conclusions through electronic or mechanical means,
    particularly using computers or advanced computer programs (Rouse, [2020](#CR48)).
    These crucial aspects of AI are the ability of the machines or programs to learn
    (accepting input of information and comprehending the canons and regulations around
    same), apply reason (using the accepted regulations to determine approximated
    or certain judgments), and detect wrong and correct itself (Rouse, [2020](#CR48)).

    codes, and programs, not a monolith, and can also be seen as several streams that
    include, but are not limited to, “machine learning, natural language processing,
    expert systems, vision, speech, planning and robotics” (Kemp, [2018](#CR46)).
    Machine learning (ML) and expert systems are arguably the most applicable to law.
    ML systems can simulate human cognitive ability—i.e., learning and improving from
    experience—and can perform tasks without being expressly trained to do so. As
    a subfield of AI (Cioffi et al., [2020](#CR45)), the development of ML systems
    owes much of their success to the availability of huge data, a phenomenon commonly
    known as “big data.” ML is likely to be used for the development of complex legal
    AI, such as AI lawyers or judges, which need to be able to learn from the data
    they receive in order to make cognitive and applicable decisions on a case-by-case
    basis.

- en: Expert systems, on the other hand, are designed to analyze and crack difficult
    issues on their own volition through volumes of gathered expertise, represented
    mainly as “if-then” conditional statements (put simply, “if this happens, then
    that will happen”) rather than through standard or traditionally accepted codes
    (Verma, [2019](#CR49)). Thus, while ML systems can think and learn from experience,
    expert systems are rule-based—literally speaking, they cannot think and/or act
    beyond the expert knowledge injected in them. Expert systems would be used in
    different manners than AI, perhaps through smart contracts. For example, closing
    a financial transaction usually involves satisfying what is commonly known as
    ‘conditions precedent’. A condition precedent could be, for instance, the seller
    of a piece of land discharging all existing encumbrances over the land prior to
    the sale to the buyer. The role of the seller’s lawyer here is to ensure that
    all legal documentation necessary to discharge the existing encumbrances are properly
    drafted and executed by the seller, while the buyer’s lawyer would review the
    documentation before confirming to the buyer that the condition has been satisfied.
    Expert systems could automate this entire process through programs that can do
    all the analysis automatedly and even execute through stored electronic signatures
    of the parties (e.g., the program code would be tailored towards something along
    the lines of “if all conditions are satisfied, then execute the contract and append
    electronic signatures”) or other similar applications.

    tool in the criminal justice system to set bail conditions, prison sentences,
    and determine the likelihood of the defendants committing other offenses in the
    future. Some of the key AI tools that have been and are being used in this respect
    are COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)
    designed by Northpointe (Angwin et al., [2016](#CR44)) and HART (Harm Assessment
    Risk Tool) which was developed by a team of statisticians based at the University
    of Cambridge in tandem with Durham Constabulary (Oswald et al, [2018](#CR47)).

    how AI-powered software used in criminal sentencing, and predicting future criminals
    is biased against African Americans in the United States (Angwin et al., [2016](#CR44)).
    In fact, in a particular instance, an unsuccessful attempt was made to challenge
    the use of a Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanction
    (COMPAS)^([1](#Fn1)) software in the sentencing of Eric Loomis to 6 years in prison.
    The ground of the challenge was the use of the software in sentencing violated
    Loomis’s right to due process under the law, because such automated software rendered
    him unable to contest the socio-scientific accuracy and legal sustainability of
    such sentencing, especially within the context of certain social lenses such as
    race and gender.^([2](#Fn2))

    have further led to civil rights proceedings, in response to citizens challenging
    the accuracy of the AI system being used to decide their fate (Farvar, [2016](#CR11)).

    in contemporary law practice. The American Bar Association reported slight growth
    in the use of cloud computing by lawyers in 2019 relative to the survey results

    59% in 2019, with solo legal practitioners and small firms leading at the forefront
    (Kennedy, [2019](#CR20)). American lawyers have acknowledged the growing relevance
    of AI in their profession. For instance, almost 30% of lawyers indicated that
    cloud services provide the benefit of greater security for legal documents, processes,
    etc. that they are otherwise unable to provide without the use of the cloud services  (Kennedy,

    whether or not law firms express an interest or discover a need to utilize cloud

    increased workload and complexity of work, changing demographic of the workforce

    very efficient, it has its limitations. While an AI-powered software may efficiently
    sort numerous documents, the ultimate decision as to the actual relevance of the
    documents can only be made by lawyers conversant with the case at hand, as the
    software does not (yet) have that capability. Besides, the use of AI tools is
    limited to routine legal services as mentioned, and they may not be deployed to
    perform legal works that require human reasoning, such as the preparation of a
    legal opinion on a novel point of law or one that requires a lawyer to think outside
    the box which can only be truly achieved through the combination of human professional
    experience, analytical and problem-solving abilities that as at today, cannot
    be replicated in AI systems. A similar limitation applies to the administration
    of justice as no AI system can yet replicate an understanding of applied jurisprudence,
    the rule of law, and equitable human decency and compassion that Judges and law
    enforcers have been trained to understand and apply.

    While corporate law practice  has embraced an appreciable digitalization level,
    it is still a far cry from what obtains in developed jurisdictions. In Nigeria,
    we have not seen much use of AI in legal practice largely due to difficulties
    such as the cost of data, epileptic power supply, insufficient or robust data
    protection laws, the low level of sophistication of many law firms, the general

    the legal market. The adoption of Technology-Assisted Review (TAR)  and other

    one must question whether AI would aid or hamper the administration of justice
    in Nigeria. On the one hand, the mere existence of intelligent tools that can
    automatically formulate sentences, set bail conditions, and determine the likelihood
    of repeat offense would do wonders for our criminal justice system. Not only would
    it lead to a de-congestion of the courtrooms from the arduous processes of criminal
    litigation, but it could also result in many prisoners being freed as well, given
    that the bail process would be made smoother. Theoretically, it is possible that
    the AI system (in tandem with a database of all prisoners) would be able to detect
    persons that have been imprisoned without being charged to court within the timelines
    required by law and automatically submit a request to the prison or station holding
    such person for their immediate release.

    algorithmic AI in sentencing persons because the AI appears to always suffer from
    the biases of the programmer. As such, while Nigeria may not have the same racial
    discrimination as in the United States, it is possible that an AI programmer could
    feed in a sentencing AI program with more localized biases, such as ethnic, religious,
    or classist views. Thus, what if an AI program sentencing offenders starts giving
    harsher sentences to persons of a particular ethnic, religious, or economic class
    while favoring others that are not in those classes? Systems of checks and balances
    would have to be put in place to detect such biases early enough and possibly
    result in reprogramming or shutting down of the malfunctioning AI. These are the
    sort of risks and rewards Nigeria will have to consider in the future when AI

    robots with sentient legal programming installed. The AI counsel and judge would
    all have to be programmed to speak fluent English, given that the language of
    the courtroom is the English language. However, there are clients or witnesses
    that speak different local languages (such as Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, or many other
    Nigerian languages) or are mute; the AI would also have to be programmed in such
    a manner that it can adapt to these variations. The AI lawyer would, for instance,
    have to request for a translator for a witness that only speaks Yoruba, and the
    AI judge would have to understand the nature of the request and be able to call
    for a translator from among the legal staff present in the courtroom or adjourn
    the proceedings’ pending appointment of a translator. All of this would have to
    occur practically within just the first few minutes of a trial. This is just one
    small example of the many difficulties facing AI implementation in legal proceedings.
    The sheer amount of information and probabilities that would need to be accounted

    AI judge or a judge with the assistance of an AI program, reaching decisions regarding
    simple debt claims or other similar issues, as opposed to complex and intricate
    criminal trials. This is especially so because Nigerian civil practice entails
    the system of “frontloading,” which means that all documents intended to be used
    for civil trial must be served on the other parties to the suit and filed in the
    court’s records prior to commencement of trial. As such, AI programs would easily
    scan through and analyze all the relevant processes in a case before the trial

    The AI would scan and read the relevant processes filed by each party, and, based
    on the facts set out, the evidence attached and judicial precedents in similar
    cases, decide on the dispute. This quick AI decision potentially saves parties
    time and costs in pursuing a full legal dispute.

    an intense amount of training and feeding of data into the AI must first be done.
    For instance, an AI would need to be able to spot irregularities in evidence seeking
    to be filed. It would need to assess the data presented by the documents, determine
    which party is entitled to the debt, and make a judgment as to whether the debt
    should be paid. This should be relatively easy in some instances where it is clear
    that a debt is owed, the conditions for repayment have been triggered, and yet
    repayment has not been made. Naturally, complexities would occur when facts around
    the debt are disputed, but we expect AI to learn to adapt to such situations.

    of increased IT proficiency in lawyers at a fast pace. It is a trite legal maxim
    that “a good lawyer is not one that knows the law, but where to find it.” In that
    vein, the future good lawyer may not only be one that knows where to find the
    law but also knows how to use AI systems in the provision of legal services. Although
    AI is indisputably useful, as demonstrated in this chapter, there are limitations
