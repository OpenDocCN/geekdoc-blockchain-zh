    may have been the antennae, which gave it the appearance of a huge metallic insect,
    ready to strike. Swift-moving storm clouds were reflected in its opaque windows,
    and I felt a sense of dread.

    in at the security desk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Nothing.” Pete looked over his glasses at the security check-in screen. “What
    does that say?”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    he’d retained his humor.

- en: We called them our “bank client,” but they were a multinational asset manager
    that controlled over $2 trillion in wealth. Two trillion dollars is hard to imagine—it’s
    a line of dollar bills that would stretch from the earth to the sun, and back—but
    you got a notion of it when you stepped into the conference room.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Wow,” Pete said under his breath.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The dominating impression was the massive conference table, big enough for
    a law school reunion, with an inlaid pattern of contrasting wood: maple, ebony,
    and elm. The conference table alone could be our boss.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even more commanding was our client. Impeccably dressed in an Armani business
    suit and a lavender scarf, her hair and makeup flawless, she sat at the far end
    of the table, typing on her laptop. “Hello, John. Hello, Peter.” She didn’t get
    up.
  prefs: []

- en: “Sooyoung.” I smiled and made my way down the table, past countless leather
    chairs, dropping my bags. “Hey, crazy coincidence. I saw this exact conference
    table yesterday at Ikea.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“Let me videoconference them in.” Pete and I exchanged another look, both thinking
    the same thing: We could have videoconferenced?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sooyoung tapped her keyboard and a video screen covering the far wall began
    to glow a soft azure. It was hard not to be distracted by the pin on Sooyoung’s
    lapel in the shape of the bank’s logo—not to mention the diamond on Sooyoung’s
    finger, which could have illuminated a disco.

- en: Another conference room came to life on the screen. We saw three or four people,
    all typing on their laptops. The placement of the camera was terrible, so we were
    seeing them from the perspective of a small child.

- en: “Okay, I have the compliance team from London,” Sooyoung said. “Hello, everybody!”
    She waved cheerfully.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everybody in London said hello, not looking up. I felt outnumbered. I glanced
    out the twenty-second-story window, where the sky was turning black. If I had
    to jump, I’d first have to break through the safety glass.

    series now.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We have some concerns,” a British bloke in a yellow tie jumped in. “There’s
    too much promissory language. You can’t say, ‘You will own these tokens’; you
    can say, ‘You may own these tokens.’ You can’t say, ‘This is likely a good investment’;
    you can say, ‘This may be a good investment.’ ”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Got it,” Pete agreed. “No problem.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “ ‘Never invest more than you are willing to lose,’ ” he pontificated, “should
    be ‘Never invest more than you can afford to lose.’ He went through his sheaf
    of papers, ticking each point with a pencil. “Every article.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Why do you need so many?”
  prefs: []

- en: “Have you written for financial clients before?” our British pal asked. “This
    is all pretty standard.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “In fact, we have our own financial website, Bitcoin Market Journal,” I responded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You write about bitcoin?” He leaned closer to the camera. The fish-eye Web
    camera gave him the appearance of a cartoon stalker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s one of our areas of specialty.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, no, no,” he laughed. “We absolutely cannot write anything having to do
    with bitcoin.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We’re not writing this for you.” I rubbed my eyes. “That’s our own site.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why do you have so many words?” Sooyoung interjected. “People on the Web don’t
    want to read. They want it short, bite-sized.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You’re hiring us to write words,” I snapped. Pete touched my arm gently.
  prefs: []

    is the technology. We’ve got a whole team working on blockchain. Twenty-five patents.
    Seriously, guys, no bitcoin.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I sighed and shook my head. “You’re missing out . . .” I said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We’re not writing about bitcoin.” Pete gave everyone a reassuring smile. “And
    we can fix the language, Sooyoung. We’ll shorten the articles and take out as
    many ‘the’s as we can. All good?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Good,” Sooyoung said. “Thanks, everybody!” She closed up her laptop and stood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s all,” she replied, smoothing her suit. “Thanks for coming in. Good meeting!”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    paid yet.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    M. Rogers in his 1995 book Diffusion of Innovations. It explains how technologies
    take hold in society.

    In the mid-1990s, everyone predicted that virtual reality was right around the
    corner. I spent countless hours hacking my first PC into a homemade VR rig. Now
    here we are, decades later, and I’m still waiting for decent VR.'

    can all agree that the technology has not yet hit the “majority.” But that wave
    of opportunity is certainly coming, and where do you want to be when it hits?

    “Hey, John,” Pete said, gravely serious for a moment. “Never invest more than
    you can afford to lose.”
  prefs: []

    Banksy, spray paint on steel. “We’ve got to evolve, Pete.”

    in the dough.”

    all these coins. Billions of dollars trading every day. Every transaction, you
    take a cut. You don’t have to do anything!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    millions.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    buy it, we use that money to build the exchange. Have you seen how much these
    coins are raising?”

    Morningstar. Those guys grade all the mutual funds. They’re huge. Just do that,
    but for altcoins.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    us to look at the blockchain market for, like, health care. Like Deloitte.” He
    checked his phone. “Uber’s here.”
