    in our economic, legal, and political systems. They protect assets and set organizational
    boundaries. They establish and verify identities and chronicle events. They govern
    interactions among nations, organizations, communities, and individuals. They
    guide managerial and social action. And yet these critical tools and the bureaucracies
    formed to manage them have not kept up with the economy’s digital transformation.

    the basis for email among the researchers on ARPANET, the U.S. Department of Defense

    was based on “circuit switching,” in which connections between two parties or

    by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small packets, each including address
    information. Once released into the network, the packets could take any route
    to the recipient. Smart sending and receiving nodes at the network’s edges could
    disassemble and reassemble the packets and interpret the encoded data. There was

    Few imagined that robust data, messaging, voice, and video connections could be
    established on the new architecture or that the associated system could be secure

    such as Sun, NeXT, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics, used TCP/IP, in part
    to create *localized* private networks within organizations. To do so, they developed
    building blocks and tools that broadened its use beyond email, gradually replacing
    more-traditional local network technologies and standards. As organizations adopted
    these building blocks and tools, they saw dramatic gains in productivity.

    ownership. If a stock transaction took place on a blockchain-based system, it

    For example, auctions used to be narrow and local, rather than universal and global,
    as they are now on sites like eBay. As the costs of reaching people dropped, there
    was a sudden change in the system. Blockchain is reasonably expected to trigger

  zh: 私有区块链所提供的优势——更快的交易验证和网络通信、修复错误和撤销交易的能力、以及限制访问和降低外部攻击可能性的能力——可能会让潜在用户对系统持谨慎态度。区块链系统存在的必要性预设了一定的不信任程度，或者至少承认所有用户的激励可能并不总是一致的。开发维护比特币等公有区块链系统的开发者仍然依赖于个体用户采纳他们提出的任何更改，这也确保了只有当更改符合整个系统利益时，更改才会被采纳。另一方面，私有区块链的运营者可能会选择单方面部署一些用户持不同意见的更改。为了确保私有区块链系统的安全性和实用性，运营者必须考虑对于那些不同意系统规则更改或缓慢采纳新规则的用户可采取的补救措施。目前运行而未安装最新补丁的操作系统数量充分表明，即使是不具争议性的更改也不会被迅速采纳。
- en: While the risks of building a financial market or other infrastructure on a
    public blockchain may give a new entrant pause, private blockchains offer a degree
    of control over both participant behavior and the transaction verification process.
    The use of a blockchain-based system is a signal of the transparency and usability
    of that system, which are bolstered by the early consideration of the system’s
    security. Just as a business will decide which of its systems are better hosted
    on a more secure private intranet or on the internet, but will likely use both,
    systems requiring fast transactions, the possibility of transaction reversal,
    and central control over transaction verification will be better suited for private
    blockchains, while those that benefit from widespread participation, transparency,
    and third-party verification will flourish on a public blockchain.

    This is a very serious problem. The consequences of a baby being mistaken for

    seems like a great use of blockchain technology.

    digital records may be immutable and verifiable, but how does someone know which
    digital record is attached to which baby? To link an entry on the blockchain to
    an actual, real-life baby, we need to give the baby a physical identifier through
    a physical tag, or in a more futuristic world, a small chip or digital genome
    record that links the baby to its digital record. And this is where blockchain
    falls down. It can’t help with this process and can’t verify that perhaps the
    most important step of verification is happening correctly.

  zh: 但是使用区块链来解决这个问题有一个很大的问题。数字记录可能是不可变且可验证的，但人们如何知道哪个数字记录附属于哪个婴儿呢？为了将区块链上的条目与一个真实生活中的婴儿联系起来，我们需要通过一个物理标签给婴儿一个物理标识，或者在一个更未来的世界里，一个小芯片或数字基因组记录，将婴儿与其数字记录联系起来。而这也是区块链的不足之处。它不能帮助这个过程，也不能验证或许最重要的验证步骤是否正确进行。

    usefulness of the technology still critically depends on trusted intermediaries
    to effectively bridge the last mile between a digital record and a physical individual,

    on humans to correctly and honestly implement the match between baby and digital
    record. And if humans get that wrong or manipulate the data when it is entered,
    in a system where records are believed ex post as having integrity, this can have
    serious negative consequences.

- en: There are other parallel examples. Within marketing, one issue that often comes
    up is that a pair of eyeballs that an advertiser is paying for may not actually
    belong to the person they’re supposed to. The advertiser might think it’s paying
    to show an ad to a mid-thirties male in the market for a Lamborghini, but the
    ad might actually be shown to a minivan-driving academic who has no intention
    of buying another car for kids to wreck but who likes to dream. Or, even worse,
    a bot could be viewing the ad. Blockchain technology can track which digital identifiers
    are associated with the viewing of an ad, but it cannot help with verifying humanness
    or the honesty of a buyer’s intentions. Verifying who’s actually behind the digital
    identifier requires offline verification. Verifying the honesty of apparent buying
    intentions is perhaps beyond any technology we possess today.

  zh: 还有其他的平行例子。在市场营销中，经常出现的一个问题是，广告商支付的眼球可能实际上并不属于他们应该属于的人。广告商可能认为他们支付的是向一个30多岁的想要购买兰博基尼的男士展示广告，但广告实际上可能展示给一个开着面包车的学者，这位学者没有购买另一辆车的打算，只是喜欢幻想。或者，更糟糕的是，一个机器人可能在观看广告。区块链技术可以追踪与广告观看相关的数字标识，但它无法帮助验证人性或买家的诚实意图。验证数字标识背后实际上是哪个人需要离线验证。验证购买意图的诚实性或许超出了我们今天所拥有的任何技术。
- en: On the bright side, blockchain technology can be used to change the relationship
    between digital content creators, advertisers, and consumers. Advertisers can
    reward users for their attention by giving them access to exclusive online content
    they would otherwise have to pay for. Content creators can explore new monetization
    models that benefit from blockchain’s ability to cheaply and effectively settle
    transactions. While consumers hate micropayments because of the mental costs they
    involve—micropayments are like a hated “taxi meter” in consumers’ heads—this could
    reshape how paywalls and subscriptions work behind the scenes across different
    digital properties. Moreover, if we are not worried about verifying a pair of
    eyeballs’ humanness, but instead want to ensure ownership over digital records
    such as browsing data, then blockchain can work perfectly. One of the issues we
    face constantly in establishing the economics of privacy is the issue of property
    rights over data. And blockchain is perfectly positioned to define them.

  zh: 从积极方面来看，区块链技术可以改变数字内容创作者、广告商和消费者之间的关系。广告商可以通过向用户提供访问他们本需付费的独家在线内容的机会来奖励他们的注意力。内容创作者可以探索新的盈利模式，这些模式利用了区块链在廉价和高效地解决交易方面的能力。虽然消费者讨厌微支付，因为微支付涉及的心理成本很高——在消费者看来，微支付就像一个令人讨厌的“出租车计价器”——这可能会改变付费墙和订阅背后的运作方式，这种方式横跨不同的数字属性。此外，如果我们不再担心验证一对眼睛的人类属性，而是想确保对诸如浏览数据之类的数字记录的所有权，那么区块链可以完美地发挥作用。我们在建立隐私经济的经济学时不断面临的一个问题就是数据产权问题。而区块链恰好可以定义这些问题。
