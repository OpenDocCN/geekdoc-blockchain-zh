    we know about technology adoption and, in particular, the transformation process
    typical of other foundational technologies. One of the most relevant examples
    is distributed computer networking technology, seen in the adoption of TCP/IP
    (transmission control protocol/internet protocol), which laid the groundwork for
    the development of the internet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Introduced in 1972, TCP/IP first gained traction in a *single-use* case: as
    the basis for email among the researchers on ARPANET, the U.S. Department of Defense
    precursor to the commercial internet. Before TCP/IP, telecommunications architecture
    was based on “circuit switching,” in which connections between two parties or
    machines had to be preestablished and sustained throughout an exchange. To ensure
    that any two nodes could communicate, telecom service providers and equipment
    manufacturers had invested billions in building dedicated lines.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TCP/IP turned that model on its head. The new protocol transmitted information
    by digitizing it and breaking it up into very small packets, each including address
    information. Once released into the network, the packets could take any route
    to the recipient. Smart sending and receiving nodes at the network’s edges could
    disassemble and reassemble the packets and interpret the encoded data. There was
    no need for dedicated private lines or massive infrastructure. TCP/IP created
    an open, shared public network without any central authority or party responsible
    for its maintenance and improvement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditional telecommunications and computing sectors looked on TCP/IP with skepticism.
    Few imagined that robust data, messaging, voice, and video connections could be
    established on the new architecture or that the associated system could be secure
    and scale up. But during the late 1980s and 1990s, a growing number of firms,
    such as Sun, NeXT, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics, used TCP/IP, in part
    to create *localized* private networks within organizations. To do so, they developed
    building blocks and tools that broadened its use beyond email, gradually replacing
    more-traditional local network technologies and standards. As organizations adopted
    these building blocks and tools, they saw dramatic gains in productivity.
  prefs: []

    the mid-1990s. New technology companies quickly emerged to provide the “plumbing”—the
    hardware, software, and services needed to connect to the now-public network and
    exchange information. Netscape commercialized browsers, web servers, and other
    tools and components that aided the development and adoption of internet services
    and applications. Sun drove the development of Java, the application-programming
    language. As information on the web grew exponentially, Infoseek, Excite, AltaVista,
    and Yahoo were born to guide users around it.

    took advantage of low-cost connectivity by creating internet services that were
    compelling *substitutes* for existing businesses. CNET moved news online. Amazon

    to buy airline tickets and brought unprecedented transparency to the process.

    a core function of any business. Those records track past actions and performance
    and guide planning for the future. They provide a view not only of how the organization
    works internally but also of the organization’s outside relationships. Every organization
    keeps its own records, and they’re private. Many organizations have no master
    ledger of all their activities; instead records are distributed across internal
    units and functions. The problem is, reconciling transactions across individual
    and private ledgers takes a lot of time and is prone to error.

    often without human intervention. However, the settlement—the ownership transfer
    of the stock—can take as long as a week. That’s because the parties have no access
    to each other’s ledgers and can’t automatically verify that the assets are in
    fact owned and can be transferred. Instead a series of intermediaries act as guarantors
    of assets as the record of the transaction traverses organizations and the ledgers
    are individually updated.

    databases, each hosted and maintained by an interested party. When changes are
    entered in one copy, all the other copies are simultaneously updated. So as transactions
    occur, records of the value and assets exchanged are permanently entered in all
    ledgers. There is no need for third-party intermediaries to verify or transfer
    ownership. If a stock transaction took place on a blockchain-based system, it
    would be settled within seconds, securely and verifiably. (The infamous hacks
    that have hit bitcoin exchanges exposed weaknesses not in the blockchain itself

    technology and its business use cases evolve. The first is novelty—the degree
    to which an application is new to the world. The more novel it is, the more effort
    will be required to ensure that users understand what problems it solves. The
    second dimension is complexity, represented by the level of ecosystem coordination
    involved—the number and diversity of parties that need to work together to produce
    value with the technology. For example, a social network with just one member
    is of little use; a social network is worthwhile only when many of your own connections
    have signed on to it. Other users of the application must be brought on board
    to generate value for all participants. The same will be true for many blockchain
    applications. And, as the scale and impact of those applications increase, their
    adoption will require significant institutional change.

    innovation falls into will help executives understand the types of challenges
    it presents, the level of collaboration and consensus it needs, and the legislative
    and regulatory efforts it will require. The map will also suggest what kind of
    processes and infrastructure must be established to facilitate the innovation’s
    adoption. Managers can use it to assess the state of blockchain development in
    any industry, as well as to evaluate strategic investments in their own blockchain
    capabilities.

    its value rose with the number of users). Bitcoin, too, falls into this quadrant.
    Even in its early days, bitcoin offered immediate value to the few people who
    used it simply as an alternative payment method. (You can think of it as a complex
    email that transfers not just information but also actual value.) At the end of
    2016 the value of bitcoin transactions was expected to hit $92 billion. That’s
    still a rounding error compared with the $411 trillion in total global payments,

    These innovations aim to replace entire ways of doing business. They face high
    barriers to adoption, however; not only do they require more coordination but
    the processes they hope to replace may be full-blown and deeply embedded within
    organizations and institutions. Examples of substitutes include cryptocurrencies—new,
    fully formed currency systems that have grown out of the simple bitcoin payment
    technology. The critical difference is that a cryptocurrency requires every party
    that does monetary transactions to adopt it, challenging governments and institutions

    the rules and the network checks for compliance. If a transaction breaks the rules

    Even bitcoin’s “monetary policy” is written into its code: New money is issued
    every 10 minutes, and the supply is limited so there will only ever be 21 million

    puzzle. The process by which a network of nodes confirms the record of previously
    verified transactions, and by which it verifies new transactions, is known as
    a consensus protocol. In the bitcoin system, because no user is implicitly trusted
    to verify transactions, all users follow an algorithm that verifies transactions
    by committing software and hardware resources to solving a problem by brute force
    (that is, by solving the cryptographic puzzle). The user who reaches the solution
    first is rewarded, and each new solution, along with the transactions that were
    used to verify it, forms the basis for the next problem to be solved.

    control over who can read the ledger of verified transactions, who can submit
    transactions, and who can verify them. The applications for private blockchains
    include a variety of markets in which multiple parties wish to participate simultaneously
    but do not fully trust one another. For example, private blockchain systems supporting
    land and physical asset registries, commodities trading, and private equity distribution
    are all being tested. As these systems develop and evolve, they, too, may encounter
    unexpected consequences, some of which will have repercussions for the security
    of the system and the assets it manages or stores. As in software and product
    development, considering security at an early stage alleviates the difficulty
    of making fundamental changes to a product to address a security flaw later on.

    about the network architecture of the system. Blockchains achieve consensus on
    their ledger, the list of verified transactions, through communication, and communication
    is required to write and approve new transactions. This communication occurs between
    nodes, each of which maintains a copy of the ledger and informs the other nodes
    of new information: newly submitted or newly verified transactions. Private blockchain
    operators can control who is allowed to operate a node, as well as how those nodes
    are connected; a node with more connections will receive information faster. Likewise,
    nodes may be required to maintain a certain number of connections to be considered
    active. A node that restricts the transmission of information, or transmits incorrect
    information, must be identifiable and circumventable to maintain the integrity
    of the system. A private blockchain underlying commodities trading may grant more-central
    positions in the network to established trading partners and may require new nodes
    to maintain a connection to one of these central nodes as a security measure to
    ensure it behaves as expected.'

    to treat uncommunicative or intermittently active nodes. Nodes may go offline
    for innocuous reasons, but the network must be structured to function (to obtain
    consensus on previously verified transactions and to correctly verify new transactions)
    without the offline nodes, and it must be able to quickly bring these nodes back
    up to speed if they return.

    they are sufficiently “deep” enough in the ledger that introducing a competing
    version of the ledger, known as a fork, would be computationally expensive. This

    the use of bitcoin-based systems for fast-paced transactions, such as financial

    for bitcoin transactions is the exchange of bitcoin itself. Each bitcoin transaction
    includes unique text strings that are associated with the bitcoins being exchanged.
    Similarly, other blockchain systems record the possession of assets or shares
    involved in a transaction. In the bitcoin system, ownership is demonstrated through
    the use of a private key (a long number generated by an algorithm designed to
    provide a random and unique output) that is linked to a payment, and despite the
    value of these keys, like any data, they can be stolen or lost, just like cash.
    These thefts are not a failure of the security of bitcoin, but of personal security;
    the thefts are the result of storing a private key insecurely. Some estimates
    put the value of lost bitcoins in the billions.

    need to reside somewhere. Bitcoin currently provides no recourse for those who
    have lost their private keys; similarly, stolen bitcoins are nearly impossible
    to recover, as transactions submitted with stolen keys appear to a verifying node
    to be indistinguishable from legitimate transactions.

    fairness and impartiality of the system, but a system that permits extensive losses
    as a result of the exploitation of bugs will lose users. This is illustrated by
    the case of The DAO, a code-based venture capital fund designed to run on Ethereum,
    a public blockchain-based platform. Security vulnerabilities in the code operating
    The DAO led to financial losses that required Ethereum’s developers to make changes
    to the Ethereum protocol itself, even though The DAO’s vulnerabilities were not
    the fault of the Ethereum protocol. The decision to make these changes was controversial
    and underscores the idea that both public and private blockchain developers should
    consider circumstances under which they would face a similar decision.

    cause prospective users to be wary of the system. The need for a blockchain system
    at all presupposes a degree of mistrust, or at least an acknowledgment that all
    users’ incentives may not be aligned. Developers who work to maintain public blockchain
    systems like bitcoin still rely on individual users to adopt any changes they
    propose, which serves to ensure that changes are only adopted if they are in the
    interest of the entire system. The operators of a private blockchain, on the other
    hand, may choose to unilaterally deploy changes with which some users disagree.
    To ensure both the security and the utility of a private blockchain system, operators
    must consider the recourse available to users who disagree with changes to the
    system’s rules or are slow to adopt the new rules. The number of operating systems
    currently running without the latest patch is a strong indication that even uncontroversial
    changes will not be adopted quickly.
