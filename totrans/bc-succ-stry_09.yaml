    the world’s leading blockchain platforms. It is a self-described *third-generation*
    platform, seeking to improve on the first-generation (bitcoin) and second-generation
    (Ethereum) models.
  prefs: []

- en: If Ethereum can be described as a platform for building new decentralized applications
    (dapps), the vision for Cardano might be described as a *better Ethereum*. Specifically,
    Cardano seeks to be a blockchain development platform that’s more scalable and
    more interoperable, two areas where Ethereum has struggled (see our CryptoKitties
    case study in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#six_cryptokitties_blockchain_based_coll)).
    Developers, in other words, can use Cardano as a foundation for creating new blockchain
    applications—like Ethereum, but better.

    a rigorous academic model than a go-go internet startup. Developers and engineers
    from top schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University

    and updates to Cardano, through a *blockchain development process* that serves
    as a best practice for technology leaders.

    “money” that other applications can use as payment.
