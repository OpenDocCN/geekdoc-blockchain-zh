- en: In ancient times, humans were much predisposed to utilizing their hand-created
    tools to finish any kind of work. From the last few years, businesses related
    to production have been expanding. People began to rely on tools, machines, and
    smart gadgets to process their work, as these kinds of tools help them to achieve
    their target in the given time. . Since the 18^(th) century, the world has experienced
    a lot of revolutions in industry across the globe. This type of growth in technology
    has made a base for industrial revolutions. New technology was introduced called
    “blockchain.”Probably, blockchain technology is the most disruptive technology
    in the modern digital economy. The ability of blockchain technology has been greatly
    described in many research works, media, and majorly in the fields of finance
    and payment. One existing research is at the organizational stage, where it implements
    the architecture for internet safety as well as inconvertibility. “Industry 4.0”
    and “IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)” are involved in its rising applications.
    Thus, in this paper, current applications of blockchain in IIoT as well as Industry
    4.0 setups, existing open issues, modern application sectors, challenges related
    to IIoT, and their solutions are illustrated. The main focus of this paper is
    to empower and facilitate research in this field, which will help the developers
    in blockchain acquisition as well as investment in the “Industry 4.0” and “Industrial
    Internet of Things” space.

- en: Undoubtedly, blockchain technology is an unpretentious invention. Blockchain
    structured the backbone of a modern kind of internet by permitting digital information
    to be disseminated but not replicated. Genuinely, invented for the digital currency,
    *i.e.*, Bitcoin, the tech organization has now discovered other efficient usages
    of this technology [[1](#c6r1)]. Thus, in simple words, a blockchain is a time-stamped
    sequence of inconvertible collections of information that is handled by a network
    of computers and not owned by any individual entity [[2](#c6r2)]. Each of these
    digital blocks is defended and limited to each other by employing a public database
    (*i.e.*, chain) [[3](#c6r3)]. In the network, by using cryptographic principles
    to keep data sharing safe, blockchain technology gives a decentralized database
    or digital ledger of transactions to everyone [[4](#c6r4)]. Basically, this network
    is a series of computer systems that must allow sharing before it can be authenticated
    and stored. There are many core elements of blockchain, but only the three most
    necessary elements are described. The first element is a block in which every
    chain includes several blocks, and each block has three fundamental components
    such as the data stored in the block is the first component [[5](#c6r5)]. A whole
    number of 32-bit is known as a nonce. In the second component, when a block is
    generated, it is randomly created which further then, produces a block header
    hash [[6](#c6r6)]. In third, a number of 256-bit called hash is wedded to the
    nonce. It must begin with a large number of 0s that is, it will be enormously
    small [[7](#c6r7)]. A nonce creates the cryptographic hash after the generation
    of the first block of a chain. The data in the block is considered as signed and
    forever linked to the nonce as well as hash until it is mined [[8](#c6r8)]. The
    second element is a miner. Through a procedure known as mining, miners produce
    fresh blocks on the chain. In a blockchain, every block has its own unrepeatable
    hash as well as a nonce, but also, it references the hash of the preceding block
    in the chain [[9](#c6r9)]. So, It is not simple to mine a block, specifically
    on huge chains. To solve the complicated math problem of finding a nonce that
    produces an admissible hash, special software is used by miners, because the nonce
    is only 32 bits and the hash is 256 bits. There are approximately 4 billion plausible
    combinations of nonce-hash that must be mined just before searching the correction
    [[10](#c6r10)]. When that occurs, miners have to search the “golden nonce” and
    their data is included in the database. Any kind of modification is accepted by
    all the nodes of the network and the miner is rewarded financially after triumphing
    mining of a block [[11](#c6r11)]. The third element is Node. Decentralization
    is one of the most significant topics in blockchain technology. The chain cannot
    be owned by a computer system or a company [[12](#c6r12)]. Rather, it is a disseminated
    ledger through which nodes are linked to the chain. Nodes (in any form of electronic
    gadget) manage replicas of the blockchain as well as maintains the functioning
    of the network. A major application of blockchain technology is to record financial
    information with a protected sharing. There have been efforts to enucleate as
    well as expand the usages of the blockchain technology beyond the field of finance
    and to other sectors namely, supply chain, automobile, healthcare, production,
    education, and banking [[13](#c6r13)]. It is widely classified that, “Blockchain
    1.0” is typically linked with digital currency, for example, smart contracts,
    Bitcoin.“Blockchain 2.0” is connected with the help of automated digital finance
    processes, and also, the popular technology *i.e.* “Blockchain 3.0”. It is concentrated
    on considering the requirements of the digital community like smart homes, smart
    banking, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 [[14](#c6r14)]. The fourth industrial
    revolution is hugely powered by IoT and other associated technologies. Here is
    another concept of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) or Industrial IoT which
    has a more particular concentration while the fourth revolution of the industry
    is basically linked with an intelligent industry arrangement. The conversion from
    conventional industry to intelligent industry or IndustrialIoT is supported by
    the inter-associativity as well as the digitalization of our community and spreading
    of IoT gadgets [[15](#c6r15)].

    it plausible for data access to be much faster. The atmosphere of businesses is
    getting involved in this frequent evolution of technology. Gradually, the industrial
    field has been consolidating greater applications of automation and associativity.
    For 2020, “Industry 4.0” was proposed in the year 2011, at the Hanover event,
    Germany. In the revolution of industry, Industry 4.0 implies tobe the modern stage
    that concentrates mainly on inter-associativity, ML (machine learning), real-time
    data, and automation [[16](#c6r16)]. Also, it is sometimes implied as IIoT or
    smart production. Before going too much deeper, it is advantageous to first know
    how production has evolved since the 1800s. There are four different industrial
    revolutions as shown in (Fig. [**1**](#c6f1)) that the world either has faced
    today [[17](#c6r17)].

    and applications. Including a large concentration on big data, machine learning,
    and M2M (machine-to-machine communication), IIoT provides enterprises and factories
    to have better optimization, capacity, and stability in their implementations.
    Also, it encircles industrial applications, including healthcare gadgets, software-defined
    manufacturing procedures, and robotics too [[20](#c6r20)]. Generally, IIoT is
    the usage of smart actuators as well as sensors to boost production and industrial
    procedures. Sometimes, it is also considered as the “Industry 4.0” or “Industrial
    Internet”. The main concept behind the IIoT is that smart machines are better
    than humans for evaluating data in real-time, and they are also preferred at interacting
    significant information that can be applied to make effective decisions faster
    and more precisely related to business [[21](#c6r21)].

    as M2M *i.e.* machine-to-machine communications, sensors and actuators, associativity,
    cloud platforms, and also, data analytics which can be applied for distinct objectives.
    The application of IoT is to link gadgets across many sectors namely, healthcare,
    enterprises, agriculture, automobile, customer and utilities, and also, including
    government and cities. Smart gadgets, fitness bands, and many other applications
    that normally don’t generate emergency circumstances if something goes amiss are
    included in IoT gadgets. While, on the other hand, the IIoT links gadgets as well
    as machines which further helps in production and utilities. System failures and
    downtime in deployments of the IIoT can produce high-risk cases or even life-threatening
    circumstances. The application of IIoT is more focused on enhancing capacity and
    increasing health or safety, in opposition to the user-concentrated nature of
    applications of IoT [[22](#c6r22)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the major issues experienced in handling the record of the patient is
    that the patient leaves their medical associated information disseminated across
    several suppliers of healthcare. The composition of EHRs (Electronic Health Records)
    is not easy to handle and cannot scatter across several industrial setups. Moreover,
    the issues lie between several healthcare organizations as well as service suppliers
    who generate more obstacles for the victorious for exchanging of information [[25](#c6r25)].
    This deficit of adjusted management of data as well as information sharing refers
    to that these medical records are not unified, but instead are segmented. Blockchain
    technology supports in giving a design for data exchanging along with the safety
    of this information. In this manner, medical care suppliers can collect details
    from the patients which may comprise their name, DOB (date of birth), prescription
    adhered, past processes performed, and other necessary details. By using cloud
    computing, this information is then recorded on the networks in the current databases
    of organizations. After that, from each source of information, a cryptographic
    hash of the information is computed and then, transferred along with the patient’s
    public ID which is to be recorded in the blockchain [[26](#c6r26)]. In this situation,
    smart contracts are a better option to handle the access of patient’s information.
    The medical care providers can query the blockchain and then, place this info
    through an API without exposing the identity of the patient.

    for safety applications [[27](#c6r27)]. Moreover, blockchain remains private while
    it is transparent, concealing the recognition of any character with complicated

    consumers to accept the concept of blockchain technology. Most of the existing
    solutions are based on this gathered data through IoT sensors. Hence, additionally,
    paying for the subscription of the blockchain, the included organizations have
    to compensate for the implementation of the Internet of Things. Secondly, collecting
    the info uploaded to a blockchain platform can be very expensive, which will be
    an obstacle to the acceptance of blockchain in the agriculture industry. Thirdly,
    a blockchain does not straightly seamlessly combine with current legacy systems
    and constructing a structure to apply the blockchain technology, which is often
