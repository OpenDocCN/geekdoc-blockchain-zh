- en: IoT has made ubiquitous computing a reality by extending Internet connectivity
    in various applications deployed across the globe. IoT connects billions of objects
    for high-speed data transfer, especially in a 5G-enabled industrial environment
    for information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control
    mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices, and protocols used may
    not be applicable in the future as these protocols are based upon a centralized
    mechanism. This centralized mechanism may have a single point of failure along-with
    the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized
    access control mechanism for D2D communication in various industrial sectors,
    for example, sensors in different regions may collect and process the data for
    making intelligent decisions. In such an environment, security and privacy are
    major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized control
    mechanism.
