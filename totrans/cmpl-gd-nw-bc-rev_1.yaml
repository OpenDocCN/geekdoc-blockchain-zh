- en: This book is meant to serve as a guide to help you understand what blockchain
    is and how to leverage its benefits. It’s in no way intended to be a professional
    manual for anything including trading. If you need cryptocurrency trading advice,
    consult a professional financial analyst.

- en: First, let me congratulate you for purchasing this book and “thank you” for
    choosing this copy. While you may not understand most of the basics behind blockchain,
    I’m sure you know about Bitcoin and perhaps, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash. Well, all
    these digital currencies have one thing in common; they are written on the blockchain.

- en: But that’s not all. Blockchain has many other functions besides providing cryptocurrencies
    with a basis to operate on. This technology is regarded as the next big thing
    after the internet itself and therefore, learning its ins and outs can help you
    leverage its advantages in the digital world.

- en: Since much about blockchain can be confusing, this book has been written in
    most basic language, so even a tenth-grader can understand much of the concepts
    discussed. We will kick off by defining what this tech is, how it operates, its
    applications, merits, demerits and how it’s likely to change as the years go by.

- en: This book won’t touch on the complex algorithms on how this technology is curated
    or anything that makes you think you are back in college dealing with advanced
    algebra. Once again, there is an overwhelming number of blockchain books out there,
    so thank you for making this one your number one choice.
