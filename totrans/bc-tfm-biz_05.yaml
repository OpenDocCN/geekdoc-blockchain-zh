- en: Over the past 100 years, the world has seen an extraordinary growth in welfare.
    Across the board, the world today is in a much better state, economically, than
    it was 100 years ago. Although it may seem that the world is on fire at the moment,
    with ongoing wars in Syria, the Yemeni crisis, or the terrorist threat from ISIS
    that killed thousands of people and left millions fleeing their country, or the
    Mexican Drug war that has killed over 80,000 people since 2006 [142], nothing
    can be further from the truth. On almost all levels, life on earth has improved
    in the past 100 years from our life expectancy, the number of people living in
    democratic countries, to the number of people living in extreme poverty. Thanks
    to significantly improved healthcare, as well as better living and working conditions,
    life expectancy has increased rapidly in the past 100 years, from 34.1 years in
    1913 to 71.4 years in 2015 [143]. In addition, the child mortality rate fell from
    43% of the world’s newborns who would die before their fifth birthday in 1800,
    due to the poor health conditions, to only 4.3% in 2015\. Although 4.3% of all
    newborns who die in childhood is still too high, it is quite an achievement [144].
    Thanks to better food production, the number of famine victims fell drastically
    from 578 global deaths per 100,000 population in the 1950s to 3 global deaths
    per 100,000 population in the 2000s [145]. Also, the number of people living in
    a democracy increased significantly over the past 100 years. In 1900, almost 200
    million people, or 11.97% of the world’s population, lived in a democracy. In
    2015, that number grew to 4.1 billion people, or 55.8% of the world’s population
    [146]. Finally, thanks to technological advancements, global poverty has also
    been reduced significantly in the past 100 years. The percentage of people living
    in extreme poverty^([1](#note1)) [147] dropped from 94.4% in 1820 to 9.6% in 2015
    [147]. This achievement is predominantly attributable to the past three decades,
    because only as recently as 1980 the percentage was still 44% [147]. The third
    industrial revolution, the information age, which started in the 1970s and brought
    us mainframe computing, personal computing, and the internet, has enabled millions
    of people to leave poverty and become connected to the global economy. Unfortunately,
    9.6% of the world’s population still live in extreme poverty—that is, 700 million
    people, which is still 700 million people too many. The vast majority of these
    people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [147]. However, developing countries
    also still experience poverty, which, unfortunately and interestingly, has been
    on the rise in recent years, especially in Europe. The International Labour Organization
    estimated that, in 2012, over 300 million people in developed countries were living
    in poverty [148]. This high number is linked to the wave of refugees who have
    fled to Europe in the past three years [149].

    in general the causes for poverty include: lack of education, environmental problems,
    lack of access to banking facilities, lack of legal ownership of property, lack
    of rule of law, overpopulation, epidemic diseases, weather-related events, war,
    and changing trends in a country’s economy. Overcoming poverty is vital if we
    want to create a world that is peaceful and fair for everyone. Besides which,
    in 2015 the United Nations adopted its Sustainable Development Goals that challenge
    global leaders to help end poverty in all its forms, everywhere, by 2030\. Therefore,
    it is time to get to work and lift the remaining 700 million people out of extreme

    Sandy moved over Haiti in 2012, it displaced over 18,000 people, many of whom
    were still living in UN camps after the devastating earthquake of 2010 [150].
    Those displaced people have to live in poor conditions, directly affecting their
    health. If they become ill, their capacity to work will be negatively impacted
    and, with a lack of a social security system in place, the line to poverty is
    easily crossed. It is often a vicious circle that is difficult to break and the
    effects of poverty are often passed on from one generation to the next. The effects
    of poverty are often interrelated, rarely occurring alone, and are, therefore,
    difficult to solve. Poverty is a true Wicked Problem, which will require the involvement
    of all stakeholders, collaborating with each other, using the latest technologies

- en: Poverty has a direct impact on the ability of someone to purchase sufficient
    nutritious food and water. Whether in developing or developed countries, malnutrition
    as a result of poverty is also a catalyst for poverty. Often, the healthiest and
    most nutritious food is also the most expensive. For these reasons, people with
    small budgets often have less nutritious diets due to their dependence on cheaper
    ‘fast’ food. Thus, their children grow up without the required nutrition, which
    has an impact on their ability to learn, play, and grow. In addition, too much
    fast food results in obesity, with all the associated health consequences. Poverty
    will, therefore, almost always result in severe health effects, whether in developing
    or developed countries. The lack of nutrition and proper medicine, the (easy)
    access to healthcare facilities, or the lack of proper sanitation conditions negatively
    influence people’s life expectancies. In addition, lack of healthcare insurance
    stops people from seeking care because they cannot afford the treatments or medicine,
    thereby making their situation deteriorate. Children who are sick or suffer from
    malnutrition will have difficulty concentrating at school, if they get the chance
    to attend a school at all. In developing countries, many children are sent to
    work as soon as they can stand, in order to earn money for the family. Lack of
    education results in illiteracy, which can haunt them throughout their lives.
    The effect of illiteracy is that they will have difficulty getting a job, resulting
    in rising unemployment rates, uncertainty, and a growing informal economy, which
    limits a government from improving the situation for the country as a whole, due
    to lack of income. Many of the poor people living in informal economies do not
    have a documented identity, thereby limiting them from access to many (government)
    resources and activities. In addition, the rise of robots and automation will
    make things worse in the coming years, reducing even further the number of available
    jobs for those who are uneducated. Consequently, social unrest can develop and
    quickly derail a society. This effect played out during the Arab Spring in early
    2011, where a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions
    spread across the Middle East. The chaos and lawlessness were fuelled by political
    uncertainty and quickly led to increased job insecurity and higher levels of poverty.

  zh: 贫困直接影响某人购买足够营养食品和水的能力。无论是在发展中国家还是发达国家，贫困导致的营养不良也是贫困的催化剂。通常，最健康、最有营养的食品也是最昂贵的。正因为如此，预算有限的人常常因为依赖更便宜的“快餐”食品而摄入较少的营养。因此，他们的孩子成长过程中缺乏必需的营养，这对他们的学习能力、玩耍能力和成长能力都有影响。此外，过多的快餐会导致肥胖，带来所有相关的健康后果。因此，贫困几乎总是会导致严重的健康问题，无论是在发展中国家还是发达国家。营养不良和适当的医疗保健设施的缺乏、获得医疗服务的机会（容易）以及适当的卫生条件不足都会负面影响人们的预期寿命。此外，缺乏医疗保险使人们在负担不起治疗或药物的情况下不敢寻求医疗照顾，从而使他们的状况恶化。生病或营养不良的孩子在学校里很难集中注意力，如果他们有机会上学的话。在发展中国家，许多孩子一旦能够站立，就会被送去工作，以赚取家庭收入。缺乏教育会导致文盲，这可能会伴随他们一生。文盲的影响是他们找工作困难，导致失业率上升、不确定性增加以及非正式经济不断增长，这限制了政府因收入不足而改善整个国家状况的能力。许多生活在非正式经济中的贫困人口没有户籍身份，从而限制了他们获取许多（政府）资源和活动的能力。此外，机器人和自动化的兴起将在未来几年使情况变得更糟，进一步减少那些没有受过教育的人的工作机会。因此，社会动荡可能会发展起来，并迅速使社会脱轨。这一效应在2011年初的阿拉伯之春中得到了体现，当时一系列反政府抗议、起义和武装叛乱在中东蔓延。混乱和无政府状态是由政治不确定性引发的，并迅速导致就业不安全感增加和贫困水平升高。
- en: Breaking the cycle of poverty starts with investing in children and providing
    them with sufficient high-quality food, a proper education, knowledge, and skills
    to enable them to realise their full potential. Next to education comes access
    to affordable proper healthcare (including insurance), access to clean water and
    sanitation, and, last but not least, economic security and connecting poor people
    to the (global) economy by offering them an identity, access to banking facilities,
    and the right of ownership. Economic security includes registration of property
    ownership, access to banking facilities, and a fair and transparent rule of law,
    which includes rules that everyone understands and respects. Especially in developing
    countries these three economic securities (property ownership, access to banking
    facilities, and rule of law) are often lacking. As a result, these countries often
    have a large informal economy, which results in less respect for ownership or
    financial and legal rights, making it expensive to abide by the law.

    Next to the absence of property rights, the lack of rule of law [153] and of access

    to emerging technologies. Healthcare organisations tend to have a vast array of
    data stored across the organisation, ranging from patient, medicine, and supplier
    data to financial, insurance, and staff data. Healthcare organisations can mix
    and match their data, combine it with valuable external data sources, such as
    social media data, to enable the healthcare organisation to better determine risks
    (including financial risks, clinical risks, or operational risks), predict operational
    performances and act accordingly, and create a single view of the healthcare organisation
    as well as the patient at any given moment in time. However, at this time, much
    of this information is stored and conveyed in handwritten notes or faxed between
    healthcare professionals and centres and their support organisations. This old-fashioned
    system satisfies regulatory requirements for protection of patient data, but is
    plagued by delay, handling failures, and errors. This is a security problem in
    need of a reliable and trustworthy solution. A complete overview of the patient
    can eventually lead to personalised medicine that will offer the patient better
    treatment than standard medicine. Combined with emerging technology such as artificial
    intelligence, Blockchain and drones, healthcare can be significantly improved.

    Electronic Health Record for patients in Africa. The organisation, let’s call
    it AHealth, has partnered with many local doctors and provided them with tablets
    to record any patient data, which will be stored on a permissioned, private Blockchain.
    The first time someone visits a doctor who is a partner with AHealth, the doctor
    will create a new patient record that will include a variety of personalised identifiable
    information such as name, address, age, height, weight, blood type, and perhaps
    even a DNA sample. All the information will be tokenised, encrypted, and stored
    on the Blockchain. The patient is in full control of who has access to his or
    her personal data, similar to the self-sovereign identity discussed in [Chapter
    3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml). Using a centralised storage system, as is common these
    days, would not be sufficient, because it would take away control of the data
    from the patient. Only the patient and the doctor will be able to view any patient-specific
    data and, if another doctor or organisation needs to get access to the data for
    health reasons, the patient can release only information that is required, cryptographically,
    using the private key on a smartphone. No longer does the patient or doctor have
    to carry paper documents on different patients, with the risk of losing them or
    mixing up records.

    health problems or when a patient needs to be transported to hospital, the advantage
    is that the hospital has access to all the records of the patients, including
    any medicines that have been delivered by drone, and so can develop a better treatment

    healthcare identity system, would give patients and doctors all the advantages
    of digital records while ensuring privacy for the patient. Of course, any company
    dealing with health data on blockchain should ensure privacy for its users by
    giving full control to the user and ensuring that data remains private. This could
    be achieved, for example, by using Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). ZKP ensures that
    data can be shared without leaking personal information and one party can prove
    a certain fact without revealing that information. However, giving full control
    of healthcare data to the patient also creates a significant challenge, because,
    as discussed in [Chapter 3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml), the Public Key Infrastructure
    is an important aspect of this. Loss of the private key would cause problems for
    the patient to remain in full control. Therefore, any start-up working in this

    offers people more freedom to save and spend money how, where, and when they like.
    Unfortunately, for poor people it has become very difficult to open a bank account
    and/or get a loan to improve their lives or build a business. Either they do not
    have the right ID, which can be solved using a self-sovereign identity, or they
    do not have a credit history, which makes it almost impossible to access banking
    facilities. As a result, they are forced to save in livestock, which is obviously
    not very liquid if essential items such as medicine need to be bought. In addition,
    a transaction fee of US$0.50 on credit card purchases represents almost a third
    of the daily income for extremely poor people who live on US$1.90 a day.

    remittances. Today, over US$410 billion [174] in remittances flow to developing
    countries, with an average cost of 7.4% [175] and up to 12% [176] in certain regions.
    Remittances are expensive, opaque, and recurring transactions of necessity, with
    the costs borne predominantly by poor people [177]. Blockchain can offer enormous
    improvements in cost savings for poor people who send money to families in another
    country. Not surprisingly, there are multiple start-ups and organisations [178],
    including the United Nations, that are developing blockchain-based remittance
    services [179]. A blockchain-based remittance service uses a crypto-coin to transfer
    money instantly across the globe for a fraction of the cost, and uses local agents
    to exchange the crypto-coin into the local fiat money that can be used by the
    receiver. Instead of a transaction taking days to process and costing a fortune,
    it takes minutes and is significantly cheaper (despite the challenge of high transaction
    costs currently linked to Bitcoin, as explained in [Chapter 2](ch0002.xlink.xhtml)).
