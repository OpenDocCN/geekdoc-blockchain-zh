- en: Over the past 100 years, the world has seen an extraordinary growth in welfare.
    Across the board, the world today is in a much better state, economically, than
    it was 100 years ago. Although it may seem that the world is on fire at the moment,
    with ongoing wars in Syria, the Yemeni crisis, or the terrorist threat from ISIS
    that killed thousands of people and left millions fleeing their country, or the
    Mexican Drug war that has killed over 80,000 people since 2006 [142], nothing
    can be further from the truth. On almost all levels, life on earth has improved
    in the past 100 years from our life expectancy, the number of people living in
    democratic countries, to the number of people living in extreme poverty. Thanks
    to significantly improved healthcare, as well as better living and working conditions,
    life expectancy has increased rapidly in the past 100 years, from 34.1 years in
    1913 to 71.4 years in 2015 [143]. In addition, the child mortality rate fell from
    43% of the world’s newborns who would die before their fifth birthday in 1800,
    due to the poor health conditions, to only 4.3% in 2015\. Although 4.3% of all
    newborns who die in childhood is still too high, it is quite an achievement [144].
    Thanks to better food production, the number of famine victims fell drastically
    from 578 global deaths per 100,000 population in the 1950s to 3 global deaths
    per 100,000 population in the 2000s [145]. Also, the number of people living in
    a democracy increased significantly over the past 100 years. In 1900, almost 200
    million people, or 11.97% of the world’s population, lived in a democracy. In
    2015, that number grew to 4.1 billion people, or 55.8% of the world’s population
    [146]. Finally, thanks to technological advancements, global poverty has also
    been reduced significantly in the past 100 years. The percentage of people living
    in extreme poverty^([1](#note1)) [147] dropped from 94.4% in 1820 to 9.6% in 2015
    [147]. This achievement is predominantly attributable to the past three decades,
    because only as recently as 1980 the percentage was still 44% [147]. The third
    industrial revolution, the information age, which started in the 1970s and brought
    us mainframe computing, personal computing, and the internet, has enabled millions
    of people to leave poverty and become connected to the global economy. Unfortunately,
    9.6% of the world’s population still live in extreme poverty—that is, 700 million
    people, which is still 700 million people too many. The vast majority of these
    people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [147]. However, developing countries
    also still experience poverty, which, unfortunately and interestingly, has been
    on the rise in recent years, especially in Europe. The International Labour Organization
    estimated that, in 2012, over 300 million people in developed countries were living
    in poverty [148]. This high number is linked to the wave of refugees who have
    fled to Europe in the past three years [149].

    that cause poverty are also the effects of poverty. For example, when hurricane
    Sandy moved over Haiti in 2012, it displaced over 18,000 people, many of whom
    were still living in UN camps after the devastating earthquake of 2010 [150].
    Those displaced people have to live in poor conditions, directly affecting their
    health. If they become ill, their capacity to work will be negatively impacted
    and, with a lack of a social security system in place, the line to poverty is
    easily crossed. It is often a vicious circle that is difficult to break and the
    effects of poverty are often passed on from one generation to the next. The effects
    of poverty are often interrelated, rarely occurring alone, and are, therefore,
    difficult to solve. Poverty is a true Wicked Problem, which will require the involvement
    of all stakeholders, collaborating with each other, using the latest technologies
    to try to break the vicious circle of poverty. Poverty has an impact on different
    levels within a person’s life or within a country and, to break the vicious circle
    of poverty, each of these aspects should be approached, ideally simultaneously.
    That is what makes this Wicked Problem so difficult to solve.

    nutritious food and water. Whether in developing or developed countries, malnutrition
    as a result of poverty is also a catalyst for poverty. Often, the healthiest and
    most nutritious food is also the most expensive. For these reasons, people with
    small budgets often have less nutritious diets due to their dependence on cheaper
    ‘fast’ food. Thus, their children grow up without the required nutrition, which
    has an impact on their ability to learn, play, and grow. In addition, too much
    fast food results in obesity, with all the associated health consequences. Poverty
    will, therefore, almost always result in severe health effects, whether in developing
    or developed countries. The lack of nutrition and proper medicine, the (easy)
    access to healthcare facilities, or the lack of proper sanitation conditions negatively
    influence people’s life expectancies. In addition, lack of healthcare insurance
    stops people from seeking care because they cannot afford the treatments or medicine,
    thereby making their situation deteriorate. Children who are sick or suffer from
    malnutrition will have difficulty concentrating at school, if they get the chance
    to attend a school at all. In developing countries, many children are sent to
    work as soon as they can stand, in order to earn money for the family. Lack of
    education results in illiteracy, which can haunt them throughout their lives.
    The effect of illiteracy is that they will have difficulty getting a job, resulting
    in rising unemployment rates, uncertainty, and a growing informal economy, which
    limits a government from improving the situation for the country as a whole, due
    to lack of income. Many of the poor people living in informal economies do not
    have a documented identity, thereby limiting them from access to many (government)
    resources and activities. In addition, the rise of robots and automation will
    make things worse in the coming years, reducing even further the number of available
    jobs for those who are uneducated. Consequently, social unrest can develop and
    quickly derail a society. This effect played out during the Arab Spring in early
    2011, where a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions
    spread across the Middle East. The chaos and lawlessness were fuelled by political
    uncertainty and quickly led to increased job insecurity and higher levels of poverty.

    them with sufficient high-quality food, a proper education, knowledge, and skills
    to enable them to realise their full potential. Next to education comes access
    to affordable proper healthcare (including insurance), access to clean water and
    sanitation, and, last but not least, economic security and connecting poor people
    to the (global) economy by offering them an identity, access to banking facilities,
    and the right of ownership. Economic security includes registration of property
    ownership, access to banking facilities, and a fair and transparent rule of law,
    which includes rules that everyone understands and respects. Especially in developing
    countries these three economic securities (property ownership, access to banking
    facilities, and rule of law) are often lacking. As a result, these countries often
    have a large informal economy, which results in less respect for ownership or
    financial and legal rights, making it expensive to abide by the law.

    economy is the part of the economy that is neither taxed nor controlled by any
    form of government. The larger the informal economy, the more insecurity there
    is for citizens, which can result in unrest and poverty. Due to a lack of data,
    determination of the size of the informal economy is difficult. However, Mexico
    determined in 2014 that the informal economy contributed on average 26% to their
    GDP over the decade from 2003 to 2012 [151]. That’s a large chunk of the economy
    that is not controlled or monitored, and therefore affects millions of people.

    high costs of doing business legally. According to research by McKinsey, emerging-market
    businesses face administrative costs three times higher than their counterparts
    in developed economies [152]. In addition, the famous Peruvian economist Hernando
    de Soto Polar, who is a known for his work on the informal economy, views property
    ownership rights being vital for a strong market economy. De Soto argues that,
    without adequate participation in an information framework that records ownership
    of property and other economic information, poverty is difficult to overcome.
    Next to the absence of property rights, the lack of rule of law [153] and of access
    to banking facilities facilitates the growth of an informal economy, because it
    drives up the cost of doing business legally [154].

    Many different organisations try to help poor people, all with the best intentions.
    However, these organisations operate in isolation, each of them having their own
    database with information on the citizens whom they try to help. As a result,
    there is no centralised overview, leaving the person in need without any information
    or credit history that could be used to improve their situation, while requiring
    each organisation to maintain their own database. Thus, being poor is often very
    expensive, resulting in a negative vicious circle and an increase in poverty in

    Youth Empowerment Center resulted in a plug-and-play model for agriculture, developing
    self-sustaining, smart, modified shipping containers for agriculture. The ‘Farm

    performances and act accordingly, and create a single view of the healthcare organisation

    system satisfies regulatory requirements for protection of patient data, but is

    will create a new patient record that will include a variety of personalised identifiable
    information such as name, address, age, height, weight, blood type, and perhaps
    even a DNA sample. All the information will be tokenised, encrypted, and stored

    3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml). Using a centralised storage system, as is common these
    days, would not be sufficient, because it would take away control of the data
    from the patient. Only the patient and the doctor will be able to view any patient-specific
    data and, if another doctor or organisation needs to get access to the data for
    health reasons, the patient can release only information that is required, cryptographically,

    in the supply chain is paid a lot sooner than is currently the case. The patient
    uses the medicine and will report any progress back to the doctor, which will
    be added to the Electronic Health Record on the blockchain. In cases of more severe
    health problems or when a patient needs to be transported to hospital, the advantage
    is that the hospital has access to all the records of the patients, including
    any medicines that have been delivered by drone, and so can develop a better treatment

    technology by securely (tokenising and encrypting) storing any patient data on
    a blockchain, and giving full control to the patient who has access to that data,
    while at the same time preserving any private information about the patient (as
    mentioned, any personal data such as biometrics or DNA should never be put as
    is on a blockchain). Blockchain technology, or more specifically a self-sovereign
    healthcare identity system, would give patients and doctors all the advantages
    of digital records while ensuring privacy for the patient. Of course, any company
    dealing with health data on blockchain should ensure privacy for its users by
    giving full control to the user and ensuring that data remains private. This could
    be achieved, for example, by using Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). ZKP ensures that
    data can be shared without leaking personal information and one party can prove
    a certain fact without revealing that information. However, giving full control
    of healthcare data to the patient also creates a significant challenge, because,
    as discussed in [Chapter 3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml), the Public Key Infrastructure
    is an important aspect of this. Loss of the private key would cause problems for
    the patient to remain in full control. Therefore, any start-up working in this
    field should offer solutions for when individuals lose, for whatever reason, access

    is the prevention of unauthorised and fraudulent changes to data records. As such,
    blockchain technology is perfectly suited to register ownership of property, of
    anything digital and non-digital. It will protect the rights of the owner (in
    the case of theft), enable easy resolution of disputes, enable correct transfer
    of ownership after sale, and prevent fraud, because any records are immutable,
    verifiable, and traceable.

    that is transparent, enables easy registration, and respects land ownership. Registering

    offers people more freedom to save and spend money how, where, and when they like.
    Unfortunately, for poor people it has become very difficult to open a bank account
    and/or get a loan to improve their lives or build a business. Either they do not
    have the right ID, which can be solved using a self-sovereign identity, or they
    do not have a credit history, which makes it almost impossible to access banking
    facilities. As a result, they are forced to save in livestock, which is obviously
    not very liquid if essential items such as medicine need to be bought. In addition,
    a transaction fee of US$0.50 on credit card purchases represents almost a third
    of the daily income for extremely poor people who live on US$1.90 a day.

    see with Bitcoin. Bitcoin enables everyone with an internet connection to open
    a wallet and start receiving and sending money, without the need for an ID or
    a credit history. For many developing countries, this might be nothing new. They
    have been using pre-paid mobile phone minutes as a currency for years. Mobile
    airtime minutes, or credits, can be transferred between phones or dealers, or
    shown to owners to purchase or barter for goods and services [173]. This is similar
    to tokens or crypto-coins on a blockchain, albeit less secure and more open to
    fraud.

    products and services for poor people, for a fraction of the cost, which could

    developed a bitcoin-lending platform, which is gaining power in Latin America.
    They offer multiple loan services, including cash advances, peer-to-peer loans,
    and business loans, using the bitcoin blockchain for a much lower rate than traditional

    remittances. Today, over US$410 billion [174] in remittances flow to developing
    countries, with an average cost of 7.4% [175] and up to 12% [176] in certain regions.
    Remittances are expensive, opaque, and recurring transactions of necessity, with
    the costs borne predominantly by poor people [177]. Blockchain can offer enormous
    improvements in cost savings for poor people who send money to families in another
    country. Not surprisingly, there are multiple start-ups and organisations [178],
    including the United Nations, that are developing blockchain-based remittance
    services [179]. A blockchain-based remittance service uses a crypto-coin to transfer
    money instantly across the globe for a fraction of the cost, and uses local agents
    to exchange the crypto-coin into the local fiat money that can be used by the
    receiver. Instead of a transaction taking days to process and costing a fortune,
    it takes minutes and is significantly cheaper (despite the challenge of high transaction
    costs currently linked to Bitcoin, as explained in [Chapter 2](ch0002.xlink.xhtml)).

    the delivery of financial products to poorer customers. Use of the property owned
    by individuals or the combined wealth of groups of borrowers as collateral can
    make the provision of credit more widely available, more competitive, and therefore
    cheaper. These mechanisms ensure that lending is available to a greater percentage
    of the community. Smart contracts can also automate repayments, thereby reducing
    the risk of contractual disputes [180, p. 15].

    and the citizens know the law and obey it [181]. Rule of law is the principle

    government officials. Therefore, a lack of rule of law will increase the informal

    Already, Blockchain is having a profound impact on the legal industry and lawyers

    use Boolean expressions and algorithmic determination to perform certain actions.
    Smart contracts automatically execute when a predefined condition is met and,
    as a result, cannot be ignored. All too often contracts are simply ignored, payments
    delayed or bluntly refused, and disputes need to be resolved in court, costing
    a lot of time and money for the parties involved. Smart contracts, if developed
    correctly and securely, could prevent this, because the contract will automatically
    execute only once certain pre-set conditions have been met. As such, it becomes
    easier for organisations and citizens to obey the law and abide by agreements
    that have been made, making it cheaper to play by the rules and reducing the informal
    economy.

    The combination can be used to obtain a loan, instantly, through a blockchain-powered
    financial institution at very low cost, which will enable poor people to improve
    their lives and create or grow their business. With the right smart contracts,
    rule of law can be enforced automatically, thereby reducing the cost of doing
    business legally and reducing the number of informal economies. This could improve
    government regulation and increase tax received, which in turn could improve the
    stability and economy of a country. Blockchain can truly be a paradigm shift for
    poor people because it offers them the opportunity to improve their lives, monetise
    their (digital) capital and leave poverty behind.
