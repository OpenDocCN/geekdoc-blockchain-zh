    from economic crime every year; the number is 37 percent for the entire economy
    and only 20 percent and 27 percent for the professional services and technology

    tokens for the new cryptocurrency are sold to raise money for technical development
    before the cryptocurrency is released. Unlike an initial public offering (IPO)
    , acquisition of tokens does not grant ownership in the company developing the
    new cryptocurrency. Unlike an IPO, there is no (comprehensive) government regulation
    of an ICO.[⁶](#Fn6)ICOs and new funding models using distributed ledger methodologies
    are starting to disrupt both public markets (IPOs) and private investments (venture
    capital). An article from Coin Desk illustrated the blockchain’s impact on venture
    capital formation. Coin Desk further noted, “There is proven demand and interest
    from both the entrepreneurial and investor audiences and limited regulatory guidance.
    ICOs could continue to gain steam as a funding mechanism.”[⁷](#Fn7)“Initial Coin
    Offerings (ICOs) are changing the cryptocurrency markets in rapid and expanding

    who are backed by blockchain-fueled ideas,” stated Harvard Business Review writer
    Richard Kastelein.[⁸](#Fn8)ICOs are dominating the overall crowdfunding charts
    in terms of funds raised, with half of the top 20 raises coming from the crypto
    community. The companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq, and Intercontinental
    Exchange, the U.S. holding company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, which

    but it can be fiat money as well. As a result the company gets the capital to

    money, or different digital currencies. They can be market measures that typically
    take the bid–ask spreads as transaction commissions for their services or simply
    charge fees as a matching platform.[^(13)](#Fn13)Typically DCEs operate outside
    of Western countries, avoiding regulatory oversight and complicating prosecutions.
    A U.S.-based global Bitcoin exchange named Kracken is located in San Francisco.

    in Euro volume and liquidity. Poloniex is described on its web site as a U.S.-based
    digital asset exchange offering maximum security and advanced trading features.As
    one works with DCEs and for all aspects of operating in the world, it is very
    important to establish identity easily and exactly. The future of identity management
    looks different with blockchain technology in a decentralized digital world. Digital
    identity networks built on blockchain drives trust among businesses as a social
    enterprise by leveraging shared ledgers, smart contracts, and governance to standardized
    management, at the same time reducing the cost, risk, time, and complexity of

- en: 'At this time, Coin Desk discusses the state of ICO regulation with a focus
    on legal status in six nations. Several points of interest are quoted by a recent
    report from Autonomous Next, a FinTech and research firm. The report considers
    Switzerland and Singapore to be the two most advanced nations for creating welcoming
    environments for FinTech and cryptocurrencies . In Switzerland, the law is that
    cryptocurrencies are assets rather than securities. The same is true for Singapore.
    The Singapore MAS authority does not regulate virtual currency transactions, but
    does monitor KYC and AML, the report states.The report singled out the United
    Kingdom and United States as jurisdictions with high activity, but a lack of legal
    clarity. The United States, with many regulatory groups and 50 states that implement
    rules, makes the process of regulation more complex. The state of Delaware has
    recently passed blockchain-related legislation. In China, tokens are considered
    a nonmonetary digital asset. Russia has been welcoming of cryptocurrencies. Cryptotokens
    are categorized as legal financial instruments similar to derivatives.[^(14)](#Fn14)Smith
    & Crown stated a significant problem in the legal status of token sales still
    being in question. Participants in token sales might not enjoy the same legal
    status or protections as investors in private and public equity sales. Uncapped
    token sale raises and structures that allow projects to raise large sums of capital
    while retaining majority control over their token economy could exacerbate this
    problem by drawing attention from regulatory agencies. A number of countries are
    actively exploring new regulatory frameworks for token sales, and several groups,
    including Smith & Crown, are developing guidelines for best practices and self-regulation.[^(15)](#Fn15)The
    current regulation status is that the SEC in the United States issued a letter
    stating that ICOs , cryptocurrencies , and related matters are viewed by the SEC
    as securities. As stated previously, this brings some clarity to the marketplace
    on this issue. Although some will read it positively and others negatively, ultimately
    the SEC statement set in motion an entirely new understanding of the regulatory
    environment both in the United States and globally.A Securities Law Framework
    for Blockchain Tokens describes multiple key thoughts and actions for anyone that
    is interested in blockchain tokens. “The Framework focuses on US federal securities
    laws because these laws pose the biggest risk for crowd sales of blockchain tokens.
    In many jurisdictions, there may also be issues under anti-money laundering laws
    and general consumer protection laws, as well as, specific laws depending on what
    the token actually does.” The Howey Test establishes the test for whether an investment
    contract is a security (SEC v. Howey).[^(16)](#Fn16)The framework illustrates

- en: Deloitte, in collaboration with Irish Funds and their members, advanced “Project
    Lighthouse” to assess blockchain technology’s ability to service regulatory reporting
    requirements. The project tested the ability for a platform to provide individual
    nodes for fund administrators to store and analyze fund data while coding regulatory
    reporting requirements into smart contracts for execution and data validation.
    A regulator node was also facilitated, allowing the safe and secure exchange of
    data between firms and the regulator, as well as to increase overall reporting
    efficiency and market transparency. In addition to technical design and development,
    a comparative business analysis was undertaken to review the cost–benefit analysis
    of the proposed blockchain solution.RegChain was developed using Deloitte’s rapid
    prototyping process, which uses an experiment-driven agile methodology. Key phrases
    included solution visioning definition of design and test parameters, development
    sprints, and ongoing reviews with an industry subcommittee with participants from
    across the fund administrator and fund management world .A key consideration and
    cornerstone for this project was to ensure collaboration among technologists and
    industry representatives from operations, regulatory teams, and senior management.
    This was deemed critical in order to have a comprehensive PoC design, and moreover,
    to help define how a future production solution could be realized. [^(20)](#Fn20)

    to protect backers from failed projects—guaranteeing their investment with blockchain

    for automated and independent ICOs, pre-ICOs, and crowdfunding campaigns built
    on Ethereum and funded by cryptocurrencies. The purpose of KICKCO is to solve
