    Punjab, IndiaOnce upon a time, computers were as big as rooms. They were capable
    of complex mathematical calculations. They were not, though, meant to be operated
    by people like me and you. Nor were they designed for creating documents and presentations,
    playing games, or surfing the web. Early computers were powered by vacuum tubes—just
    like most other sophisticated electronic devices of the time—and were used in
    scientific research. Then, the semiconductor revolution happened, and the transistor
    was born.NoteA vacuum tube is an electronic device that was a common component
    in old radio and television sets, amplifiers, and even computers. The tube is
    a glass enclosure that houses an anode and a cathode inside a vacuum (no air or
    gas). It’s based on the principle that electric current can move through vacuum
    and does not need solid material for the purpose. The first vacuum tube was a
    diode that, unlike semi-conductor diodes of today, was large and fragile.Transistors
    gave birth to microprocessors, and microprocessors eventually brought computers
    into our homes and allowed them to do much more than just record scientific data,
    crunch numbers, or break codes. The first IBM personal computer was powered by
    an Intel 8088 chip, which ran at a “blazing” speed of 4.77MHz. Processors soon
    went through a revolution of their own, one dictated by the famous Moore’s Law.
    The processing power of computers roughly doubled every 18 months, allowing them
    to do tasks that could not be efficiently done on previous generation processors.What
    is the common pattern here? All these revolutions have affected not just the performance
    or software development methods but also computing in general, in a way unimaginable
    before.There have been other such historic revolutions—in parallel and subsequent—that
    have changed computing forever. Take a recent phenomenon for instance: the Cloud
    revolution. Back in 2010, when “cloud” was just a buzzword in newspapers and magazines,
    there was widespread confusion about the true meaning of cloud. Everyone talked
    about the disruptive potential and lasting benefits of Cloud, but only pockets
    of technology-savvy people actually understood it. A few years later everyone
    had adopted it. Cloud has affected not just businesses by offering entirely new
    business models to run their companies on but also affected our personal lives.
    Today, we cannot begin to imagine a world without Cloud: a world without online
    storage, unlimited music and video streaming, photo sharing, collaborative document
    editing, and social networking at the speed of light. Businesses have saved millions
    of dollars by basing the better part of their infrastructure on Cloud services
    rather than bearing steep costs of managing in-house networks of servers.Cloud
    went on to become a key enabler of the Big Data revolution. Cloud computing gave
    us enough power to analyze billions of records, worth terabytes of data, exponentially
    quicker, and at considerably lower costs.Let’s try to understand the role of Cloud
    through an example. Consider an e-commerce website, say Amazon.com. At a high
    level, it stores two types of data about its users—transactional and non-transactional.
    Non-transactional data is information about customers (name, email, or address),
    items (name, price, discount, or seller), etc. Transactional data, on the other
    hand, is information about a particular transaction on the website, e.g., buying
    an item, submitting a product review, adding an item to wishlist or cart, etc.
    This type of data grows at a rapid pace on sites like Amazon. On Prime Day 2016,
    Amazon recorded sales of close to 600 items per second. That is 2.1 million items
    in one hour alone!Storing such gigantic data was once prohibitively expensive,
    forcing companies to archive or remove transactional data after a set retention
    period (a few weeks to a couple of years). The potent combination of Cloud and
    Big Data technologies has not only enabled us to store (rather than throwing away)
    huge amounts of historic data at dirt cheap prices, but it has also allowed us
    to leverage the archived data to perform complex data analytics tasks over years’
    worth of data to derive meaningful statistics and graphs for customer behavior
    and buying trends—what were the top selling hundred items in each category during
    peak hours on sale day; which items were popular among users in terms of viewing
    but not in terms of buying?Almost simultaneously came the IoT revolution. As with
    Big Data, Cloud is a key enabler of this revolution. Powered by a variety of sensors,
    IoT devices generate so much data that Big Data technologies usually go hand-in-hand
    with IoT. Cloud provides both storage and computing power to the otherwise lightweight
    devices on an IoT network. After helping spark two big revolutions, Cloud did
    it again with Artificial Intelligence (AI).AI has surfaced and resurfaced in several
    waves, but it’s only recently that it has become commonplace. The widespread affordability
    and use of AI in software development has been seen as a revolution. The first
    AI revolution, the one we are currently witnessing, is about AI-as-a-Service.
    The book Artificial Intelligence for .NET: Speech, Language, and Search (Apress,
    2017) gives an in-depth of creating AI-enabled software applications. With advancements
    in IoT and the emergence of Blockchain, AI is on brink of a second revolution,
    one that involves creating complete product offerings with intelligent software
    and custom hardware.NoteThe “as a service” model is generally associated with
    Cloud infrastructure, and that is true here as well. World’s top tech companies—Google,
    IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon—are offering AI services, in the form of SDKs and RESTful
    APIs, that help developers add intelligence to their software applications. Let’s
    understand this in a little more detail.Let’s explore each component of the upcoming
    AI 2.0 revolution in detail.'

    8088芯片驱动的，速度为“令人眼花缭乱”的4.77MHz。处理器很快经历了自己的革命，这是由著名的摩尔定律所决定的。计算机的处理能力大约每18个月翻一番，使它们能够执行以前一代处理器无法高效完成的任务。这里的共同模式是什么？所有这些革命都不仅影响了性能或软件开发方法，而且在以前是无法想象的情况下也影响了计算。还有其他一些历史性的、与此同时和随后发生的革命，它们彻底改变了计算机的面貌。以最近的现象为例：云革命。回到2010年，当“云”只是报纸和杂志中的一个流行词时，人们对云的真正含义普遍感到困惑。每个人都谈论着云的颠覆性潜力和持久的好处，但只有一小部分技术精通的人真正理解它。几年后，每个人都采用了它。云不仅通过提供全新的商业模式来影响企业，而且影响了我们的个人生活。今天，我们无法想象一个没有云的世界：一个没有在线存储、无限音乐和视频流、照片共享、协作文档编辑和光速社交网络的世界。企业通过基于云服务的更好的基础设施而不是承担管理内部服务器网络的高昂成本，节省了数百万美元。云随后成为大数据革命的关键推动者。云计算赋予了我们足够的能力来更快、更廉价地分析数十亿条记录，价值几个字节的数据。让我们试着通过一个例子来理解云的作用。考虑一个电子商务网站，比如Amazon.com。在高层次上，它存储着关于其用户的两种类型的数据——交易和非交易。非交易数据是关于顾客（姓名、电子邮件或地址）、商品（名称、价格、折扣或卖家）等信息。另一方面，交易数据是关于网站上的特定交易的信息，例如购买商品、提交产品评论、添加商品到愿望清单或购物车等等。这种类型的数据在像Amazon这样的网站上迅速增长。在2016年的Prime
    Day上，亚马逊每秒销售接近600件商品。那就是仅仅一个小时内的210万件商品！存储如此庞大的数据曾经是价格高昂的，迫使公司在一定的保留期限后（几周到几年）将交易数据归档或删除。云和大数据技术的强大组合不仅使我们能够以极其便宜的价格存储（而不是丢弃）海量历史数据，而且还使我们能够利用已归档的数据执行复杂的数据分析任务，以从几年的数据中推导出有意义的统计数据和图表，了解客户行为和购买趋势——在销售高峰期的每个类别中，哪些商品是畅销的一百种？哪些商品在用户观看方面受欢迎但在购买方面不受欢迎？几乎同时出现了物联网革命。与大数据一样，云是这一革命的关键推动者。由各种传感器驱动，物联网设备产生了如此之多的数据，以至于大

    research. The basic concepts of AI have not changed, but its applications have.
    How AI was perceived in the 1950s is very different from how it’s actually being
    put to use today. And it’s still evolving.Artificial intelligence is a hot topic
    these days. It has come a long way from the pages of popular science fiction books
    to becoming a commodity. And, no, AI has nothing to do with superior robots taking
    over the world and enslaving us humans. At least, not yet. Anything intelligent

    search engine (Google and Bing) to your favorite mobile app or video game, is
    powered by AI. Figure [1-1](#Fig1) shows an AI-powered intelligent chatbot.![A458845_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-1An intelligent chatbot that can place pizza orders by humanly understanding
    its usersInterest in AI peaked during the 2000s, especially at the start of 2010s.
    Huge investments were made in AI research by both academia and corporations, investments
    that have not only affected these institutions but also its affiliates and users.
    For software developers, this has been nothing short of a boon. Advances made
    by companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon in various fields
    of AI, and the subsequent open-sourcing and commercialization of their products,
    has enabled software developers to create human-like experiences in their apps
    with unprecedented ease. This has resulted in an explosion of smart, intelligent
    apps that can understand their users just as a normal human would.Have you, as
    a developer, ever thought about how you can use AI to create insanely smart software?
    You probably have, but did not know where to start.Like all humans, developers
    have pre-conceived notions about products and technologies. In our experience
    with software developers at top IT companies, a common perception that we’ve found
    among both developers and project managers is that adding AI capabilities, such
    as natural language understanding, speech recognition, machine learning, etc.,
    to their software would require a deep understanding of neural networks, fuzzy
    logic, and other mind-bending computer science theories. Well, let us tell you
    the good news. That is not the case anymore.The intelligence that powers your
    favorite applications, like Google search, Bing, Cortana, and Facebook, is slowly

  zh: AI在过去
- en: 'The term “artificial intelligence” was coined at a conference on the campus
    of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956\. The proposal for the conference included
    this assertion: “Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence
    can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” It was
    during this conference that the field of AI research was established, and the
    people who attended it became the pioneers of AI research.During the decades that
    followed, there were major breakthroughs in the field of AI. Computer programs
    were developed to solve algebra problems, prove theorems, and speak English. Government
    agencies and private organizations poured in funds to fuel the research. But the
    road to modern AI was not easy.The first setback to AI research came in 1974\.
    The time between that year and 1980 is known as the first “AI Winter.” During
    this time, a lot of promised results of the research failed to materialize. This
    was due to a combination of factors, the foremost one being the failure of scientists
    to anticipate the difficulty of the problems that AI posed. The limited computing
    power of the time was another major reason. As a result, a lack of progress led
    the major British and American agencies that were earlier supporting the research
    to cut off their funding.The next seven years, 1980-87, saw a renewed interest
    in AI research. The development of expert systems fueled the boom. Expert systems
    are rule engines designed for specific domains; they are fed with a set of logical
    rules derived from the knowledge of experts; decisions are calculated for each
    input using the fed rules. They were getting developed across organizations, and
    soon all big giants started investing huge amount of money in artificial intelligence.
    Work on neural networks laid the foundation for the development of optical character
    recognition and speech recognition techniques. The following years formed the
    second AI Winter, which lasted from 1987 to 1993\. Like the previous winter, AI
    again suffered financial setbacks.1993-2001 marked the return of AI, propelled
    in part by faster and cheaper computers. Finally, older promises of AI research
    were realized because of access to faster computing power, the lack of which had
    started the first winter. Specialized computers were created using advanced AI
    techniques to beat humans. Who can forget the iconic match between IBM’s Deep
    Blue computer and the then reigning chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997?AI was
    extensively used in the field of robotics. The Japanese built robots that looked
    like humans and even understood and spoke human languages. The western world wasn’t
    far behind, and soon there was a race to build the most human-like mechanical
    assistant to man. Honda’s ASIMO is a brilliant example of what could be achieved
    by combining robotics with AI: a 4’3” tall humanoid that can walk, dance, make
    coffee, and even conduct orchestras.'

    Watson, which started as a computer system designed to compete with humans on
    the popular American TV show “Jeopardy!”. In an exhibition match in 2011, Watson
    beat two former winners to clinch the $1 million prize money. Propelled by Watson’s
    success, IBM soon released the AI technologies that powered its computer system

    This term is best explained by the help of an example.Microsoft Bing, the popular
    search engine from Microsoft, can not only perform keyword-based searches but
    also search the Web based on the intended meaning of your search phrase. So doing
    a simple keyword search like “Taylor Swift” will give you the official website,
    Wikipedia page, social media accounts, recent news stories, and some photos of
    the popular American singer-songwriter. Doing a more complex search like “Who
    is the president of Uganda?” will give you the exact name in a large font and
    top web results for that person. It’s like asking a question of another human,
    who knows you do not mean to get all web pages that contain the phrase “Who is
    the president of Uganda,” just the name of the person in question.In both examples
    (Taylor Swift and President of Uganda), Bing will also show, on the left, some
    quick facts about the person: date of birth, spouse, children, etc. And depending
    on the type of person searched, Bing will also show other relevant details, such
    as education, timeline, and quotes for a politician, and net worth, compositions,
    and romances for a singer. How is Bing able to show you so much about a person?
    Have Bing’s developers created a mega-database of quick facts for all the famous
    people in the world (current and past)? Not quite.Although it is not humanly impossible
    to create such a database, the cost of maintaining it would be huge. Our big,
    big world, with so many countries and territories, will keep on producing famous
    people. So there’s a definite scalability problem with this database.The technique
    Microsoft used to solve this problem is called machine learning. We look at machine
    learning in a bit. Similarly, the thing that enables Bing to understand the meaning
    of a search phrase is natural language understanding (NLU). You can ask the same
    question of Bing in a dozen different ways and Bing will still arrive at the same
    meaning every time. NLU makes it smart enough to interpret human languages in

- en: 'The term machine learning was coined by Arthur Samuel in his 1959 paper “Some
    Studies in Machine Learning.” As per Samuel, machine learning is what “gives computers
    the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. We all know a computer
    as a machine that performs certain operations by following instructions supplied
    by humans in the form of programs. So how is it possible for a machine to learn
    something by itself?Machine learning is the very fundamental concept of artificial
    intelligence. ML explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn
    from data and make predictions based on their learning. ML is what powers an intelligent
    machine; it is what generates artificial intelligence.A regular, non-ML language
    translation algorithm would have static program instructions to detect which language
    a sentence is written in: words used, grammatical structure, etc. Similarly, a
    non-ML face detection algorithm would have a hard-coded definition of a face:
    something round, skin colored, having two small dark regions near the top (eyes),
    etc. An ML algorithm, on the other hand, doesn’t have such hard-coding; it learns
    by examples. If you train it with lots of sentences that are written in French
    and some more that are not written in French, it will learn to identify French
    sentences when it sees them. Figure [1-2](#Fig2) shows how an ML algorithm iteratively
    uses sample data to create a trained model that can make predictions based on
    new inputs.![A458845_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-2Large amounts of training data are supplied to an ML algorithm  , such as a
    neural network, to create what is called a “trained model”. A trained model can
    then be used to quickly make predictions against the specified input data.A lot
    of real-world problems are nonlinear, such as language translation, weather prediction,
    email spam filtering, predicting the next president of the United States, classification
    problems (such as telling apart species of birds through images), and so on. ML  is
    an ideal solution for such nonlinear problems where designing and programming
    explicit algorithms using static program instructions is simply not feasible.'

  zh: 术语机器学习是由阿瑟·塞缪尔在他1959年的论文《机器学习研究》中首次提出的。根据塞缪尔的说法，机器学习是指“使计算机具有学习能力而无需明确编程”。我们都知道，计算机是一种通过按照人类以程序形式提供的指令执行某些操作的机器。那么计算机如何能够自己学习呢？机器学习是人工智能的非常基本的概念。ML
    探索了能够从数据中学习并基于其学习进行预测的算法的研究和构建。ML 是智能机器的动力；它是生成人工智能的原因。常规的非 ML 语言翻译算法将具有静态程序指令来检测句子是用哪种语言编写的：使用的单词、语法结构等。同样，非
    ML 人脸检测算法将具有面部的硬编码定义：一些圆形的、肤色的，顶部有两个小黑区域（眼睛）等。另一方面，ML 算法没有这样的硬编码；它通过示例学习。如果你用大量用法语写的句子和一些不是法语的句子来训练它，它将学会在看到它们时识别法语句子。图[1-2](#Fig2)显示了
    ML 算法如何迭代地使用示例数据创建一个可以根据新输入进行预测的训练模型。![A458845_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)图1-2大量的训练数据被提供给
    ML 算法，比如神经网络，以创建所谓的“训练模型”。然后可以使用训练模型来快速针对指定的输入数据进行预测。许多现实世界的问题是非线性的，比如语言翻译、天气预测、电子邮件垃圾邮件过滤、预测下一任美国总统、分类问题（比如通过图像区分鸟类物种）等等。ML
    是这种非线性问题的理想解决方案，其中设计和编程使用静态程序指令的明确算法根本不可行。

- en: 'We know now how precious ML is for solving nonlinear problems. Technically,
    AI is seen as a wide research area whose goal is to explore fields of computer
    science and to create technologies to lend machines human-like intelligence. One
    major field of AI—and the one used the most—is natural language processing or
    NLP. It is an umbrella term that is used to represent various related and independent
    tasks related to processing natural languages, languages that humans speak. Understanding
    the basic communication medium of humans is the foundation of intelligence in
    our world, is it not? Among the various NLP tasks are language understanding (NLU),
    machine translation (language translation), speech recognition (speech to text),
    etc.Another major field of AI is computer vision (CV), the field that deals with
    making machines intelligent enough to interpret visuals (images and videos) the
    way humans do. Some common CV tasks include face detection and recognition, object
    detection and recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), image classification,
    etc.Each of the NLP and CV  tasks is a nonlinear problem that can be solved through
    machine learning. In technical terms, we can create machine learning models for
    each of them using sufficiently large amounts of training data (usually in gigabytes).
    Creating one ML model, let alone all, is intellectually challenging and expensive.
    Even if you have a team of computer science and math people armed with ML skills,
    there’s the cost of extremely expensive hardware to take care of to develop those
    models. It may take up to 2-3 months to accurately train an ML model on high-end
    machines running 24x7, using the currently available deep learning toolkits such
    as Microsoft CNTK, Google Tensorflow, and Torch. Although specialized ML-friendly
    microprocessors are being developed (iPhone’s A11 Bionic and Google’s TPU) and
    hardware costs are coming down further, it’s still exponentially easier and cheaper
    to use commercially available AI services.AI services—such as Microsoft’s Cognitive
    Services APIs—can be used in virtually any code to incrementally add intelligence.

    use cases are not cumbersome to implement anymore:'

  zh: 我们现在知道机器学习在解决非线性问题时有多么珍贵。从技术上讲，人工智能被视为一个广泛的研究领域，其目标是探索计算机科学领域，并创造出赋予机器类似人类智能的技术。人工智能的一个主要领域——也是最常用的领域——是自然语言处理或NLP。它是一个代表了与处理人类所说自然语言相关的各种任务的大伞术语。理解人类的基本交流媒介不就是我们世界中智能的基础吗？在各种NLP任务中，包括语言理解（NLU）、机器翻译（语言翻译）、语音识别（语音转文本）等等。人工智能的另一个主要领域是计算机视觉（CV），这个领域涉及使机器智能到足以像人类一样解释视觉（图像和视频）。一些常见的CV任务包括人脸检测和识别、物体检测和识别、光学字符识别（OCR）、图像分类等。NLP和CV中的每一个任务都是可以通过机器学习解决的非线性问题。从技术上讲，我们可以使用足够大量的训练数据（通常以千兆字节计）为它们中的每一个创建机器学习模型。创建一个ML模型，更别说全部，都是在智力上具有挑战性和昂贵的。即使你有一支具备ML技能的计算机科学和数学团队，也要照顾到开发这些模型所需的极度昂贵的硬件成本。即使使用目前可用的深度学习工具包如Microsoft
    CNTK、Google Tensorflow和Torch，在24x7地运行在高端机器上进行准确训练一个ML模型可能需要2-3个月的时间。虽然专门的ML友好微处理器正在研发中（如iPhone的A11仿生和Google的TPU），硬件成本进一步下降，但使用商业可用的人工智能服务仍然成本指数级地更容易更便宜。人工智能服务——比如Microsoft的认知服务API——可以被几乎任何代码使用来逐步增加智能。这个任务已经被简化为几次REST

- en: The Internet of Things is a routinely misunderstood term. In fact, Internet
    itself is highly misunderstood, let alone “things?” So, what is the Internet and
    what are the things? And more importantly, how are things connected to the Internet
    (and each other)?The Internet was invented to connect two computers, sitting in
    two different parts of the world, with each other. It was not invented, as is
    a common misconception, to help you browse websites. Sometimes, the terms Internet
    and WWW (world wide web or just Web) are used interchangeably. This is a dangerous
    error. They are not the same. It’s like saying that Facebook and status updates
    are the same thing, which they are not because updating status is just one part
    of Facebook among dozens of other features, such as photos, apps, games, check-ins,
    etc.Using the same analogy, Web is just one aspect of the Internet. It is Internet,
    and not Web, that allows you to check emails, watch videos, send IM messages,
    make video calls, and a hundred other things. Each of the Internet’s “functionalities”
    is supported by a different protocol. Web uses HTTP, email uses IMAP/SMTP, video
    streaming uses RTSP, instant messaging uses Jabber, video calling uses VoIP, and
    so on. So, the next time you hear somebody say, “check the latest prices for this
    product on the Internet,” interrupt them politely by pointing out that they actually
    meant Web and not Internet.During its initial days, the Internet was composed
    only of computers, which were large and bulky (although not big-as-room bulky).
    Back then, the Internet connected computers with servers or with each other. There
    were few or no other devices that could be connected to the Internet. This changed
    with the introduction of smartphones. They were tiny, pocket-sized computers that
    could be connected to the Internet. While on Internet, they could do most things
    a regular computer could—browse websites, check email, send IM, etc. Then came
    tablets. And then, smart TVs. After that, smartwatches. You have probably witnessed
    the trend yourself. We even have smart thermostats, fridges, printers, cameras,
    music systems, cars, toasters (!), and so on. In other words, our Internet now
    has millions of these non-computer items connected to it (see Figure [1-4](#Fig4)).
    These non-computer items are the “things” in IoT. Each thing is individually called
    an IoT device.![A458845_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.jpg)Figure

    to buy car insurance before taking your new car out on the road. This is not just
    to protect your car against damages but also to provide for medical costs for
    a person who may get injured in an accident because of your driving. Anyway, let’s
    say you are a careful driver and even after a year of driving your new car you
    haven’t injured anyone. Then one fateful day, you were driving carefully as usual
    when another car comes speeding from nowhere and hits your car from the side.
    You are devastated. You had kept your car like new for all that time. And now,
    because of no fault of your own, your precious car has a dent as deep as a black
    hole.To make things worse, when you submit your claim, get bogged down by a complicated
    claims process and are eventually paid unfairly. The insurer says that they weren’t
    able to access whether the damage was the other guy’s fault or your own.Cases
    like this happen by the thousands on a daily basis around the world. Blockchain
    is the revolution that can change this forever. Not only do customers benefit
    but so do the insurers. Before you see how, let’s first understand what Blockchain
    is.

  zh: 什么是区块链？
- en: 'In the simplest of words, Blockchain is a document full of entries that are
    shared with a group of people and organizations. The entries can be anything related
    to people/organizations within the sharing group: items owned, money sent/received,
    items sold/bought, etc. For security purposes, the shared document is encrypted
    and verified to ensure the data it stores is always correct (true to everyone).
    As everyone in the group has access to the exact same entries, there is no need
    for a central authority—a bank, the police, a judge, or any other arbitrator—to
    validate a transaction between two people in the group. Everyone knows about the
    said transaction that occurred between those two people. Also, the entries are
    immutable: once created, they cannot be updated or deleted. They cannot be tampered
    with!In slightly more technical terms, Blockchain is a decentralized network—as
    seen in Figure [1-5](#Fig5)—where each transaction involving two or more members
    on the network is recorded on a block in a giant write-once ledger. Think of a
    block as a page in the ledger. In this sense, a ledger can be thought of as a
    chain of blocks. Everyone in the network has the same copy of the ledger. Each
    time a transaction takes place, it is added to the ledgers of the members involved.
    Then, quickly and securely, all other copies of the ledger on the network are
    updated to ensure that all copies are kept in sync. There is no “master” ledger.
    There are as many ledgers as there are members on the network.![A458845_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.jpg)Figure

- en: 'You may have heard about Blockchain in the context of the popular cryptocurrency
    Bitcoin  . The precursor to Blockchain was first described by Stuart Haber and
    W. Scott Stornetta, as early as 1991, in their paper “How to Time-Stamp a Digital
    Document,” published in the Journal of Cryptography. It was only in 2008 that
    the modern idea of Blockchain—or block chain, as it was originally called—was
    presented in the famous paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”
    by Satoshi Nakamoto published at [metzdowd.com](http://metzdowd.com) . Blockchain
    was described as the backend infrastructure on which the Bitcoin would work.NoteNo
    one really knows who invented Bitcoin and wrote the paper on it. Satoshi Nakamoto
    is a pseudonym used by an unknown person or a group of persons that invented Bitcoin,
    implemented the first Blockchain, and released the open source Bitcoin software.
    There have been multiple attempts to find the real identity of Nakamoto, including
    involvements from American agencies such as Department of Homeland Security and
    NSA. While some sources claim to have found the real person(s) behind the mysterious
    pseudonym, there is no consensus. To this day, Nakamoto remains a hidden figure
    potentially worth billions of U.S. dollars because of his or her initial stock
    of Bitcoins.Bitcoin  is a virtual, electronic currency. It is not issued by a
    bank, and no government or authority in the world endorses it. There are no official
    Bitcoin currency notes and physical coins. So, how does it work? Why does it have
    credibility? Let’s see. We learned in Blockchain’s simpler definition that it
    can be thought of as a big shared database of transactions. In the case of Bitcoin,
    its Blockchain network started off with a small amount of coins (money). These
    coins were then distributed among the network’s members. New coins can be introduced
    into the chain through a time- and resource-intensive process, aka Bitcoin mining.
    Each time coins are redistributed or added, a transaction is securely recorded
    in the Blockchain’s ledgers. So, if Person A gives Person B a certain amount of
    money, the transaction is replicated at each and every ledger. In effect, everyone
    on the network knows that Person A has given x money worth coins to Person B.
    As everyone knows about this transaction, there is no dispute. Person B cannot
    lie about getting money less than x, and Person A cannot lie about giving money
    more than x. The economics of demand and supply decide the real-world worth of
    a Bitcoin. As of writing this book, 1 Bitcoin (BTC) was valued over U.S. $4000!Now
    let’s apply the same logic to the car insurance situation we saw earlier. If there
    were a Blockchain network consisting of customers, insurers, repair shops, and
    hospitals, everyone on the network would know of your insurance contract with
    an insurer. In the case of a medical claim for the person you injured, the hospital
    can instantly check your insurance contract to quickly facilitate the claim. In
    the case of a car damage claim, chances of getting unfairly duped by the insurer
    because of a complicated process would reduce. With the help of an IoT device
    installed in your car, the insurer can find out various parameters during the
    accident such as speed, location, photo, etc. This would help the customer get
    fair claims. For the insurer, this would mean no exaggerated claims. As per a
    Deloitte report ( [https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/innovation/ch-en-innovation-deloitte-blockchain-app-in-insurance.pdf](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/innovation/ch-en-innovation-deloitte-blockchain-app-in-insurance.pdf)
    ), some customers are known to indulge in a practice called “crash for cash,”
    in which deliberately cause an accident to make claims. IoT devices with accurate
    sensors would prevent such scenarios. Another thing an insurer is protected from
    is multiple claims fraud. Scammers buy insurance policies from multiple insurers
    under made-up identities. Through a staged crash, they make multiple claims against
    the same accident. Such frauds are currently difficult to detect, as data is not
    shared by different insurers. A Blockchain network where multiple insurers are
    present and where fraudulent identity management is enforced will make it easy
    to detect a multiple claims fraud.Blockchain is explained in further detail in
    Chapter [7](A458845_1_En_7_Chapter.html).'

  zh: 你可能在流行的加密货币比特币的背景下听说过区块链。区块链的前身最早由斯图尔特·哈伯和 W. Scott Stornetta 在1991年的论文《如何给数字文档时间戳》中描述，在加密学杂志上发表。直到2008年，现代区块链的概念——或者最初称为块链——是在由中本聪在[metzdowd.com](http://metzdowd.com)
    上发表的著名论文《比特币：一个点对点的电子现金系统》中提出的。区块链被描述为比特币将要运作的后端基础设施。需要注意的是，没有人真正知道谁发明了比特币并撰写了相关论文。中本聪是一个由一个未知人或一组人发明比特币、实现第一个区块链并发布开源比特币软件的化名。已经有多次尝试找出中本聪的真实身份，包括美国国土安全部和
    NSA 的介入。虽然一些消息来源声称已经找到了神秘化名背后的真实人物，但并没有共识。直到今天，中本聪仍然是一个价值数十亿美元的隐秘人物，因为他/她拥有的比特币最初价值数十亿美元。比特币是一种虚拟的、电子的货币。它不是由银行发行的，也没有任何一个世界上的政府或权威机构认可它。没有官方的比特币货币票据和实体硬币。那么，它是如何工作的呢？它为什么有可信度呢？我们在区块链的简单定义中了解到，它可以被认为是一个大型的交易共享数据库。在比特币的情况下，它的区块链网络从少量的硬币（货币）开始。这些硬币然后分配给网络的成员。新的硬币可以通过一个耗时和资源密集型的过程，即比特币挖掘，引入到链中。每当重新分配或添加硬币时，交易都会被安全地记录在区块链的分类帐中。所以，如果A给B一定数量的钱，这个交易就会在每一个分类账本上被复制。实际上，网络上的每个人都知道A已经给了B
    x 数量的货币。因为每个人都知道这笔交易，所以没有争议。B不能谎称得到的钱少于x，A也不能谎称给的钱多于x。需求和供应的经济学决定了比特币在现实世界中的价值。截至本书撰写时，1比特币（BTC）的价值超过了4000美元！现在让我们将相同的逻辑应用于我们之前看到的汽车保险情况。如果有一个由客户、保险公司、修理店和医院组成的区块链网络，那么网络上的每个人都会知道你与保险公司的保险合同。在你伤害的人的医疗索赔情况下，医院可以立即检查你的保险合同以便快速处理索赔。在汽车损坏索赔的情况下，因为复杂的流程而被保险公司不公平欺骗的机会将会减少。通过在你的车上安装一个物联网设备，保险公司可以在事故发生时了解各种参数，如速度、位置、照片等。这将有助于客户获得公平的索赔。对于保险公司来说，这意味着没有夸大的索赔。根据德勤的一份报告（[https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/innovation/ch-en-innovation-deloitte-blockchain-app-in-insurance.pdf](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/innovation/ch-en-innovation-deloitte-blockchain-app-in-insurance.pdf)），一些客户被称为“为现金而碰撞”的做法所熟知，即故意制造事故以进行索赔。带有准确传感器的物联网设备将防止这种情况发生。保险公司受到保护的另一件事是多次索赔欺诈。欺诈者以虚构的身份从多家保险公司购买保险单。通过一个假意的撞车，他们对同一起事故进行多次索赔。目前很难检测到这种欺诈行为，因为数据没有被不同的保险公司共享。一个区块链网络，多家保险公司在其中，以及强制执行欺诈身份管理，将使检测多次索赔欺诈变得容易。区块链在第[7](A458845_1_En_7_Chapter.html)章中有进一步的解释。

    create today also depends on data in one form or another. While some apps come

    users. And, usually, there is an end goal to be met or insights to be obtained
    using the collected data, which may vary from a few kilobytes to gigabytes to
    terabytes in size. Through each revolution, it’s always been our intention to
    put the data to use as intelligently as possible.Take for instance a simple TODO
    application. The whole point of its existence is to provide a means to store user’s
    notes (data) to help them remember things. A simple, static TODO app will do just
    that. A more sophisticated TODO app will continuously analyze your notes (and
    probably your emails, SMS, calendar, etc.) to offer you suggestions on what you
    may need reminding.A social network is built totally on user data. Your status
    updates, comments, likes, photos, and so on, make Facebook the lively place that

    of other people. Based on your activity (likes, location, friends, and apps) on
    the social network, it cleverly shows your promotions and advertisements, things
    that Facebook actually gets paid for by publishers and companies. The same goes
    for Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Gmail, and more.A search engine may use search
    trends to offer customized ads. A travel app may share (at a cost) users’ booking
    and search data with airlines and hotels to allow them to offer better prices
    based on demand and supply. A maps app may collect users’ location data to offer
    real-time traffic predictions.Can you think of the importance of data in other

    paper-and-pen based process. Thousands of paper-based applications and forms filled
    up by customers had to be manually fed into the system by following a manual,
    labor-intensive process.The Internet revolution brought about an explosion of
    user-facing applications. Through websites and desktop software, users and customers
    could themselves submit data. The smartphone revolution took this to an unimaginably
    new level. These smart pocket devices not only allowed users to explicitly submit
    data whenever and wherever they wanted, they also allowed collection of implicit
    user data—data collected without the intervention of the user: location, audio,
    images, etc.We are currently in the midst of IoT revolution that has taken implicit
    user data collection further. Smartwatches automatically collect data about various
    health parameters, smart thermostats automatically collect temperature data, and
    custom IoT devices can be built with sensors to collect the desired data from

- en: We started with files, the sort of text files that you create in Notepad. Logs,
    configuration data, and even user data was stored in text files. Writing to text
    files was fast and simple. Large amounts of data could be split among several
    files for convenience. Reading data from files was a challenge, though. As we
    know, data stored in unstructured or partially structured formats is difficult
    to search and use for analysis. This gave rise to spreadsheets and relational
    databases, where data could be stored in orderly formats made up of rows and columns.
    Storing and looking up large amounts of data became easy. They also made it easy
    to generate reports and insights. Major RDBMSs, such as SQL Server, offer reporting
    and intelligence functionalities such as SSRS and SSIS. The problem with RDBMSs
    is that they weren’t made to handle billions of records. That’s where NoSQL came
    into picture.NoSQL databases are non-relational and do not enforce a set schema.
    Popular options, such as MongoDB and Cassandra, can store massive amounts of data
    (billions of records) in a way that is exponentially faster to save and retrieve.
    They are especially useful for storing semi-structured or unstructured data, and
    are used in environments where performance and speed are of utmost priority. Unstructured
    data is the one that grows at a rapid pace, as opposed to structured (relational)
    data, and analyzed to derive useful insights. And then there is Hadoop, a key
    driver of the Big Data revolution.Hadoop is capable of storing massive amounts
    of unstructured and structured data. Additionally, it provides the means to perform
    data analytics on the stored massive amounts of data to generate reports and dashboards.Now
    we have Blockchain, a mechanism to openly and securely store large amounts of
    data that is available to each member on the network. Blockchain should not be
    thought of as a replacement to other data storage mechanisms discussed here. Its
    use is only with transactional data, and it is often used in conjunction with
    NoSQL and relational databases.

  zh: 我们从文件开始，这种你在记事本中创建的文本文件。日志、配置数据，甚至用户数据都存储在文本文件中。写入文本文件是快速且简单的。大量数据可以方便地分成几个文件存储。但是，从文件中读取数据是一个挑战。正如我们所知，存储在非结构化或部分结构化格式中的数据很难搜索和用于分析。这导致了电子表格和关系数据库的出现，其中数据可以存储在由行和列组成的有序格式中。存储和查找大量数据变得容易。它们还使生成报告和见解变得容易。主要的关系数据库管理系统（RDBMS），如SQL
    Server，提供了报告和智能功能，如SSRS和SSIS。 RDBMS的问题在于它们无法处理数十亿条记录。这就是NoSQL出现的地方。NoSQL数据库是非关系型的，不强制执行一组模式。流行的选项，如MongoDB和Cassandra，可以以指数级更快的速度存储和检索大量数据（数十亿条记录）。它们特别适用于存储半结构化或非结构化数据，并且在性能和速度至关重要的环境中使用。非结构化数据是以快速的速度增长的数据，与结构化（关系）数据相反，分析以获取有用的见解。然后还有Hadoop，这是大数据革命的关键驱动力。Hadoop能够存储大量的非结构化和结构化数据。此外，它提供了对存储的大量数据执行数据分析以生成报告和仪表板的手段。现在我们有了区块链，这是一种机制，可以公开和安全地存储大量数据，供网络上的每个成员使用。区块链不应被视为替代这里讨论的其他数据存储机制。它仅用于事务数据，并且通常与NoSQL和关系数据库一起使用。

    2.0\. You will see how AI 2.0 can be used to build real-world solutions. For the
    purpose of this book, we’ll be focusing on the smart hospitals use case. Asclepius
    (pronounced ess-clip-ee-us) Consortium is our fictitious global network of 3+
    star-rated hospitals that want to work together to save more lives and make easier
    the lives of their patients through data sharing.We will build an AI 2.0 offering
    for the Asclepius Consortium that works in the following ways. All member hospitals
    and a bunch of insurance companies will be part of a dedicated Blockchain network.
    Medical records of patients across hospitals will be published on the Blockchain,
    including real-time patient monitoring data recorded through IoT devices. This
    will facilitate transparent sharing of patient data across hospitals and insurers.AI
    will facilitate real-time analytics on patient monitoring data, leading to better
    diagnoses. Patient data collected from across hospitals can also be centrally
    analyzed to generate results that can be later used to make life-saving predictions
    in the case of other patients.A network of such hospitals can keep track of all
    of medical inventory (equipment, machines, medicines, etc.) across hospitals.
    This will be helpful in the event of shortages of medical supplies.Along the same
    lines, it will be possible to create highly-accessible organ banks, including
    a blood bank and an eye bank.Transactions in which customers buy medical or life
    insurance from one of the insurers on this network will also be recorded. Availability
    of insurance records to hospitals will automate the claim process, making it simpler
    and time-saving. Availability of health records of patients to insurers will prevent
    potential frauds.

  zh: 在本书中，您将学习和使用构成 AI 2.0 的技术。您将看到 AI 2.0 如何用于构建现实世界的解决方案。针对本书的目的，我们将专注于智能医院用例。Asclepius（发音为
    ess-clip-ee-us）联盟是我们虚构的全球 3+ 星级医院网络，他们希望通过数据共享合作，挽救更多的生命并简化患者的生活。我们将为 Asclepius
    联盟构建一个 AI 2.0 解决方案，其工作方式如下。所有成员医院和一些保险公司将成为专用区块链网络的一部分。横跨医院的患者医疗记录将被发布在区块链上，包括通过物联网设备记录的实时患者监测数据。这将促进跨医院和保险公司之间的透明共享患者数据。人工智能将促进对患者监测数据的实时分析，从而实现更好的诊断。横跨医院收集的患者数据也可以进行中央分析，以生成后续可用于对其他患者进行生命救助预测的结果。这样的医院网络可以跟踪横跨医院的所有医疗库存（设备、机器、药品等）。在医疗用品短缺的情况下，这将是有帮助的。同样，可以创建高度可访问的器官库，包括血库和眼库。在这一网络上，顾客从其中一家保险公司购买医疗或人身保险的交易也将被记录。医院对保险记录的可用性将自动化理赔流程，使其更简单和节省时间。患者的健康记录对保险公司的可用性将防止潜在的欺诈。
