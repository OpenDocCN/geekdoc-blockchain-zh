    New York, USAA book introducing Ethereum and Solidity would not be complete without
    mention of the nascent cult of personality forming around Vitalik Buterin, the
    inventor of Ethereum and a collaborator on a handful of other high-profile blockchain

    intensely. I didn’t bother him, and he didn’t say hello. But, I remember the impression
    he made on me at the time. This skeletal, 19-year-old boy, who was all limbs and
    joints, was hovering above his laptop like a praying mantis, delivering it nimble,
    lethal blows at an incredible speed.Buterin, it turned out, was the reason everyone
    was there in the first place. Two months earlier, he had published a white paper
    describing an impossibly ambitious technology, one that looked beyond Bitcoin’s
    mission of enabling unstoppable, unmediated digital payments, and envisioned a
    platform for autonomous software of all kinds.

    intellectual leadership stands alone. Perhaps the most shocking thing about it,
    besides the jaw-dropping ambition of the project to replace the HTTP Web with
    something better, is the speed.The Ethereum project was launched in 2014, operational
    by 2015, and was the number two cryptocurrency network after Bitcoin by 2016\.

    .In 2017, the core development team plans to roll out other components that will
    see Ethereum reach parity with the web applications we know and love today—but
    with an astounding new set of capabilities like those described in all the previous
    chapters.The rest of this chapter concerns the Ethereum roadmap, and some of the
    yet-unsolved and unbuilt components.If you’d like to stop here to dig into the
    mathematics, economics, and business rationale behind the Ethereum network as
    it works today, you’ll find no better place for long, in-depth essays than the
    Ethereum blog, where Buterin has laid out his thinking about some of the protocol’s
    core concepts.

    sharding it and storing it across a distributed network in ways that make it easy
    to recall when an application needs. The goal of Swarm is to be able to find different
    versions of a file under the same memory address, mimicking domain paths in today’s
    URLs, with their folder structure.It’s important to note that this addressing
    protocol is hardware-agnostic. It’s merely serving the purpose of an index to
    which chunks of data are stored where. This blob storage scenario is a popular
    application for decentralized systems, and Swarm would make it even easier, thanks
    to some of the innovations pioneered by BitTorrent. If you don’t want to wait
    for Swarm, check out an existing distributed file storage protocol called Interplanetary
    File System, or IPFS, which can also be made to work with Ethereum dapps.Let’s
    say it’s the year 2020 and you visit an Ethereum application in the Mist browser.
    By this point, let’s imagine there’s a human-readable namespacing system in place;
    Ethereum is at full parity with the Web complete with its own domain name lookup
    system. Here’s how the data retrieval process would work with a dapp using the

    nodes that fully commit to a block, meaning they lose their ETH balance (which

    element of scaling. Sharding is the process of breaking up a single chunk of data
    across databases, in such a way that it can be reassembled when needed. Blockchains
    don’t shard. However, it should be feasible to let different parts of the EVM
    state be stored by different nodes, and to build applications that can address
    them there.

    mining ends? It’s hard to say. But Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other cryptonetworks
    will have several fairly predictable impacts on business IT.One of the great 20th-century
    economists, Ronald Coase, is famous for his insight that firms exist in the first
    place to avoid the “transaction costs” of going to the market every day looking
    for workers. Firms create long-term employment agreements that increase efficiency.
    But these same bureaucratic processes that increase efficiency among a group of
    a few dozen workers can become a hindrance at scale, making large firms slow and
    uncompetitive. As a result, they attempt to find an equilibrium point where the
    minimal amount of bureaucracy creates maximum efficiency.For the last 20 years,
    technology has increased the speed of business, as corporations have developed
    expertise in large-scale software systems. Of late, great amounts of effort have
    been put into making these systems more adept at dealing with contractors, consultants,
    and freelancers. These temporary workers enable companies to spin up teams quickly
    when demand arises, and spin them back down without needing to lay off full-time
    employees. The boundaries of the modern company are becoming more permeable. According
    to a study by the software company Intuit, roughly 40 percent of the American
    workforce will be “contingent workers” by 2020.[³](#Fn3)Ethereum promises to bolster
    the trend. When the entire world can operate within a global transaction singleton
    that can execute trustless applications, the confines of the office building (or
    the virtual private network, or the firm itself) become less and less necessary.
    When compensation packages can easily be composed of a series of if-then statements
    in a smart contract, the distinction between a salary and a bonus become blurred.
    The size, age, or location of a company may no longer carry cultural connotations
    about its trustworthiness or importance. The era of the lifetime employee, the
    company man or company woman, may be ending.This shift is being recognized at
    the highest levels of government and banking. On January 18, 2017, Federal Reserve
    Chair Janet Yellen was asked about the promise of blockchain technology during
    a fireside chat held at the Commonwealth Club of California. Her response:'

    businesses come to grips with their freedom to engage in business agreements,
    some even long-term, with little need for counterparties, and little concern for
    corporate or even state boundaries. Multimillion-dollar deals may (for a while)
    still be inked on pen and paper, but how many $1 to $100,000 contracts might be
    handled by Ethereum machines running boilerplate policies? How many wasted dollars
    and work hours could be saved? How many disagreements rendered immaterial? How
    many business agreements might be made more fair and enforceable? Many, no doubt.
    Ultimately, that is the promise of Ethereum.Footnotes[1](#Fn1_source)Backchannel,
