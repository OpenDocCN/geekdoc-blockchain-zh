    a veritable gold digger mood. More and more new cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum
    blockchain saw the light of day in the digital world. It wasn't long before there
    was an increase in network congestion, with significantly increased transaction
    fees as a result. But one of the reasons for the high utilization was, among other
    things, the creation and trading with CryptoKitties. [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)

    game. Each cat is unique and thus only present once on the blockchain. The special
    thing about them is that in the on-chain computer game, new unique CryptoKitties
