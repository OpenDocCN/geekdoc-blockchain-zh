    unprecedented digital ventures. Through sensor technology, it has infused intelligence

    In his paper, Szabo mused about the creation of a be-all end-all technology protocol,
    one that designated God the trusted third party in the middle of all transactions:
    “All the parties would send their inputs to God. God would reliably determine

    learn from their own inputs and the output.”[⁴](notes.xhtml#en0004en) His point

    move from an Internet driven primarily by the falling costs of search, coordination,
    data collection, and decision making—where the name of the game was monitoring,
    mediating, and monetizing information and transactions on the Web—to one driven
    by the falling costs of bargaining, policing, and enforcing social and commercial
    agreements, where the name of the game will be integrity, security, collaboration,
    the privacy of all transactions, and the creation and distribution of value. That’s
    a 180-degree turn in strategy. The result can be an economy of peers with institutions
    that are truly distributed, inclusive, and empowering—and thereby legitimate.
    By fundamentally changing what we can do online, how we do it, and who can participate,

    for reaching consensus is critical. “Consensus is a social process,” blogged Vitalik
    Buterin, pioneer of the Ethereum blockchain. “Human beings are fairly good at
    engaging in consensus … without any help from algorithms.” He explained that,
    once a system scales beyond an individual’s ability to do the math, people turn
    to software agents. In peer-to-peer networks, the consensus algorithm divvies
    up the right to update the status of the network, that is, to vote on the truth.
    The algorithm doles out this right to a group of peers who constitute an economic
    set, a set that has skin in the game, so to speak. According to Buterin, what’s
    important about this economic set is that its members are securely distributed:

    (PoW) mechanism. This may sound complicated but the idea is a simple one. Because
    we can’t rely on the identity of the miners to select who creates the next block,
    we instead create a puzzle that is hard to solve (i.e., it takes a lot of *work*),
    but easy to verify (i.e., everyone else can check the answer very quickly). Participants
    agree that whoever solves the problem first gets to create the next block. Miners
    have to expend resources (computing hardware and electricity) to solve the puzzle
    by finding the right hash, a kind of unique fingerprint for a text or a data file.
    For each block they find, miners receive bitcoin as a reward. The puzzle is mathematically
    set up to make it impossible to find a shortcut to solve it. That’s why, when
    the rest of the network sees the answer, everyone trusts that a lot of work went
    into producing it. Also, this puzzle solving is continuous “to the tune of 500,000
    trillion hashes per second,” according to Dino Mark Angaritis. Miners are “looking
    for a hash that meets the target. It is statistically bound to occur every ten
    minutes. It’s a Poisson process, so that sometimes it takes one minute and sometimes
    one hour, but on average, it’s ten minutes.” Angaritis explained how it works:
    “Miners gather all the pending transactions that they find on the network and
    run the data through a cryptographic digest function called the secure hash algorithm
    (SHA-256), which outputs a 32-byte *hash value*. If the hash value is below a
    certain target (set by the network and adjusted every 2,016 blocks), then the
    miner has found the answer to the puzzle and has ‘solved’ the block. Unfortunately
    for the miner, finding the right hash value is very difficult. If the hash value
    is wrong, the miner adjusts the input data slightly and tries again. Each attempt
    results in an *entirely different* hash value. Miners have to try many times to
    find the right answer. As of November 2015, the number of hash attempts is on
    average 350 million trillion. That’s a lot of work!”[⁸](notes.xhtml#en0043en)'

    blockchain—Frontier—also uses proof of work, but the developers of Ethereum 1.1
    expect to replace it with a *proof of stake* mechanism. Proof of stake requires
    miners to invest in and hang on to some store of value (i.e., the native token
    of the blockchain such as Peercoin, NXT, etc.). They needn’t spend energy to vote.
    Other blockchains, such as Ripple and Stellar, rely on social networks for consensus
    and may recommend that new participants (i.e., new nodes) generate a *unique node
    list* of at least one hundred nodes they can trust in voting on the state of affairs.
    This type of proof is biased: newcomers need social intelligence and reputation
    to participate. *Proof of activity* is another mechanism; it combines proof of
    work and proof of stake, where a random number of miners must sign off on the
    block using a cryptokey before the block becomes official.[⁹](notes.xhtml#en0044en)

    In other words, we can’t trade what isn’t ours on the blockchain, whether it’s

    As the Ledger of Everything, the blockchain can serve as a public registry through
    such tools as Proof of Existence (PoE), a site that creates and registers cryptographic
    digests of deeds, titles, receipts, or licenses on the blockchain. Proof of Existence
    doesn’t maintain a copy of any original document; the hash of the document is
    calculated on the user’s machine, not on the PoE site, thus ensuring confidentiality
    of content. Even if a central authority shuts down Proof of Existence, the proof
    remains on the blockchain.[^(41)](notes.xhtml#en0076en) So the blockchain provides

    implementation. And so, for more complex transactions involving bundles of rights
    and multiple parties, we now have the *smart contract*, a piece of special purpose
    code that executes a complex set of instructions on the blockchain. “That intersection
    of legal descriptions and software is fundamental, and the smart contracts are
    the first step in that direction,” said Steve Omohundro, president of think tank
    Self-Aware Systems. “Once the principles of how you codify law digitally become
    more understood, then I think every country will start doing it …. Each jurisdiction
    would encode its laws, precisely and digitally, and there would be translation
    programs between them …. Getting rid of the friction of all legal stuff is going
    to be a huge economic gain.”[^(42)](notes.xhtml#en0077en)

    as a composer might assign a completed song to a music publisher. The code of
    the contract could include the term or duration of the assignment, the magnitude
    of royalties that would flow from the publisher’s to the composer’s bitcoin account
    during the term, and some triggers for terminating the contract. For example,
    if the composer’s account received less than a quarter of a bitcoin in a consecutive
    thirty-day period, then all rights would automatically revert to the composer,
    and the publisher would no longer have access to the composer’s work registered
    on the blockchain. To set this smart contract in motion, both the composer and
    the publisher—and perhaps representatives of the publisher’s finance and legal
    teams—would sign using their private keys.

    including social contracts. “If you have a big transaction with a specific control
    structure, you can predict the outcome at any period in time,” said Antonopoulos.
    “If I have a fully verified signed transaction with a number of signatures in
    a multisignature account, I can predict whether that transaction will be verifiable
    by the network. And if it is verifiable by the network, then that transaction
    can be redeemed and irrevocably so. No central authority or third party can revoke
    it, no one can override the consensus of the network. That’s a new concept in
    both law and finance. The bitcoin system provides a very high degree of certainty

    network nodes from anywhere using any medium. Said Antonopoulos, “People could
    shut down the Internet, and I could still transmit that transaction over shortwave
    radio with Morse code. A government agency could try to censor my communication,
    and I could still transmit that transaction as a series of smiley emoticons over
    Skype. As long as someone on the other end could decode the transaction and record
    it in the blockchain, I could effect the [smart contract]. So we’ve converted
    something that, in law, is almost impossible to guarantee into something that

    processing power, which increases by about 60 percent annually (Moore’s law).
