    unprecedented digital ventures. Through sensor technology, it has infused intelligence

    In his paper, Szabo mused about the creation of a be-all end-all technology protocol,
    one that designated God the trusted third party in the middle of all transactions:
    “All the parties would send their inputs to God. God would reliably determine

    no party would learn anything more about the other parties’ inputs than they could
    learn from their own inputs and the output.”[⁴](notes.xhtml#en0004en) His point

    by transactions recorded in a blockchain—kind of like a global spreadsheet or
    ledger, which leverages the resources of a large peer-to-peer bitcoin network
    to verify and approve each bitcoin transaction. Each blockchain, like the one
    that uses bitcoin, is *distributed*: it runs on computers provided by volunteers
    around the world; there is no central database to hack. The blockchain is *public*:
    anyone can view it at any time because it resides on the network, not within a
    single institution charged with auditing transactions and keeping records. And
    the blockchain is *encrypted*: it uses heavy-duty encryption involving public
    and private keys (rather like the two-key system to access a safety deposit box)
    to maintain virtual security. You needn’t worry about the weak firewalls of Target
    or Home Depot or a thieving staffer of Morgan Stanley or the U.S. federal government.'

    conducted are verified, cleared, and stored in a block which is linked to the
    preceding block, thereby creating a chain. Each block must refer to the preceding
    block to be valid. This structure permanently time-stamps and stores exchanges
    of value, preventing anyone from altering the ledger. If you wanted to steal a
    bitcoin, you’d have to rewrite the coin’s entire history on the blockchain in
    broad daylight. That’s practically impossible. So the blockchain is a distributed
    ledger representing a network consensus of every transaction that has ever occurred.
    Like the World Wide Web of information, it’s the World Wide Ledger of value—a
    distributed ledger that everyone can download and run on their personal computer.

    an individual must possess, at minimum, access to some form of basic financial

    But these businesses have little to do with sharing. In fact, they are successful
    precisely because they do not share—they aggregate. It is an aggregating economy.
    Uber is a $65 billion corporation that aggregates driving services. Airbnb, the
    $25 billion Silicon Valley darling, aggregates vacant rooms. Others aggregate
    equipment and handymen through their centralized, proprietary platforms and then
    resell them. In the process, they collect data for commercial exploitation. None
    of these companies existed a decade ago because the technological preconditions
    were not there: ubiquitous smart phones, full GPS, and sophisticated payment systems.

    thirty years ago when I started going to conferences in Germany. It is no accident
    that Germany is the leading privacy and data protection country in the world.
    They had to endure the abuses of the Third Reich and the complete cessation of
    all of their freedoms, which started with the complete removal of their privacy.

    peer-to-peer computational platforms to guarantee user privacy is called Enigma,
    also the name given to the machine developed by German engineer Arthur Scherbius
    to transcribe coded information. Scherbius designed Enigma for commercial use:
    through his device, global companies could quickly and safely communicate their
    trade secrets, stock tips, and other insider information. Within a few years,
    Germany’s military forces were manufacturing their own versions of Enigma to broadcast
    coded messages over radio to troops. During the war, the Nazis used Enigma to
    disseminate strategic plans, details of targets, and the timing of attacks. It

    your information—any information—breaks it up, and encrypts it into pieces of
    data that are randomly distributed to nodes in the network. It doesn’t exist in
    one spot,” said Cavoukian. “Enigma uses blockchain technology to embed the data

    the code speak for itself. Let the network reach consensus algorithmically on
    what happened and record it cryptographically on the blockchain. The mechanism
    for reaching consensus is critical. “Consensus is a social process,” blogged Vitalik
    Buterin, pioneer of the Ethereum blockchain. “Human beings are fairly good at
    engaging in consensus … without any help from algorithms.” He explained that,
    once a system scales beyond an individual’s ability to do the math, people turn
    to software agents. In peer-to-peer networks, the consensus algorithm divvies
    up the right to update the status of the network, that is, to vote on the truth.
    The algorithm doles out this right to a group of peers who constitute an economic
    set, a set that has skin in the game, so to speak. According to Buterin, what’s
    important about this economic set is that its members are securely distributed:
    no single member or cartel should be able to overtake a majority, even if they
    had the means and incentive to do so.[⁷](notes.xhtml#en0042en)'

    (PoW) mechanism. This may sound complicated but the idea is a simple one. Because
    we can’t rely on the identity of the miners to select who creates the next block,
    we instead create a puzzle that is hard to solve (i.e., it takes a lot of *work*),
    but easy to verify (i.e., everyone else can check the answer very quickly). Participants
    agree that whoever solves the problem first gets to create the next block. Miners
    have to expend resources (computing hardware and electricity) to solve the puzzle
    by finding the right hash, a kind of unique fingerprint for a text or a data file.
    For each block they find, miners receive bitcoin as a reward. The puzzle is mathematically
    set up to make it impossible to find a shortcut to solve it. That’s why, when
    the rest of the network sees the answer, everyone trusts that a lot of work went
    into producing it. Also, this puzzle solving is continuous “to the tune of 500,000
    trillion hashes per second,” according to Dino Mark Angaritis. Miners are “looking
    for a hash that meets the target. It is statistically bound to occur every ten
    minutes. It’s a Poisson process, so that sometimes it takes one minute and sometimes
    one hour, but on average, it’s ten minutes.” Angaritis explained how it works:
    “Miners gather all the pending transactions that they find on the network and
    run the data through a cryptographic digest function called the secure hash algorithm
    (SHA-256), which outputs a 32-byte *hash value*. If the hash value is below a
    certain target (set by the network and adjusted every 2,016 blocks), then the
    miner has found the answer to the puzzle and has ‘solved’ the block. Unfortunately
    for the miner, finding the right hash value is very difficult. If the hash value
    is wrong, the miner adjusts the input data slightly and tries again. Each attempt
    results in an *entirely different* hash value. Miners have to try many times to
    find the right answer. As of November 2015, the number of hash attempts is on
    average 350 million trillion. That’s a lot of work!”[⁸](notes.xhtml#en0043en)'

    blockchain—Frontier—also uses proof of work, but the developers of Ethereum 1.1
    expect to replace it with a *proof of stake* mechanism. Proof of stake requires
    miners to invest in and hang on to some store of value (i.e., the native token
    of the blockchain such as Peercoin, NXT, etc.). They needn’t spend energy to vote.
    Other blockchains, such as Ripple and Stellar, rely on social networks for consensus
    and may recommend that new participants (i.e., new nodes) generate a *unique node
    list* of at least one hundred nodes they can trust in voting on the state of affairs.
    This type of proof is biased: newcomers need social intelligence and reputation
    to participate. *Proof of activity* is another mechanism; it combines proof of
    work and proof of stake, where a random number of miners must sign off on the
    block using a cryptokey before the block becomes official.[⁹](notes.xhtml#en0044en)

    assets, intellectual property, or Personal BlackBox’s privacy tool with a publicity
    rights module for the Kardashians. We need greater education about rights and
    the development of new understandings about rights management systems. We’ll have
    voting rights management systems and property rights management systems. Some
    start-up will create a rights dashboard that will indicate a person’s level of
    civic engagement, where voting is but one of several measures, like donating skills,
    reputation, time, and bitcoin or providing free access to one’s physical or intellectual
    property. Buckle up.

    people without a bank account, and in the developed world, prosperity is actually
    declining as social inequality continues to grow. In developing economies, mobile
    is often the only affordable means of connecting. Most financial institutions
    have mobile payment apps that combine cameras and QR codes. However, the fees
    needed to support these intermediaries make micropayments impractical. Consumers
    at the bottom of the pyramid still can’t afford the minimum account balances,
    minimum payment amounts, or transaction fees to use the system. Its infrastructure
    costs make micropayments and microaccounts unfeasible.

    (TCP/IP), but it could run without the Internet if necessary. Satoshi imagined
    that the typical person would be interacting with the blockchain through what
    he called “simplified payment verification” (SPV) mode that can work on cell phones
    to mobilize the blockchain. Now anyone with a flip phone can participate in the
    economy, or in a market, as a producer or consumer. No bank account required,
    no proof of citizenship required, no birth certificate required, no home address
    required, no stable local currency required to use the blockchain technologies.
    The blockchain drastically lowers the cost of transmitting such funds as remittances.
    It significantly lowers the barrier to having a bank account, obtaining credit,
    and investing. And it supports entrepreneurship and participation in global trade.'

    economies, the situation was worse. When corrupt or incompetent bureaucrats in
    failed states need funding to run the government, their central banks and treasuries
    simply print more currency and then profit from the difference between the cost
    of manufacturing and the face value of the currency. That’s seigniorage. The increase
    in the money supply debases the currency. If the local economy really tanked—as
    it did in Argentina and Uruguay, and more recently in Cyprus and Greece—these
    central bodies could freeze the bank assets of whoever couldn’t afford a bribe.
    Given such a possibility, the wealthy could store their assets in more trustworthy
    jurisdictions and more stable currencies.

    Hill. “There isn’t a trusted entity that has governance over land title, and so
    allowing people to actually say, ‘I own this property,’ and then use that for
    collateral to improve them and their family situation is a fascinating use case.”[^(52)](notes.xhtml#en0087en)

    where high-end user bandwidth increases by 50 percent each year, whereas the bandwidth
    of the masses tends to lag by two or three years. Bandwidth lags behind computer
    processing power, which increases by about 60 percent annually (Moore’s law).
    So bandwidth is the gating factor, according to Jakob Nielsen.[^(53)](notes.xhtml#en0088en)
    Most designs—interfaces, Web sites, digital products, services, organizations,
    and so forth—will need to accommodate the technology of the masses to leverage
    network effects. So inclusion means considering the full spectrum of usage—not
    just the state of the science of high-end users, but the slow tech and sporadic
    power outages of users in remote regions of the world’s poorest countries.

    overall prosperity in the Western world for most people is no longer improving.
    The foundation for prosperity is inclusion, and blockchains can help. Let’s be
    clear that inclusion has multiple dimensions. It means an end to social, economic,
    and racial hegemony, an end to discrimination based on health, gender, sexual
    identification, or sexual preference. It means ending barriers to access because
    of where a person lives, whether a person spent a night in jail, or how a person
    voted, but also an end to glass ceilings, and good ol’ boys’ clubs of countless

    on the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of National Socialism, victims of Hitler’s
    regime. “Our moral obligations cannot be fulfilled solely at the level of remembrance.
    There also exists within us a deep and abiding certainty that remembrance bestows
    a mission on us. That mission tells us to protect and preserve humanity. It tells
    us to protect and preserve the rights of every human being.”[^(54)](notes.xhtml#en0089en)
