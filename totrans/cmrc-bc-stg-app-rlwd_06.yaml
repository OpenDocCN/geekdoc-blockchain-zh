  zh: 流动性问题 – 如果你有许多公司间的余额，并且它们不是每天结算，那么集团中的一部分可能会有“真实现金”闲置，这可能是不希望的。例如，你可能在德国实体中有正的现金余额，但由于公司间的问题，没有向美国实体结算
    – 这意味着美国实体现在需要借款，而不是使用其他实体的现金。
- en: Foreign exchange management – most intercompany issues span different currency
    regions, and as such, means that intercompany delays and issues stifle the ability
    to manage your FX risk well. For example, the German euro account could be better
    used in the US dollar account but the money is stuck in the wrong currency, which
    can lead to real losses for the group.

  zh: 外汇管理 – 大多数公司间问题跨越不同的货币区域，因此，公司间延迟和问题阻碍了有效管理外汇风险的能力。例如，德国欧元账户中的钱可能更适合用于美国美元账户，但钱被困在了错误的货币中，这可能导致集团产生真正的损失。
- en: Tax and regulatory reporting issues – most countries have similar, but different,
    rules around accounting and reporting of financial performance. You could easily
    find a situation where you have a balance in one entity not agreed with another,
    but one entity must report a final figure for the regulatory deadline. With tax,
    this could mean paying too much or too little tax and not being able to maximize
    your tax liability efficiently across the group.

  zh: 税收和监管报告问题 – 大多数国家在会计和财务业绩报告方面的规定相似但又不同。你可能会遇到一个实体的余额与另一个实体不一致的情况，但有一个实体必须在一个监管截止日期前报告一个最终数字。在税务方面，这可能意味着支付过多或过少的税款，并且无法有效地在整个集团内最大化税务负担。
- en: Mergers and acquisitions – when it comes to buying and selling entities, there
    is often a neglected intercompany balance sheet which could uncover surprises
    to both the seller and the buyer. If the intercompany accounts are not managed
    well, when one entity from the group is sold, there may be balances within that
    entity which should be in another entity – meaning that you could give away more
    or less of the business than you think.

    – 这意味着你可能会给出比你认为的更多的或更少的业务。
