- en: The adoption of blockchain technology by the banking industry entails significant
    regulatory issues, since the technology can pose several challenges to existing
    legal and regulatory frameworks. This chapter addresses the main regulatory issues
    in blockchain technology. After presenting the main risks and problems associated
    with the use of the technology and its main applications, the chapter outlines
    the responses undertaken by regulators and authorities around the world with a
    specific focus on both the US and the EU context.

    highlighted that blockchain can benefit banks in several ways: efficiency improvement,
    product innovation and the ability to reach new customers. It can also pose new
    risks related to the increasing competition between blockchain-based companies
    that provide banking services. Nevertheless, it has been noted that the opportunities
    and risks presented by blockchain are tied to significant regulatory issues since
    its adoption can challenge the existing legal and regulatory framework, and such
    challenges must be addressed before blockchain is adopted. This is particularly
    true for highly regulated sectors like banking, which is characterised by forms
    of centralised control where central authorities (e.g. central banks) are accountable
    and responsible for providing the services to all the other participants.'

    (EU) context. Regulatory issues deriving from first-generation blockchain—i.e.
    blockchain used to launch cryptocurrencies (in general, public blockchains)—are
    different from those deriving from second-generation blockchain—i.e. the adoption
    of blockchain’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) to provide banking services
    (in general, private blockchains). Therefore, their regulatory implications and
    related responses will be discussed separately.

- en: One of the main concerns that regulators and policymakers have about blockchain
    technology has to do with cryptocurrencies, which can allow users to avoid regulation
    and engage in misconduct. As highlighted in Chapter [3](490216_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml),
    owing to its anonymity, cross-border nature and quick transferability, the use
    of blockchain in cryptocurrencies is well suited to illicit activities such as
    fraud and manipulation, tax evasion, hacking, money laundering and funding for
    terrorist activities^([1](#Fn1)) (Houben and Snyers [2018](#CR41)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Above all, the anonymity inherent in public blockchains, which varies from
    complete anonymity to pseudo-anonymity, can prevent cryptocurrency transactions
    from being adequately monitored, thus allowing transactions to occur outside the
    regulatory perimeter and, consequently, enabling individuals to use cryptocurrencies
    for unlawful activities. As reported in the European Commission’s Impact Assessment
    (EC [2016](#CR18)) accompanying its Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) proposal,
    the anonymity surrounding virtual currencies imposes an intrinsic limitation on
    identification and monitoring possibilities, given that authorities are unable
    to link identities with transactions, which generates a problem regarding transaction
    traceability. Meanwhile, for issues related to anti-terrorism and tax avoidance,
    among others, banks must adhere to strict regulations associated with Know Your
    Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws: they must track transactions
    step by step and should be able to identify the actors involved in transactions
    to safeguard financial systems and customers and increase transparency. In addition,
    the intrinsically cross-border nature of blockchain represents another major challenge
    for regulators since decentralisation could boost the degree to which financial
    services are provided across borders, thereby intensifying jurisdictional uncertainty.
    Cryptocurrency transactions can also be carried out in jurisdictions that do not
    have effective controls against money laundering and terrorist financing, which
    raises questions about regulatory enforcement of misconduct. As a result, regulators
    around the world are trying to define cryptocurrencies’ scope to avoid their use
    for illicit activities.'

    with the use of blockchain technology to launch cryptocurrencies. They aim to
    prevent theft, fraud, market manipulation and money laundering (PWC [2018](#CR8);
    French and Stettner [2019](#CR33)). To date, there has not been a common taxonomy
    of cryptocurrencies or a shared understanding of how they should be treated from
    a regulatory standpoint (ECB [2019](#CR21)). The legal status of cryptocurrencies
    varies by country, and the variety of approaches ranges from total bans to regulating
    support for the particular activity. The following subsections present an overview

- en: 'In the US context, the regulation of cryptocurrencies has evolved into a multi-faceted
    and multi-regulatory approach, since its scope falls under different authorities
    (Beauchamp et al. [2019](#CR7)) depending on whether cryptocurrencies are considered
    as securities, commodities or currencies. In December 2019, to clarify which federal
    agencies regulate cryptocurrencies and, consequently, establish their areas of
    regulatory oversight, the “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020” was introduced to define
    categories of crypto-assets and specify the federal regulatory agencies authorised
    to regulate them. The discussion draft of this bill introduced new definitions
    for categories of crypto-assets like “crypto-commodity”, “crypto-currency” and
    “crypto-security” and assigned each category to a sole regulator: the Commodity
    Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would have the authority to regulate crypto-commodities;
    the Secretary of the Treasury, acting through the US Department of the Treasury’s
    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), would have the authority to regulate
    cryptocurrencies; and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be able
    to regulate crypto-securities.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    cryptocurrency activities by taking several measures and issuing numerous enforcement
    actions to bring transparency and integrity to the cryptocurrency markets and
    deter and prosecute fraud and abuse.

- en: First, the SEC has been monitoring cryptocurrencies, particularly with regard
    to initial coin offerings (ICOs), to prevent fraud and other misconduct. Depending
    on the nature of the digital asset, including the rights it purports to convey
    and how it is offered and sold, the SEC provides that cryptocurrencies may be
    defined as a security under the US federal securities laws and, thus, would fall
    under SEC’s jurisdiction of enforcing federal securities laws. Accordingly, like
    any other activity involving an offering of securities, ICOs that represent offerings
    of securities must comply with the registration requirements of the Securities
    Act; they must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other
    investor protections that US securities laws require (SEC [2017](#CR13)). This
    implies that such offerings and sales have to either be registered with the SEC^([2](#Fn2))
    or qualify for an exemption from registration. However, even if no registration
    is required, activities involving digital assets that are securities may still
    be subject to the commission’s regulation and oversight. Furthermore, the SEC
    provides that a platform permitting trade in digital assets that are securities
    and operating as an “exchange”, as defined by the federal securities laws, must
    register with the SEC as a national securities exchange. It is subject to cybersecurity
    requirements and obligations to have policies around preventing fraudulent and
    manipulative acts and practices unless it is exempt from registration (SEC [2018](#CR49);
    PWC [2018](#CR8)). In 2019, the SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial
    Technology (FinHub) published guidance providing a framework to help market participants
    assess whether a digital asset is offered and sold as an “investment contract”^([3](#Fn3))
    and, therefore, whether their offers and sales can be considered securities transactions
    (SEC [2019](#CR53)).

    derivatives markets. In 2014, the CFTC declared cryptocurrencies to be a “commodity”
    subject to oversight under its authority under the Commodity Exchange Act (CFTC
    [2018](#CR9)), thus extending the CFTC’s jurisdiction and regulatory framework
    over market participants’ proper registration, as well as fraudulent and manipulation
    activities, to the digital assets industry. This means that the CFTC has jurisdiction
    when a virtual currency is used in a derivatives contract or if there is fraud
    or manipulation involving a virtual currency traded in interstate commerce. Taking
    a similar approach to the SEC, the CFTC has mainly issued enforcement actions
    to prevent fraud and other abuse such as the misappropriation of funds in derivative
    markets and has issued numerous enforcement cases (PWC [2018](#CR8); Lucking and
    Aravind [2020](#CR45)). For instance, the CFTC has taken action against unregistered
    cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g. BitFinex) and enforced the laws prohibiting wash
    trading and pre-arranged trades on a derivatives platform. It has also issued
    proposed guidance on what a derivative market is and what qualifies as a spot
    market in the virtual currency context, as well as warnings about valuations and
    volatility in spot virtual currency markets (CFTC [2018](#CR9)).^([4](#Fn4)) In
    March 2020, the CFTC issued its final interpretive guidance concerning the term
    “actual delivery”^([5](#Fn5)) for digital assets in order to inform the public
    of the commission’s views when determining whether “actual delivery” has occurred
    in the context of retail commodity transactions involving virtual currencies.

    to AML requirements. Specifically, in the final rule relating to money services
    businesses ([2011](#CR28)),^([6](#Fn6)) FinCEN makes clear that persons (i.e.
    an individual, a corporation, a partnership, etc.) accepting and transmitting
    value that is a substitute for currency (e.g. virtual currency) are money transmitters^([7](#Fn7))
    and, consequently, are required—just like any other money transmitter—to register
    with FinCEN as money services businesses (MSBs) and comply with the AML programme’s
    recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements. In March 2013, to address
    some of the concerns raised by the industry, FinCEN also issued interpretive guidance
    (hereafter, “the Guidance”)^([8](#Fn8)) on the application of its regulations
    to transactions involving the acceptance of currency or funds and the transmission
    of “convertible virtual currencies” (CVCs). The Guidance describes what CVC are
    for purposes of FinCEN regulations and reminding the public that persons who are
    not exempt from MSB status and accept and transmit either real currency or anything
    of value that substitutes for currency, including virtual currency, are covered
    under the definition of money transmitter. Moreover, in May 2019, the FinCEN issued
    interpretive guidance to clarify for those who are subject to the Bank Secrecy
    Act how FinCEN regulations relating to money services businesses apply to certain
    business models involving money transmission denominated in CVCs. This Guidance
    (2019) does not establish any new regulatory expectations or requirements but
    consolidates current FinCEN regulations and related administrative rulings and
    guidance issued since 2011\. It applies these rules and interpretations to other
    common business models involving CVCs engaged in the same underlying patterns
    of activity.^([9](#Fn9))

    Anti-Money Laundering Directive (or AMLD5),^([10](#Fn10)) which amends the Fourth
    Anti-Money Laundering Directive, extends the definition of “obliged entities”
    to include virtual currency exchanges, defined as “providers engaged in exchange
    services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies”, and custodian wallet
    providers, defined as “an entity that provides services to safeguard private cryptographic
    keys on behalf of its customers, to hold, store and transfer virtual currencies”.
    Accordingly, virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers have to
    comply with the same AML/CFT requirements as banks and other financial institutions:
    they must register with the national AML authorities, implement customer due diligence
    controls, monitor virtual currency transactions and report suspicious activity
    to government entities (Houben and Snyers [2020](#CR40)).'

    Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) assess the EU regulatory framework’s suitability
    to ICOs and crypto-assets more generally in order to address regulatory concerns
    about investments in crypto-assets. To this end, while ESMA has focused on ICOs
    and assessed whether crypto-assets may qualify as “financial instruments” under
    Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID), the EBA carried out a regulatory mapping of the
    applicability of current EU financial services law to crypto-assets within its
    sphere of responsibility by analysing the qualification of crypto-assets under
    the second Electronic Money Directive (Directive 2009/110/EC) and the second Payment
    Services Directive (Directive 2015/2366/EU).

- en: First, ESMA analysed the legal qualification of crypto-assets under EU financial
    securities laws in line with its remit. To this end, ESMA surveyed^([11](#Fn11))
    national competent authorities (NCAs) in the summer of 2018 to collect detailed
    feedback on the possible legal qualification of crypto-assets as financial instruments.^([12](#Fn12))
    The outcome of the survey showed that, according to most NCAs, some crypto-assets
    (e.g. those with profit rights attached) could be deemed “transferable securities”
    and/or other types of financial instruments as defined under MiFID II (ESMA [2019](#CR25)).
    This means that some types of crypto-assets, provided they meet the relevant conditions,
    may qualify as transferable securities and/or other types of financial instruments
    and, therefore, should comply with the existing EU financial regulations.^([13](#Fn13))
    However, the survey’s results also showed that there were some variations across
    NCAs regarding the number of cases that would qualify, which depended on the relevant
    Member State’s national definition of financial instruments. This means that the
    classification of a crypto-asset as a financial instrument is the responsibility
    of an individual NCA and will depend on the specific national implementation of
    EU law and the information and evidence provided to that NCA.^([14](#Fn14)) Accordingly,
    the same crypto-asset could be a financial instrument in one jurisdiction but
    not in another.

    money”^([15](#Fn15)) within the second Electronic Money Directive (EMD2) or as
    “funds” under the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), thereby complementing
    ESMA’s analysis of whether crypto-assets may qualify as “financial instruments”
    according to the MiFID. The EBA ([2019a](#CR15)) provides that, based on the specific
    characteristics of the crypto-asset, the asset may qualify as “electronic money”
    and, therefore, fall within the scope of the EMD2\. For that reason, under Title
    II of EMD2, an electronic money institution requires authorisation to carry out
    activities involving electronic money, unless a limited network exemption applies
    in accordance with Article 9 of the same directive. Moreover, in the hypothesis
    that a firm proposes to use DLT to carry out a “payment service” as listed in
    Annex I to the PSD2 (e.g. the execution of payment transactions, including issuing
    “payment instruments” and/or acquiring payment transactions and money remittance)
    with a crypto-asset that qualifies as “electronic money”, such an activity would
    fall within the scope of the PSD2 by virtue of being “funds”.

- en: Hence, the current perimeter of regulation in the EU is such that crypto-assets
    may, depending on their characteristics, qualify as financial instruments, electronic
    money or neither (EBA [2019a](#CR15)). Both ESMA and the EBA have identified many
    gaps and issues in the existing regulatory framework when applied to crypto-assets,
    as well as divergent approaches to the regulation of these activities across the
    EU. Consequently, they have pointed out the need for further action and the importance
    of undertaking an EU-wide approach to address regulatory concerns about cryptocurrencies.
    In September 2020, the EC adopted a comprehensive package of legislative proposals
    for regulating crypto-assets by updating certain financial market rules for crypto-assets
    and creating a legal framework for regulatory sandboxes of financial supervisors
    in the EU to use blockchains in the trading and post-trading of securities. Specifically,
    for crypto-assets qualifying as “financial instruments”, the commission proposed
    a pilot regime (i.e. a sandbox approach or controlled environment) for market
    infrastructures that wish to trade and settle transactions with financial instruments
    in crypto-asset form. This allows temporary derogations from existing rules so
    that regulators can gain experience on the use of DLT in market infrastructures
    while ensuring that they can deal with risks to investor protection, market integrity
    and financial stability. For other crypto-assets that do not qualify as “financial
    instruments”, such as utility tokens or payment tokens, the EC has proposed a
    specific new framework that would replace all other EU rules and national rules
    currently governing the issuing, trading and storing of such crypto-assets. This
    Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation aims to provide legal clarity and certainty
    to crypto-asset issuers and providers, covering not only entities issuing crypto-assets
    but also firms providing services around these crypto-assets (e.g. firms operating
    digital wallets), as well as cryptocurrency exchanges.

    and other cryptocurrencies as a form of money, although it recently increased
    scrutiny over exchanges’ cybersecurity, AML and anti-fraud policies following
    a series of hacks (PWC [2018](#CR8)). In 2016, building on work by a study group
    in the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the government submitted a bill to the
    Diet (the Japanese parliament) to amend the Payment Services Act (PSA) and the
    Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, which defines cryptocurrencies,
    as well as the registration requirements for a virtual currency exchange service
    provider who engages in the sale, purchase and exchange of VCs.^([16](#Fn16))
    Under the PSA, only business operators (persons) registered with the Prime Minister
    are allowed to engage in the virtual currency exchange service under the supervision
    of the FSA. Specifically, virtual currency exchange service providers are subject
    to national AML rules contained in the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal
    Proceeds, including customer identification programme and suspicious transaction
    reporting.^([17](#Fn17)) Accordingly, they are obligated to check the identities
    of customers who open accounts, keep transaction records and notify the relevant
    authorities if a suspicious transaction is identified. A bill was approved in
    2019 with proposed revisions to the PSA and the Financial Instruments and Exchange
    Acts (FIEA)—with specific regard to the introduction of the regulation governing
    crypto-assets derivative transactions—aimed at further strengthening the regulatory
    framework for virtual currencies ^([18](#Fn18)) (Awataguchi and Nagase [2020](#CR6)).
    Regarding the regulation of ICOs, the FIEA revisions introduced the concept of

    regulatory bodies^([21](#Fn21)) issued the Notice on Preventing Bitcoin Risk (hereafter
    “the Notice”), providing that Bitcoin is not to be treated as a currency and stating
    that financial and payment institutions may not be involved in cryptocurrencies
    activities: they may not use Bitcoin to set prices for product or services, they
    may not buy or sell Bitcoins, they may not act as a market maker for Bitcoins,
    they may not directly or indirectly provide other Bitcoin-related services, and
    they may not accept Bitcoin or use Bitcoin as a payment tool. In September 2017,
    seven Chinese central government regulators jointly issued the Announcement on
    Preventing Risks from Initial Coin Offerings (ICO Rules), which bans all ICO activities
    in the country, branding them as “unauthorized and illegal public fundraising”
    and suspecting them “of involv[ement] in criminal activities such as illegal selling
    of tokens, illegal issuance of securities, illegal fundraising, financial fraud
    and pyramid schemes”. In line with the 2013 Notice, the ICO Rules confirmed that
    the token or virtual currency used in coin offerings “does not have characteristics
    of money such as legal tender status and mandatory use, has no legal status equivalent
    to money, and cannot be circulated or used as currency in the market”. Accordingly,
    it required that cryptocurrencies trading platforms cease exchanges of cryptocurrency
    for statutory currency. The ICO Rules also prohibited financial institutions and
    non-bank payment institutions from directly or indirectly providing services for
    ICOs and cryptocurrencies, including account opening, registration, trading, clearing
    and settlement for fundraising through coin offering/virtual currencies and so
    on. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that neither the Notice nor the ICO Rules
    ban Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies from China; accordingly, there is no outright
    ban on individuals holding or transferring cryptocurrencies.'

    while ensuring that they are regulated (Reeves and Shen [2020](#CR49)), depending
    on the nature of the coin. According to the recently updated regulatory guidance
    (INFO 225) (2017)^([22](#Fn22)) by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission
    (ASIC), the legal status of cryptocurrencies depends on how they are structured
    and the right attached to the coin or token, which ultimately determines the regulations
    with which an entity must comply. Specifically, depending on the circumstances,
    coins or tokens may constitute interests in managed investment schemes, securities
    or derivatives or fall into a category of more generally defined financial products—all
    of which are subject to Australia’s financial services regulatory regime. Accordingly,
    entities offering coins or tokens that can be classified as financial products
    will need to comply with the regulatory requirements under the Corporations Act.
    These requirements generally include disclosure, registration, licensing and conduct
    obligations.^([23](#Fn23)) In 2017, the government passed the AML/CFT Amendment
    Act 2017, which went into force in April 2018 and brought cryptocurrencies and
    tokens under the purview of Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
    financing regulatory regime. As a result, businesses supporting the exchange of
    cryptocurrency to fiat are classified as digital currency exchanges and are required
    to comply with the AML laws and regulations under the Anti-Money Laundering and
    Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Holman and Stettner [2018](#CR39)). This
    implies that digital currency exchange providers are required to register with
    the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) to operate, and
    they have to implement KYC processes to adequately verify their customers’ identity,
    with ongoing obligations to monitor and report suspicious and threshold transactions.
    Exchange operators are also required to keep records relating to customer identification
    and transactions for seven years.

    constrained when adopting blockchain’s distributed ledger technology (DLT) to
    provide their services because of specific regulations on the banking industry
    or more general regulations that can limit its use in some banking processes and
    areas (ESMA [2016](#CR24)). First, a recurring argument concerns blockchain’s
    compliance with existing data protection laws and the consequent privacy and security
    issues (e.g. when using blockchain to share customers’ data during KYC processes).
    Data protection is a hot topic and a big challenge for those using new technologies
    such as blockchain; several regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) in the EU, are in place to ensure that customers’ personal data are kept
    safe and used only for legitimate purposes (Finck [2019](#CR32); PwC [2019](#CR48)).
    Another major issue is the uncertainty about the legal status of smart contracts
    (e.g. when used in trade finance), which generates some legal and regulatory issues
    related particularly to liability, jurisdiction, amendments and the voidability
    of contracts (Lauslahti et al. [2017](#CR43); Gatteschi et al. [2018](#CR36);
    Giudici and Adhami [2019](#CR37)). The problems mentioned above may render the
    operation of blockchain unlawful in some circumstances, thereby jeopardising its
    development. The EBA ([2019b](#CR16))^([24](#Fn24)) indicates some of the main
    challenges for the development of blockchain technology in EU banks: compliance
    with the existing EU regulatory framework (in particular, certain requirements
    of the GDPR), the uncertainties regarding the legal value of smart contracts and
    the lack of a clearly applicable jurisdiction, among others. Consequently, countries
    that are embracing blockchain’s DLTs have started to face such regulatory issues

    existing regulatory frameworks, to ease the aforementioned problems. The following
    subsections give an overview of the different approaches that regulators have
    undertaken to embrace blockchain technology.

    is its compliance with existing data protection law. In the EU context, data protection
    enjoys the status of a fundamental right as set up in Article 8 of the Charter
    of Fundamental Rights, which provides that everyone has the right to protect their
    personal data. The GDPR,^([25](#Fn25)) which was ratified in 2016 and fully implemented
    in 2018, establishes a detailed legislative framework that harmonises data protection
    across the EU, strengthens a wide range of existing rights and establishes new
    ones for individuals. Specifically, the GDPR creates some obligations for data
    controllers, which are the entities determining the means and purpose of data
    processing, but also grants data subjects (i.e. the natural persons to whom the
    personal data relate) a set of rights that give them more control over how their
    personal data are processed and can be enforced against data controllers. Some
    of these provisions can generate tensions with the nature, technical specificities
    and governance design of blockchain technology (Lyons et al. [2019](#CR46)). In
    particular, a study by Finck ([2019](#CR32))^([26](#Fn26)) relates these tensions
    to two overarching factors. First, the GDPR is based on the underlying assumption
    that, in relation to each personal data point, there is at least one natural or
    legal person (i.e. the data controller) whom data subjects can contact to enforce
    their rights under EU data protection law. Conversely, blockchain seeks to achieve
    decentralisation by replacing a unitary actor with many different players, which
    makes it a challenge to allocate responsibility and accountability. Second, the
    GDPR is based on the assumption that data can be modified or erased (i.e. the
    right to erasure)^([27](#Fn27)) where necessary to comply with legal requirements
    such as Articles 16 and 17 of the GDPR. This may not be technically feasible for
    the records/data stored on the blockchain (EBA [2019b](#CR16)). As discussed in
    Chapter [2](490216_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml), a key characteristic of blockchain technology
    is the irreversibility of records (immutability), which renders such modifications
    of data purposefully onerous. Although this study leads to the conclusion that
    the compatibility of blockchain with the GDPR should be assessed on a case-by-case
    basis,^([28](#Fn28)) it also shows that the interplay between the GDPR and blockchain
    is complex.

    have recognised the challenges posed by the relationship between blockchain and
    the implementation of the GDPR and have started to address them. For instance,
    the European Parliament invited the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)^([29](#Fn29))
    to issue guidelines and recommendations to ensure that blockchain technology complies
    with EU law. Although no guidelines had been issued by the time of this writing
    (October 2020), the EDPB had included blockchain as one of the possible topics
    to cover in its Work Program 2019/2020.

    scope is still unclear. To date, no specific smart contract legal regimes have
    been created at the supranational or the Member State level, except for Italy,
    which has explicitly addressed regulatory issues concerning smart contracts by
    introducing a legal definition of smart contracts (and DLTs) and recognising their
    full legal validity and enforceability in the country.^([30](#Fn30)) Although
    no regulatory framework has been developed at the EU level, EU authorities have
    acknowledged the importance of promoting legal certainty for smart contracts and
    the need to further assess the risks related to their use. For instance, the EC
    commissioned a consortium^([31](#Fn31)) to analyse and evaluate the legal framework
    in the EU with regard to blockchain technology and its applications like smart
    contracts. The study identified several legal issues, including the application
    of contract law,^([32](#Fn32)) smart contracts’ cross-border dimensions, the national
    legal requirements to have a written form of the contract and the application
    of consumer law, among others. However, the study’s results point to the conclusion
    that no specific action has to be taken at this stage to address the aforementioned
    issues, suggesting the commission adopt a wait-and-see approach and develop regulatory
    guidance on specific issues concerning smart contracts (e.g. how exactly consumer
    protection law applies to smart contracts). Although such guidance has yet to
    be issued, one of the EC objectives is to propose a comprehensive pro-innovation
    legal framework in the area of smart contracts to promote legal certainty.

    regulatory concerns surrounding its adoption. Nevertheless, the consideration
    above has led to the conclusion that further action is needed to generate more
    legal certainty since a clear regulatory regime is key to allowing a wider adoption
    of blockchain technology in compliance with existing EU laws.

    the union, the US regulatory framework on blockchain is fragmented, with each
    state adopting a different approach: some states have enacted laws allowing the
    use of blockchain technology and its applications in several contexts, while others
    have only started to evaluate its impact and their ability to leverage the technology.'

    laws, it is worth noting that the US has not implemented a comprehensive federal
    data protection framework but relies instead on state and sector-specific privacy
    and data security laws and regulations. There is not one piece of data protection
    legislation but several laws enacted at both the federal (e.g. the Federal Trade
    Commission Act) and the state level to protect US residents’ personal data (Chabinsky
    and Pittman [2020](#CR11)), which often applies to specific industry sectors (e.g.
    the Gramm Leach Bliley Act governing the protection of personal information in
    the hands of banks, insurance companies and other companies in the financial services
    industry). As a result, there is also not one single regulatory approach to the
    relationship between blockchain and data protection in the US. An example worth
    mentioning comes from the state of California, which addresses the relationship
    between blockchain and the state-level data protection law, the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA) (Cal. Civil Code § 1798.100 et seq.) became effective in January
    2020.^([33](#Fn33)) In 2018, an assembly bill led to the creation of a blockchain
    technology working group to evaluate the uses, risks, benefits and legal implications
    of blockchain and to recommend amendments to existing laws that may be impacted
    by blockchain.^([34](#Fn34)) With specific regard to data privacy legislation,
    the study’s main conclusion was that California’s privacy laws need not be amended
    to enable the adoption of blockchain technologies and use cases. However, it also
    suggested continuously monitoring pending legislation for potential new issues
    with blockchain applications related to the protection of individuals’ privacy
    that are not addressed by the existing regulatory framework and to take further
    action (e.g. by issuing guidance on how to deploy blockchain in a manner that
    comports with California privacy laws) to generate more legal certainty on the
    argument.

    enforceable under general federal contract law principles in the United States.
    According to a study by the Chamber of Digital Commerce ([2018](#CR12)), insofar
    as smart contract technology is used in the terms of a legal contract, existing
    law and traditional legal analysis already apply and ensure efficacy. Its study
    demonstrates that existing law in the form of the Electronic Signatures in Global
    and National Commerce Act (“ESIGN Act”) and the Uniform Electronic Transactions
    Act (“UETA”)^([35](#Fn35)) currently provide a sufficient legal basis for smart
    contracts using the terms of a legal contract to be regarded as legally binding
    once it is electronically signed. However, although there are strong arguments
    that existing state laws already provide a sound basis for the enforceability
    of smart contracts, several states (e.g. Arizona, Tennessee, Vermont, etc.) have
    also legislated in this respect. Some states have amended their laws to allow
    for the enforceability of blockchain-based contracts, and many other states have
    enacted laws that recognise blockchain technology and blockchain-based legal instruments.
    Some examples include the state of Arizona, which, in 2017, amended its version
    of the UETA, the Arizona Electronic Transaction Act (AETA), to legally recognise
    blockchain-secured records, signatures and smart contracts: “a contract relating
    to a transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely
    because that contract contains a smart contract term”.^([36](#Fn36)) More recently,
    in January 2020, the state of Illinois passed the Blockchain Technology Act (BTA),
    a law directly targeting blockchain technology and smart contract enforceability.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    since existent laws already provide a sufficient legal foundation for the enforcement
    of these types of agreements, many parties (Chamber of Digital Commerce [2018](#CR12);
    Levi et al. [2020](#CR44)) argue that additional legislation could create inconsistent
    state laws, confuse the marketplace and potentially hinder innovation. For instance,
    as Levi et al. ([2020](#CR44)) suggest, as a growing number of states are adopting
    different definitions for the same terms, the potential for disputes between parties
    relying on smart contracts increases, and the determination of which state’s law
    governs becomes more important. This points to the need for a uniform approach
    to regulate blockchain technology and smart contracts in order to avoid conflicting
    laws that may jeopardise the development of the technology.

    China has been increasingly involved in the blockchain arena to advance innovation
    across the country. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and other government agencies
    have consistently shown great enthusiasm for the application of blockchain technology
    and have undertaken several initiatives in terms of technical implementation and
    regulatory reforms to support research and development in this sector. For instance,
    in January 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC)—China’s cyberspace
    information regulator—released its Administrative Provisions on Blockchain Information
    Services (Blockchain Provisions), a set of rules governing blockchain-based information
    services that set out certain requirements for blockchain service providers^([37](#Fn37))
    to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the country (Zhang
    [2019](#CR54)). With specific regard to the financial services industry, in February
    2020, the PBOC released the financial industry standard “JR/T 0184—2020 Financial
    Distributed Ledger Technology Security Specification” to provide a common base
    standard for the development of financial services using DLTs. Specifically, this
    standard aims to help financial institutions to deploy and maintain systems in
    accordance with the relevant security requirements and provide business assurance
    capability and information security risk constraint capability for the large-scale
    application of DLT. To this end, it addresses various aspects of such systems,
    including policy and technical requirements, privacy protection principles and
    regulatory issues on smart contracts.

    several initiatives to encourage its use (González [2018](#CR38)). Japanese authorities
    have addressed blockchain-related regulatory issues. However, no blockchain-specific
    regulatory framework currently exists in Japan, nor have any specific laws been
    amended to address the regulatory concerns deriving from the adoption of blockchain
    technology. Among the different initiatives, it is worth mentioning the interest
    of Japanese authorities in implementing regulatory sandboxes to promote the development
    and usage of blockchain technology and other new technologies (e.g. AI, IoT and
    big data). For instance, in June 2018, a cross-governmental one-stop desk for
    a regulatory sandbox scheme in Japan was established within the Japan Economic
    Revitalization Bureau to enable companies that apply and receive approval to carry
    out (under certain conditions) a demonstration of their projects, even if such
    activities are not yet covered under current laws and regulations (Kawai and Sasaki
    [2020](#CR42)). The FSA also established its own sandboxes on different areas
    in fintech and, in 2017, launched the “FinTech PoC (Proof-of-Concept) Hub”. With
    specific regard to blockchain technology, the experiment concerns KYC information
    sharing via blockchain, which consisted of using blockchain to jointly implement
    a customer identity verification system for financial institutions. These regulatory
    sandboxes allow Japanese regulators to stay abreast of new business ideas and
    products and to learn where they might need to update or fill gaps in existing
    regulatory frameworks (González [2018](#CR38)).

    DLT (Reeves and Shen [2020](#CR49)). However, the country’s government agencies
    have sought to clarify the regulatory issues affecting the implementation and
    use of blockchain, particularly in the financial sector. To outline its regulatory
    framework, the ASIC released an information sheet (INFO 219—Evaluating distributed
    ledger technology) in March 2017 for both existing licensees and start-up businesses
    considering operating market infrastructure or providing financial or consumer
    credit services using DLT. In this information sheet, the ASIC re-asserted its
    “technology-neutral approach” to regulation and claimed that businesses using
    blockchain are subject to the compliance requirements that currently exist under
    the applicable licensing regime.^([38](#Fn38)) Moreover, according to the information
    sheet, the existing regulatory framework can accommodate the DLT use cases that
    have been observed. The ASIC has also established an Innovation Hub designed to
    help Australian fintech start-ups, including blockchain-related businesses, to
    navigate Australia’s regulatory system. Furthermore, the Australian government
    has engaged with industry and researchers to develop a National Blockchain Roadmap
    focused on several policy areas such as regulation, skill building, investment
    and international competitiveness and collaboration. This roadmap, published in
    February 2020, identifies a number of common regulatory issues across a large
    number of use cases^([39](#Fn39)) and lays out a strategy for governments, industry
    and researchers to tackle them by indicating some potential initiatives for the
    future.

    cryptocurrencies and those that result from banks adopting blockchain’s DLT to
    provide their services. The regulatory concerns around cryptocurrencies relate
    particularly to their use for illicit activities (e.g. fraud and manipulation,
    tax evasion, money laundering, etc.). Many countries have tried to regulate cryptocurrencies
    by taking different approaches: some have recognised cryptocurrencies and regulated
    their scope; others have prohibited them altogether; and still others have not
    taken any action at all. Although the initiatives that regulators have undertaken
    represent an important step to address cryptocurrencies risks, some concerns remain.
    As emphasised by the FSB ([2019a](#CR35)), the diversity of national regulatory
    responses and the consequent gaps, overlaps and conflicts that may occur among
    them may produce asymmetries across jurisdictions that can create significant
    loopholes for criminals and terrorists to abuse. This calls for an appropriate
    multilateral response and more coordination among regulators. International bodies
    are actively working on a variety of issues relating to crypto-assets, including
    investor and consumer protection, market integrity, bank exposures, AML/CFT, etc.,
    to provide a uniform approach.^([40](#Fn40))'

    its compliance with some existing laws (e.g. data protection laws) and the legal
    uncertainty surrounding smart contracts, both of which are significant barriers
    to blockchain adoption. Several regulatory initiatives have been undertaken to
    assess the need for new regulations or a modification of existing ones. Although
    some conflicts have been identified between existing regulatory framework and
    blockchain, the central argument, in many cases, is that the current legal framework
    can accommodate blockchain technology (particularly private blockchains) and its
    applications. However, certain issues still need to be addressed. In particular,
    more legal certainty is needed to reconcile existing laws (e.g. some aspects of
    data privacy laws) with blockchain, which does not necessarily imply changes to
    existing rules but at least guidance from the relevant authorities. Moreover,
    greater coordination among jurisdictions to provide a uniform approach to regulating
    blockchain is crucial to avoid conflicting laws that may jeopardise the adoption
    of blockchain in several contexts (e.g. the use of smart contracts in trade finance).
