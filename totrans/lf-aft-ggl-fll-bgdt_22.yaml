    guide their investments and companies. Space registers the geographical span of
    enterprise horizontally across the world; time projects the vertical dimension
    that takes the economy into the future. Money is a central metric to both, exchange
    rates mediating cross-border transactions, and interest rates guiding movement
    through time. When the signs and signals of time and space are muddled by government
    interventions or by arbitrary “caps” or controls, trade can founder, and the horizons
    of investment shrink in both dimensions.

    there is scant evidence of that. As futurists contemplate mining meteors or the

    on gold seems fanciful. The market issues its own judgment on this point, revealing
    no sign of “peak gold.” The existing supply of 187 kilotons of gold is split evenly

    a year for centuries, the stock of gold is huge compared with its flow. The amount

    in the nineteenth, have had a relatively small effect on prices. Accumulated supplies
    can shift between gold’s two main uses as money and jewelry. Money is liquid jewelry;
    jewelry is crystalized money. Raw bullion can be converted into baubles, and jewelry
    can be melted into coins, according to the needs of the economy registered by
    the price of gold. Mining output responds far more slowly.
