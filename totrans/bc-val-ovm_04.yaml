    cultivated, and curated across various social and service platforms, but sometimes
    created accidentally in the footprint of our Internet usage. Data patterns—pictures,

    our digital selves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are as individuals, how we spend our time, who and what we like and dislike, our
    preferences and quirks. That’s because we use the Internet for just about everything
    and our lives are increasingly digital and virtual. The idea that when we use
    the Internet, we consent to the use of the data we input is outdated. It made
    sense when we went online for just a few things: shopping, booking flights, even
    e-mailing. But today, we use the Internet for just about everything. It’s an extension
    of our physical space, our physical reality, and it mediates much, if not most,
    of our very existence. In fact, in 2019, you can hardly function as an active
    member of our society without the Internet. Our digital twin, then, captures not
    just our marketing demographics or preferences but all of what makes us human.'

    have agency over our physical selves or even our intellectual property. Why should
    a company’s collection, aggregation, or manipulation of data about us change the
    ownership or create new rights? When you take a picture of Picasso’s artwork,
    it’s still his art. That you just snapped a quick picture doesn’t mean you now
    own the image. Similarly, when you tell a friend a deeply personal secret, it’s
    still your secret. You would never expect that they would spread it—sell it, even—and
    claim that it became their information to share when you divulged it. Why should
    the way we think about our digital information be any different?
  prefs: []

    with “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” We can work every day, albeit
    for very long hours, but we can never be expected to surrender our liberty. No
    matter what the employer asks, we have the right to walk away at any time, subject
    to the terms of contract, but never with the prospect of losing our liberty hanging
    over our heads. Most of us exchange our time for a paycheck, and in doing so,
    voluntarily give up certain luxuries—waking up at noon or taking a 2-hour mid-day
    nap. But we are not legally forced to surrender our very liberty or right to selfhood
    to our employers. Our employers can’t jail us or enslave us. They can never own
    us.

    be no more enforceable than selling our selves. It should be negotiated, equitable,
    and entered freely.
  prefs: []

    the development of more sophisticated technologies to keep track of and manage
    our digital twins. Companies will be forced to compete in the creation and use
    of these technologies, and consumers will enjoy more choices of social platforms
    with different technologies and policies, and ultimately better services and more
    options.

    in social platforms. If you read a company’s terms of service and privacy policy,
    disagree and refuse to consent, what are your alternatives? You will be left behind
    in the digital revolution. If you’re a small company, and you don’t want to hand
    over your digital self to Facebook, you technically have the right to refuse their
    terms and not use their service. But without access to the most widely used sales
    and advertising platform, your business will not be able to survive, much less
    compete. Have you noticed that a meaningful alternative to LinkedIn, Facebook,
    or Amazon does not exist? Where would you go if LinkedIn one day decided to cancel
    your profile in the middle of a grueling job search? Would it not be devastating?
    Where else would employers find you?

    twins, we will encourage the development of meaningful alternatives to existing
    services. The main reason for such high barriers to entry for possible alternatives
    to these social platforms and services is that each existing company already controls
    so much territory and information. Each company is a monopoly in its own area,
    owning every part of our digital twin.
  prefs: []

    even if one existed.
  prefs: []

    time and energy into our profiles. We make decisions about which pictures to upload,
    with whom to share information, and what to comment on the posts of others. Creating

    owns his work. He made decisions on how to use that paint, and those decisions

    There’s no sustainable business model for continued revenue because the creator
    is cut off from the data related to the audience behavior and revenue reporting.
    You are also decoupled from IP because you signed away your rights for, say, 15
    years. There was a problem in our business models from independent content creators’
    perspective; we are learning intrinsically what blockchain technology could provide.

    can track and monetize their IP. Consider a film. I knew I would be able to see

    data on your audience and, most importantly, own the data and benefit firsthand

    content, but it’s doubtful that you’re going to be able to see a return on that
    content. Your investors are not going to see their return. Most importantly, you
    can’t even provide them with any transparent accounting to show them that there
    was an activity because you have been completely cut off from it. Essentially,
    what we saw was an opportunity to build a distribution platform for content creators
    that operated the same way. We know through market research that audiences don’t
    care where they find content, be it a movie or a piece of music—they want ease.
    They want it when they want it, where they want it. They don’t care if it’s on

    because you, as a content creator, are the one who gets to benefit, and now you
    can create a business model based on it. Whether you’re an individual artist,
    a production company, or especially a studio with large accounting overhead, you’re
    able to have this peer-to-peer transparent accounting, IP tracking, and data collection,
    and you own it. That is powerful; it is one of our business models, and that is
    what we are building. We are still a start-up. We’ve been in business for about
    2 years now, and we only launched our beta product to the world in January. Now

    is used to ‘paying the man?’ How do we get them to care about a local exchange
    and a peer-to-peer exchange? Out of the gate, the data and the marketing say they
    don’t care. They want to come home, get a glass of wine, and watch what they want

    British blockchain start-up JAAK[9](13_ch04.xhtml#ch04en9) is developing an Ethereum-based
    platform that allows media owners to convert their repository of media, metadata,
    and rights into “smart content” that can self-execute licensing transactions (CB

    violin, and registered objects, like houses, cars, and boats, which live on a
    government register. The same object can be both. For example, cars are both serialized
    and registered property. In fact, almost everything that is registered is serialized
    as well. The idea is that you take this object and put it in a smart contract.
    The goal is to have the owner in smart contracts make changes in the real world
    to legally transfer ownership.'

    Mattereum’s registrars, the violin would be not just a physical asset but a digital
    asset as well. Then it could be programmatically tokenized and sold to multiple
    investors. Thus, the contractual restrictions regarding its use could be required
    and enforced. Rather than staying locked away in a vault, it could be used to
    bring joy to the ears of many, with Mattereum managing how many times it’s played

    scheme. He’s got a pool of resources to make decisions. And those little buffers
    are all over the physical world. There are many of these little schemes where
    you’ve got a small pool of resources informally controlled. They are handed out
    to cover the kind of errors in the material world. It’s not that somebody has

    simpler ones: who owns what exists on the blockchain; some normative questions
    like who *should* own what exists on the blockchain? But when we think expansively,
    we can see that it’s not just our own selves being tokenized for security and
    efficiency but our actions and transactions as well. When a creator is closer
    to the object of their creation, they maintain control and cut out the inefficiencies
    of the proverbial “middleman.” From lawyers, to artists, to asset managers, a
    range of actors in the global economy stand to gain from the new conceptions of
    ownership possible with blockchain.'
