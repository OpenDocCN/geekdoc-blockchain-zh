    because it is outside their control. The central control point or intermediary
    can become extremely powerful—and can misuse that power. If, on the other hand,
    each organization keeps its own ledger (as with most corporate financial records),
    every transaction is recorded independently at least twice. Whenever, for example,
    a company pays a vendor or a bank cashes a check from another bank’s customer,
    their ledgers must be synchronized after the fact. This introduces complexity,

    and smart contracts took it even further. A second dimension is what it means
    to talk of the blockchain as a new architecture of trust. Trust is a deeply powerful
    phenomenon. Its subtleties are often missed despite a centuries-long history of
    intellectual discourse over the concept. The blockchain purports to create trust
    without trusting. The truth is more complicated (but no less interesting). A third
    dimension of the story concerns the business implications of the blockchain phenomenon.
    Despite an excess of hype and a speculative frenzy, there are significant, real
    value propositions for distributed ledger technology. Yet the scope of the blockchain

- en: This story will take us around the world, from frantic efforts on three continents
    to respond to a catastrophic cybertheft, to Chinese farms supplying multinational
    retailers, to a brilliant but conflicted British engineer working at Google’s
    Zurich office, and many places in between. Developments are so fast-moving that
    some examples will likely be outdated by the time you read this book. The start-ups
    prominent today may not be the long-term survivors. Yet there are also timeless
    themes in play. Viewing the blockchain story as a tale of trust, not just technology,
    helps to separate the enduring aspects from the ephemeral.

- en: The blockchain can seem like an alien technology or an artifact from the future
    that inexplicably surfaced in the present. Situating it as an engine of law and
    trust helps anchor the phenomenon. How well systems based on blockchain-related
    technology realize its vast potential will depend on how well they address deep,
    familiar challenges.

- en: Two weeks after the surrender of the last Confederate army marked the end of
    the Civil War, the buttonwood tree of Wall Street fell down during a storm. By
    then, it was a well-known landmark and a symbol of the rise of the U.S. as a global
    financial power. Much had changed in the four score minus seven years since those
    stockbrokers signed their agreement. A nation then not far removed from its founding
    was now emerging from its most harrowing conflict. Much more would change in the
    subsequent century and a half. The trust that was useful when the whole Wall Street
    community fit into a coffeehouse is quite different than what is needed today.

    defining the newest architecture of trust. Blockchains are organized using a mathematical
    structure of branching nodes. It is called a “hash tree” or “Merkle tree,” as
    shown in [figure 0.3](#fig0-3).

    The cryptographer Ralph Merkle filed a patent on the concept in 1979\. The expiration
    of the patent in 2002 allowed developers to incorporate the concept freely into
    open-source software. Six years later, this was one of the preexisting technologies
    that Satoshi Nakamoto assembled to create Bitcoin. Where the original tree served
    to mark a convenient meeting spot, this one stitches together a reliable digital
    record from a cacophony of independent voices. Whether its significance matches
    that of its predecessor remains to be seen.

- en: A “blockchain” (sometimes rendered as “block chain”) is a data storage system
    using linked sequential chunks of information. It is literally a chain of blocks
    designed to create an immutable ledger of transactions. What I call a “blockchain
    network” or “blockchain system” is the collection of computers running software
    that maintains a blockchain in a consistent state called “consensus.” “Distributed
    ledger” is a more general term for blockchains and similar consensus-based systems.
    “The blockchain” is something of a misnomer. However, it is used in a generic
    sense, like “the Internet,” to describe the universe of distributed ledger networks.

- en: “Cryptocurrency” is a currency based on cryptography rather than central-bank
    control of the money supply. Some regulators prefer to call systems like Bitcoin
    “virtual currencies,” arguing that a “digital currency” must be denominated in
    a traditional government-issued “fiat” currency.^([23](#fm7-23)) Virtual currency,
    however, includes many pre-Bitcoin systems with only limited connection to money,
    such as frequent-flyer miles and reward points for video games. Cryptocurrencies
    have the essential features of fiat currency but operate without government involvement.
    Therefore, I prefer the approach of the Bank for International Settlements, which
    recognized “digital currency” as the prevailing term.^([24](#fm7-24)) Finally,
    Bitcoin is capitalized when describing the network, but not when referring to
    the unit of currency, as with dollars or yuan.
