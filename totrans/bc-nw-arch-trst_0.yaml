    in one location does so everywhere. Think of the dual-pen tool called a “polygraph”
    (no connection to the lie detector) that Thomas Jefferson used to make copies
    of his correspondence, as shown in [figure 0.2](#fig0-2). With a polygraph, the
    copy is created in parallel with the original. There is no need for a third party
    to transcribe the author’s words. The blockchain and related approaches extend
    that model to many copies distributed physically and operationally.

    synchronized. Maintaining that consensus without trusting a master copy is the
    hard part. If successful, this approach addresses significant limitations of centralized
    ledgers. If one node keeps a master record, it becomes a single point of failure
    for the system. Users cannot be certain that the information they see is accurate
    because it is outside their control. The central control point or intermediary
    can become extremely powerful—and can misuse that power. If, on the other hand,
    each organization keeps its own ledger (as with most corporate financial records),
    every transaction is recorded independently at least twice. Whenever, for example,
    a company pays a vendor or a bank cashes a check from another bank’s customer,
    their ledgers must be synchronized after the fact. This introduces complexity,
    delay, and possibilities for error.

    came from, how it works, and what it makes possible. One dimension of the story
    is technical. The blockchain realized the long-sought dream of digital cash through
    Satoshi Nakamoto’s clever design, and extensions such as permissioned ledgers
    and smart contracts took it even further. A second dimension is what it means
    to talk of the blockchain as a new architecture of trust. Trust is a deeply powerful
    phenomenon. Its subtleties are often missed despite a centuries-long history of
    intellectual discourse over the concept. The blockchain purports to create trust
    without trusting. The truth is more complicated (but no less interesting). A third
    dimension of the story concerns the business implications of the blockchain phenomenon.
    Despite an excess of hype and a speculative frenzy, there are significant, real
    value propositions for distributed ledger technology. Yet the scope of the blockchain
    opportunity reveals the gaps that the technology alone cannot overcome. There
    have already been several incidents where the promise of distributed trust broke

    in the 1990s, it raised strikingly similar questions about the relationship of
    law to decentralized online communities. Legal scholars offered strikingly similar
    responses to participants in today’s blockchain debates. Then as now, the best
    answer is neither celebration of technology’s primacy nor dismissal of its power.

    law and distributed ledgers, from both directions. Some are already under development;
    others will require collective action to address potential problems before they
    become endemic. The final chapter of the book considers how, if it succeeds as
    the foundation for a new trust architecture, the blockchain might reinvigorate
    the Internet itself. The Internet as it developed became part of the problem rather
    than the solution to the spreading trust crisis in society. Although it will not
    close the yawning trust gap by itself, the blockchain offers a new hope. Realizing
    that hope will require both technology innovators and governments to make good
    decisions. That can happen only with a solid understanding of how the blockchain

    “The blockchain” is something of a misnomer. However, it is used in a generic
    sense, like “the Internet,” to describe the universe of distributed ledger networks.

  zh: “区块链”（有时被写作“区块链”）是一种使用链接的序列信息的数据存储系统。它字面上是由区块组成的链条，旨在创建一个不可篡改的交易账本。我所说的“区块链网络”或“区块链系统”是由运行维护区块链一致状态软件的计算机集合。“分布式账本”是对区块链及其类似共识系统的更一般术语。“区块链”这个词有点误导。然而，它像“互联网”一样，被广泛用来描述分布式账本网络的宇宙。
- en: “Cryptocurrency” is a currency based on cryptography rather than central-bank
    control of the money supply. Some regulators prefer to call systems like Bitcoin
    “virtual currencies,” arguing that a “digital currency” must be denominated in
    a traditional government-issued “fiat” currency.^([23](#fm7-23)) Virtual currency,
    however, includes many pre-Bitcoin systems with only limited connection to money,
    such as frequent-flyer miles and reward points for video games. Cryptocurrencies
    have the essential features of fiat currency but operate without government involvement.
    Therefore, I prefer the approach of the Bank for International Settlements, which
    recognized “digital currency” as the prevailing term.^([24](#fm7-24)) Finally,
    Bitcoin is capitalized when describing the network, but not when referring to
    the unit of currency, as with dollars or yuan.

  zh: “加密货币”是一种基于密码学而不是中央银行对货币供应控制的货币。一些监管机构更喜欢将比特币这样的系统称为“虚拟货币”，他们认为“数字货币”必须是传统政府发行的“法定”货币。^([23](#fm7-23))然而，虚拟货币包括许多与货币联系有限的比特币之前的系统，如常旅客里程和视频游戏的奖励点数。加密货币具有法定货币的基本特征，但运作不涉及政府。因此，我更喜欢国际清算银行的做法，它将“数字货币”视为通用的术语。^([24](#fm7-24))最后，在描述网络时“比特币”大写，但在提到货币单位时，如美元或人民币，则小写。
