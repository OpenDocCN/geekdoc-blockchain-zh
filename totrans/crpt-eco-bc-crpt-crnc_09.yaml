- en: The rapid development of blockchain and the crypto economy has attracted a lot
    of attention from hackers. We’ve reviewed some prominent examples. ICO token sales
    are usually the “sweet spot” for hackers. As I mentioned, the DAO is a great example
    of this. Exchanges themselves are now targeted by hackers. Suffice to say, security
    is going to be absolutely critical to the next stage of token economy. In this
    chapter, we will discuss the security solutions that will be required to address
    these issues.

    blockchains give their operators control over who has access to the information
    stored in the chains. Public blockchains, in contrast, are open to everyone. Because
    of their prevalence and dominance, I will mostly be focusing on the security issues
    related to public blockchains.

    stronger and defending assets on blockchain. I’d like to begin by looking at two
    approaches.

    contracts has created some openings through which bad actors can sometimes enter
    and cause trouble. Bitcoin and Ethereum are supported on public blockchains, which
    have a higher defensive ability, but when it comes to smart contracts, the shorter,
    less complex codes involved can make them more hackable. The upshot is, of course,
    that smart contracts become the #1 target for hackers.'

    three main limitations:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Primarily, in most cases, the coding of a smart contract is open-source, which
    means that all the DAPPs coding sources are available to the public. Everyone
    can see who created the codes. Accordingly, a hacker can try to take advantage
    of this public information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The irreversibility of the smart contract is another limit. This quality makes
    it harder to take care of a mess after the fact because the smart contract will
    always execute terms. It is very hard to change the terms in a smart contract
    once it has been released into blockchain. It is also incredibly expensive to
    do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final limitation comes from the fact that many vulnerabilities and loopholes
    are driven by “rookie mistakes.” Not all DAPPs feature state-of-the-art design.
    With any DAPP, you may find mistakes after it is already up and running. And since
    the smart contract is not reversible, the original design of a DAPP has to be
    seamless, which is almost impossible to accomplish. For example, users of Cashierest,
    a South Korean crypto exchange, found out that they could withdraw up to five
    times the amount they’d requested from the exchange. This bug was caused by an
    internal system error affecting withdrawals. Foxbit, a Brazilian exchange, also
    experienced a notable bug. Users found that they could change their two-factor
    authentication settings using only one password, which made it easier for hackers
    to lock genuine users out of their accounts. There was no email confirmation,
    no security question, no other security protection. And in the end, it was very
    easy for hackers to withdraw the users’ funds.

    systems. It wants to improve security by providing smart contracts and blockchain
    ecosystems that are bug-free and hacker-resistant. Since it is almost impossible
    to correct mistakes once a smart contract has been put into execution, it is critical
    to make sure the design of the smart contract is perfect. Certik has developed
    a “layer-based approach” that takes the prohibitive large proofing and quality-check
    tasks and turns them into smaller ones.

    programming languages, operating systems, and certified software. He and his group
    at Yale have also developed the world’s first hacker-resistant concurrent operating
    system, CertiKOS, which can build cyber-physical systems that are probably free
    from software vulnerabilities.

    users the freedom to do transactions across national boundaries and without interference
    from intermediaries. But on the other hand, as we’ve seen, its lack of an adequate
    defense system often poses a threat to users and their assets. If you deposit
    your cash with Chase and it’s somehow stolen from your account, the bank will
    take care of it. Chase will use its centralized system to trace the money and
    get it back for you. (And if they somehow fail to do this, you could go to the
    police and report the theft.) But in the decentralized world, it would be a different
    scenario because of the nature of anonymity. Sentinel Protocol is attempting to
    step in to fill that security vacuum.

    world of blockchain security, user experience, and individual user protection.

    for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The remaining security problems at this point mostly
    lie within applications, with DAPP, and with individual end users. Consumers need
    new, adaptable methods to solve their remaining security problems. This is the
    mission of Sentinel Protocol. According to their latest white paper, Sentinel
    is now developing three products intended to address the most pressing security
    issues remaining for the decentralized world. The products are Threat Reputation
    Database (TRDB), S-Wallet, and D-Sandbox.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TRDB operates by collecting threat data from many different sources, including
    cryptocurrency exchanges, virtual wallets, payment services, and even IT and security
    companies. It is a little like a Wikipedia for collectable threat data. For example,
    such information can be the wallet address of hackers, a Malicious URL, phishing
    websites, or anything similar. TRDB is only updated by authorized experts, which
    allows it to maintain the highest levels of precision. However, regular users
    can also participate in the data collecting process by allowing automatic reporting,
    as well as submitting information manually. In addition, TRDB is constantly honed
    through consultations with experts in information security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TRDB is basically designed to solve two safety-related issues. One concerns
    the central server. Since everything is stored in one location under a central
    server format, it’s easy to hack and easy to manipulate and abuse. The Internet
    is designed to have “User to Server” or “ Server to User” functions. TRBD seeks
    to avoid hacks and keeps server information flowing smoothly and safely. The other
    issue it addresses is the lack of communication among security providers and Internet
    security software companies. The more information on a threat that’s collected,
    the less chance it has of resulting in a cybercrime. But since every Internet
    security company keeps its security data to itself, the benefits of building a
    shared database are not realized. TRDB allows this sharing safely and efficiently.

- en: S-Wallet is a self-defense wallet. It keeps users safe by filtering transactions
    against wallet addresses with a history of scams. It also filters out Malicious
    URLs, URIs, and Malware. Just as TRDB collects information regarding threats,
    S-Wallet collects information allowing users to defend themselves against potential
    risk.

- en: Distributed Malware Sandboxing, also known as D-Sandbox, is another important
    and innovative safety mechanism. It independently tests for suspicious and unidentified
    files or links by running virtual machines (VM) on decentralized nodes. This enhances
    security, prevents hacks, and closes potential ways in for cybercriminals.

- en: The current lack of regulation requires ICO investors to do the homework themselves
    when it comes to security. There are still ways that blockchain-related investments
    can be vulnerable to cybercrime. Yet dedicated investors who are truly passionate
    about cryptocurrency and blockchain will find ways to ensure that safety and security
    keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in this industry. Hacking, Internet
    fraud, and phishing can infect an ICO at almost any stage. For example, some hackers
    might build a phishing website that looks exactly like the real ICO website in
    order to fool potential investors. Because of tactics like this, protective measures
    will always be necessary. Sentinel Protocol is providing powerful and meaningful
    solutions in this area. In the near future, Sentinel Protocol hopes to work with
    exchanges to assist governments in detecting criminal money laundering. (Their
    product known as Anti-Coin-Solution, or ACM, is specifically designed for this
    task.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certik and Sentinel Protocol are great examples of the constant, ongoing efforts
    that are required to effectively resolve security issues in blockchain and cryptocurrency—and,
    at the same time, to build a new blockchain ecosystem with the highest levels
    of security. Forging this new, safer future will require experts in computer science,
    data analysis, and decentralized ledger technology. The decentralized world is
    still at a sort of “starting point.” Though some very talented people are already
    on the job, we need to ensure that this world be appealing to the next generation
    of security experts. But I don’t think that will be a difficult sale to make.
    Truly, blockchain is where all the opportunities are.
