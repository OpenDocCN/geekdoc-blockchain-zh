- en: The rapid development of blockchain and the crypto economy has attracted a lot
    of attention from hackers. We’ve reviewed some prominent examples. ICO token sales
    are usually the “sweet spot” for hackers. As I mentioned, the DAO is a great example
    of this. Exchanges themselves are now targeted by hackers. Suffice to say, security
    is going to be absolutely critical to the next stage of token economy. In this
    chapter, we will discuss the security solutions that will be required to address
    these issues.

- en: Both private blockchains and public blockchains have security issues. Private
    blockchains give their operators control over who has access to the information

    of their prevalence and dominance, I will mostly be focusing on the security issues
    related to public blockchains.

    have a higher defensive ability, but when it comes to smart contracts, the shorter,

    that smart contracts become the #1 target for hackers.'

  zh: 区块链被设计成无法被黑客攻击。然而，智能合约的参与创造了一些漏洞，通过这些漏洞，不良分子有时可以进入并制造麻烦。比特币和以太坊建立在公共区块链上，具有更高的防御能力，但是当涉及到智能合约时，涉及的代码越短，越简单，越容易受到攻击。结果当然是智能合约成为黑客的首要目标。

    three main limitations:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 与传统软件安全相比，区块链安全存在三个主要局限：
- en: Primarily, in most cases, the coding of a smart contract is open-source, which
    means that all the DAPPs coding sources are available to the public. Everyone
    can see who created the codes. Accordingly, a hacker can try to take advantage
    of this public information.
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，在大多数情况下，智能合约的编码是开源的，这意味着所有DAPPs的编码源都对公众可用。每个人都可以看到谁创建了这些代码。相应地，黑客可以尝试利用这些公开信息。
- en: The irreversibility of the smart contract is another limit. This quality makes
    it harder to take care of a mess after the fact because the smart contract will
    always execute terms. It is very hard to change the terms in a smart contract
    once it has been released into blockchain. It is also incredibly expensive to
    do.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 智能合约的不可逆性是另一个限制。这一特性使得事后的清理更加困难，因为智能合约总是会执行条款。一旦智能合约发布到区块链上，要更改智能合约中的条款非常困难。这样做也非常昂贵。
- en: The final limitation comes from the fact that many vulnerabilities and loopholes
    are driven by “rookie mistakes.” Not all DAPPs feature state-of-the-art design.
    With any DAPP, you may find mistakes after it is already up and running. And since
    the smart contract is not reversible, the original design of a DAPP has to be
    seamless, which is almost impossible to accomplish. For example, users of Cashierest,
    a South Korean crypto exchange, found out that they could withdraw up to five
    times the amount they’d requested from the exchange. This bug was caused by an
    internal system error affecting withdrawals. Foxbit, a Brazilian exchange, also
    experienced a notable bug. Users found that they could change their two-factor
    authentication settings using only one password, which made it easier for hackers
    to lock genuine users out of their accounts. There was no email confirmation,
    no security question, no other security protection. And in the end, it was very
    easy for hackers to withdraw the users’ funds.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后一个限制来自于这样一个事实：许多漏洞和漏洞都是由“新手错误”驱动的。并不是所有的DAPP都具备最先进的设计。对于任何DAPP，在它上线后你可能会发现错误。由于智能合约是不可逆的，因此DAPP的原始设计必须无缝，这几乎是不可能实现的。例如，韩国加密货币交易所Cashierest的用户发现他们可以从交易所提取多达五倍于请求金额的款项。这个错误是由影响提现的内部系统错误引起的。巴西交易所Foxbit也经历了一个显著的错误。用户发现他们可以用一个密码就更改他们的双因素认证设置，这使得黑客更容易把真实用户锁出他们的账户。没有电子邮件确认，没有安全问题，没有其他安全保护。最后，黑客很容易就提取了用户的资金。
- en: Certik is a formal verification platform for smart contracts and blockchain
    systems. It wants to improve security by providing smart contracts and blockchain
    ecosystems that are bug-free and hacker-resistant. Since it is almost impossible
    to correct mistakes once a smart contract has been put into execution, it is critical
    to make sure the design of the smart contract is perfect. Certik has developed
    a “layer-based approach” that takes the prohibitive large proofing and quality-check
    tasks and turns them into smaller ones.

    take care of it. Chase will use its centralized system to trace the money and

- en: TRDB operates by collecting threat data from many different sources, including
    cryptocurrency exchanges, virtual wallets, payment services, and even IT and security
    companies. It is a little like a Wikipedia for collectable threat data. For example,
    such information can be the wallet address of hackers, a Malicious URL, phishing
    websites, or anything similar. TRDB is only updated by authorized experts, which
    allows it to maintain the highest levels of precision. However, regular users
    can also participate in the data collecting process by allowing automatic reporting,
    as well as submitting information manually. In addition, TRDB is constantly honed
    through consultations with experts in information security.

    只由授权的专家更新，这使得它能够保持最高的精确度。然而，普通用户也可以通过允许自动报告以及手动提交信息的方式参与到数据收集过程中。此外，TRDB 通过与信息安全专家的咨询不断得到完善。
- en: TRDB is basically designed to solve two safety-related issues. One concerns
    the central server. Since everything is stored in one location under a central
    server format, it’s easy to hack and easy to manipulate and abuse. The Internet
    is designed to have “User to Server” or “ Server to User” functions. TRBD seeks
    to avoid hacks and keeps server information flowing smoothly and safely. The other
    issue it addresses is the lack of communication among security providers and Internet
    security software companies. The more information on a threat that’s collected,
    the less chance it has of resulting in a cybercrime. But since every Internet
    security company keeps its security data to itself, the benefits of building a
    shared database are not realized. TRDB allows this sharing safely and efficiently.

  zh: TRDB主要是为了解决两个与安全相关的问题。第一个问题涉及中心服务器。由于在中心服务器格式下，所有东西都存储在一个位置，因此容易被黑客攻击，容易被操纵和滥用。互联网被设计为具有“用户到服务器”或“服务器到用户”的功能。TRBD试图避免黑客攻击，并保持服务器信息流畅和安全地流动。它解决的另一个问题是安全提供商和互联网安全软件公司之间的沟通不足。收集的威胁信息越多，就越不可能导致网络犯罪。但是，由于每个互联网安全公司都将其安全数据保留给自己，建立共享数据库的好处并没有得到实现。TRDB允许安全高效地进行这种共享。
- en: S-Wallet is a self-defense wallet. It keeps users safe by filtering transactions
    against wallet addresses with a history of scams. It also filters out Malicious
    URLs, URIs, and Malware. Just as TRDB collects information regarding threats,
    S-Wallet collects information allowing users to defend themselves against potential
    risk.
