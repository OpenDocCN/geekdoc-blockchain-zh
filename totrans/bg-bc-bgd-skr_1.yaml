    that has already started to redesign business, social and political interactions,
    and any other way of value exchange. Again, it is not just a change, but a rapid
    phenomenon that is already in motion. As of this writing, more than 40 top financial
    institutions and many different firms across industries have started to explore
    blockchain to lower transaction cost, speed up transaction time, reduce the risk
    of fraud, and eliminate the middleman or intermediary services. Some are trying
    to reimagine legacy systems and services to take them to a new level and also
    come up with new kinds of service offerings.We will cover blockchain in greater
    detail throughout the book. You can follow through the chapters in the order presented
    if you are new to blockchain or pick only the ones relevant to you. This chapter
    explains what blockchain is all about, how it has evolved, and its importance
    in today’s world with some uses and use cases. It gives an outside-in perspective
    to you to be able to delve deeper into blockchain.

  zh: 区块链的背景故事
- en: 'One of the first known digital disruptions that laid the foundation of the
    Internet was TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) back in
    the 1970s. Prior to TCP/IP, it was the era of circuit switching, which required
    dedicated connection between two parties for communication to happen. TCP/IP came
    up with its packet switching design, which was more open and peer-to-peer with
    no need to preestablish a dedicated line between parties.When the Internet was
    made accessible to the public through the World Wide Web (WWW) in the early 1990s,
    it was supposed to be more open and peer-to- peer. This is because it was built
    atop the open and decentralized TCP/IP. When any new technology, especially the
    revolutionary ones, hits the market, either they fade away on their own, or they
    create such an impact that they become the accepted norm. People adapted to the
    WWW revolution and leveraged the benefits it had to offer in every possible way.
    As a result, the World Wide Web started shaping up in a way that might not have
    been the exact way it was imagined. It could have been more open, more accessible,
    and more peer-to-peer. Many new technologies and businesses started to build on
    top of it and it became what it is today—more centralized. Slowly and gradually,
    people get used to what technology offers. People are just fine if an international
    transaction takes days to settle, or it is too expensive, or it is less reliable.Let
    us take a closer look at the banking system and its evolution. Starting from the
    olden days of barter system till fiat currencies, there was no real difference
    between a transaction and its settlement because they were not two separate entities.
    As an example, if Alice had to pay $10 to Bob, she would just hand over a $10
    note to Bob and the transaction would just get settled there. No bank was needed
    to debit $10 from Alice’s account and credit the same to Bob’s account or to serve
    as a system of trust to ensure Alice does not cheat Bob. However, transacting
    directly with someone who is physically not present close by was difficult. So,
    banking systems evolved with many more service offerings and enabled transactions
    from every corner of the world. With the help of the Internet, geography was no
    more a limitation and banking became easier than ever. Not just banking for that
    matter: the Internet facilitated many different kinds of value exchange over the
    web.Technology enabled someone from India to make a monetary transaction with
    someone in the United Kingdom, but with some cost. It takes days to settle such
    transactions and is expensive as well. A bank was always needed to impose trust
    and ensure security for such transactions between two or more parties. What if
    technology could enable trust and security without these intermediary and centralized
    systems? Somehow, this part (of technology imposing trust) was missing all through,
    which resulted in development of centralized systems such as banks, escrow services,
    clearing houses, registrars and many other such institutions. Blockchain proves
    to be that missing piece of the Internet revolution puzzle that facilitates a
    trustless system in a cryptographically secured way.Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous
    name by which the world knows him, must have felt that the monetary systems were
    not touched by the technological revolution since the 1980s. Banks formed the
    centralized institutions that maintained the transaction records, governed interactions,
    enforced trust and security, and regulated the whole system. The whole of commerce
    relies on these financial institutions, which serve as the trusted third parties
    to process payments. The mediation of financial institutions increases cost and
    time to settle a transaction, and also limits the transaction sizes. The mediation
    was needed to settle disputes, but that meant that completely nonreversible transaction
    was never possible. This resulted in a situation where trust was needed for someone
    to transact with another. Certainly, this bureaucratic system had to change to
    keep up with the economy’s expected digital transformation. So, Satoshi invented
    a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin that was enabled by the underlying technology—
    blockchain. Bitcoin is just one monetary use case of blockchain that addresses
    the inherent weakness of trust-based models. We will delve deeper into the fundamentals
    of both Bitcoins and blockchain in this book.'

  zh: 在20世纪70年代，TCP/IP（传输控制协议/互联网协议）是第一个已知数字颠覆事件，它奠定了互联网的基础。在TCP/IP之前，是电路交换的时代，它需要两方之间建立专用的连接才能进行通信。TCP/IP提出了分组交换的设计，它更加开放，点对点，无需在各方之间预先建立专用的线路。当互联网在1990年代初通过万维网（WWW）对公众开放时，它本应该是更加开放和点对点的。这是因为它是建立在开放和去中心化的TCP/IP之上的。当任何新技术，尤其是革命性的技术，进入市场时，要么它们自己消失，要么它们产生如此大的影响，以至于它们成为被接受的规范。人们适应了万维网革命，并尽其可能地利用它提供的利益。结果，万维网开始形成可能并非完全如人们想象的方式。它本可以更加开放，更加易于访问，更加点对点。许多新技术和业务开始建立其之上，并变成了今天这样——更加集中。逐渐地，人们习惯了技术所提供的东西。如果国际交易需要数天才能结算，或者太贵，或者可靠性较低，人们都可以接受。让我们更仔细地看看银行系统及其演变。从古老的以物易物时代直到法定货币，交易和结算之间没有真正的区别，因为它们不是两个分开的实体。例如，如果爱丽丝需要支付10美元给鲍勃，她只需把一张10美元的钞票递给鲍勃，交易就在那里结算了。不需要银行从爱丽丝的账户中扣除10美元，并在鲍勃的账户中记入相同的金额，或者作为信任体系以确保爱丽丝不会欺骗鲍勃。然而，与附近身体不在场的人直接交易是困难的。因此，银行系统随着更多服务功能的推出而发展，使世界各地的交易变得可能。在互联网的帮助下，地理位置不再是限制，银行变得比以往任何时候都容易。不仅仅是银行业务：互联网使网上进行许多不同类型的价值交换变得可能。技术使来自印度的人能够与英国的人进行货币交易，但代价较高。这类交易需要数天时间来结算，并且成本高昂。银行总是需要强制信任，确保两方或多方之间的交易安全。如果技术能够在没有这些中介和集中系统的情况下实现信任和安全呢？不知何故，这个技术强制信任的部分一直缺失，这导致了银行、托管服务、清算所、注册机构等许多其他机构的集中系统的发展。区块链证明是互联网革命拼图中的缺失部分，它以一种加密安全的方式实现了一个无需信任的系统。中本聪，这个世界知道他的化名，可能觉得自1980年代以来，货币系统没有被技术革命触及。银行形成了维护交易记录、管理互动、强制信任和安全、规范整个系统的集中机构。整个商业都依赖于这些金融机构，它们作为处理支付的可信第三方。金融机构的调解增加了结算交易的成本和时间，同时也限制了交易规模。调解是为了解决争端，但这意味着完全不可撤销的交易是不可能的。这导致了一个局面，即需要信任才能使某人与另一个人交易。当然，这个官僚系统必须改变，以适应经济预期的数字转型。所以，中本聪发明了一种叫做比特币的加密货币，它是由底层技术——区块链所启用的。比特币只是区块链在货币方面的一个应用案例，它解决了基于信任模型的内在弱点。我们将在本书中深入探讨比特币和区块链的基础知识。

- en: The Internet has revolutionized many aspects of life, society, and business.
    However, we learned in the previous section that how people and organizations
    execute transactions with one another has not changed much in the past couple
    of decades. Blockchain is believed to be the component that completes the Internet
    puzzle and makes it more open, more accessible, and more reliable.To understand
    blockchain, you have to understand it from both a business perspective and technical
    perspective. Let us first understand it in a business transaction context to get
    the “what” of it, and then look into the technicality to understand the “how”
    of it in the following chapters.Blockchain is a system of records to transact
    value (not just money!) in a peer-to-peer fashion. What it means is that there
    is no need for a trusted intermediary such as banks, brokers, or other escrow
    services to serve as a trusted third party. For example, if Alice pays to Bob
    $10, why would it go through a bank? Take a look at Figure [1-1](#Fig1).![A440588_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-1Transaction through an intermediary vs. peer-to-peer transactionLet us look
    at a different example now. A typical stock transaction happens in seconds, but
    its settlement takes weeks. Is it desirable in this digital age? Certainly not!
    Figure [1-2](#Fig2) demonstrates the current situation.![A440588_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-2Stocks trading through an intermediary clearing houseIf someone wants to buy
    some stocks from a company or a person, they can just directly buy it from them
    with instant settlement, with no need for brokers, clearing houses, or other financial
    institutions in between. A decentralized and peer-to-peer solution to such a situation
    can be represented as in Figure [1-3](#Fig3).![A440588_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-3Peer-to-peer stock tradingPlease note that transaction and settlement are not
    two different entities in a blockchain setting! The transactions are analogous
    to, say, fiat currency transactions where if someone pays another a $10 note,
    they do not own it anymore and that $10 note is physically transferred to the
    new owner.Now that you understand blockchain from a functional perspective, at
    a high level, let us look into it a little technically, and the reason for naming
    it “blockchain” becomes clearer. We will see “What” it is technically and leave
    the “How” it works to Chapter [2](A440588_1_En_2_Chapter_split_000.xhtml).Read
    the following statements and do not worry if the concepts do not fit together
    well for your complete understanding. You may want to revisit it, but be patient
    till you finish reading this book.

    1-4The blockchain data structureEvery node on the blockchain network has an identical
    copy of the blockchain shown in Figure [1-4](#Fig4), where every block is a collection
    of transactions, hence the name. As you can see, there are two major parts in
    every block. The “header” part links back to the previous block in the chain.
    What it means is that every block header contains the hash of the previous block
    so that no one can alter any transaction in the previous block. We will look into
    further details of this concept in the following chapters. The other part of a
    block is the “body content” that has a validated list of transactions, their amounts,
    the addresses of the parties involved, and some more details. So, given the latest
    block, it is feasible to access all the previous blocks in a blockchain.Let us
    consider a practical example and see how the transactions take place and the ledger
    gets updated across the network, to see how this system works:Assume that there
    are three candidates—Alice, Bob, and Charlie—who are doing some monetary transactions
    among each other on a blockchain network. Let us go through the transactions step
    by step to understand blockchain’s open and decentralized features.Step-1:Let
    us assume that Alice had $50 with her, which is the genesis of all transactions
    and every node is aware of it, as shown in Figure [1-5](#Fig5).![A440588_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-5The genesis blockStep-2:Alice makes a transaction by paying $20 to Bob. Observe
    how the blockchain gets updated at each node, as shown in Figure [1-6](#Fig6).![A440588_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-6The first transactionStep-3:Bob makes another transaction by paying $10 to
    Charlie and the blockchain gets updated as shown in Figure [1-7](#Fig7).![A440588_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-7The second transactionPlease note that the transaction data in the blocks is
    immutable. All transactions are fully irreversible. Any change would result in
    a new transaction, which would get validated by all contributing nodes. Every
    node has its own copy of blockchain.If there are many questions popping up in
    your mind, such as “What if Alice pays the same amount to Dave to double-spend
    the same amount, or what if she is making a payment without having enough funds
    in her account?,” “How is the security ensured?,” and so on, that is wonderful!
    We are going to cover those details in the following chapters.

    given最新的区块，可以访问区块链中的所有前一个区块。让我们考虑一个实际例子，看看交易是如何在网络上进行，账本是如何在网络上更新的，以了解这个系统是如何工作的：假设有三名候选人——Alice、Bob和Charlie——他们在区块链网络上互相进行一些货币交易。让我们一步一步地经历这些交易，以了解区块链的开放和分布式特性。步骤1：假设Alice有50美元，这是所有交易的发源地，每个节点都意识到了这一点，如图[1-5](#Fig5)所示。![A440588_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.jpg)图1-5创世区块步骤2：Alice通过支付20美元给Bob进行一笔交易。观察区块链在每个节点上是如何更新的，如图[1-6](#Fig6)所示。![A440588_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.jpg)图1-6第一笔交易步骤3：Bob通过支付10美元给Charlie进行另一笔交易，区块链如图[1-7](#Fig7)所示更新。![A440588_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.jpg)图1-7第二笔交易请注意，区块中的交易数据是不可变的。所有交易都是完全不可逆的。任何更改都会导致新的交易，该交易会由所有贡献节点进行验证。每个节点都有自己的区块链副本。如果您脑海中涌现出许多问题，例如“如果Alice向Dave支付相同金额以双重花费相同金额，或者如果她账户中没有足够的资金进行支付会怎样？”，“安全性是如何得到保证的？”等等，那太好了！我们将在接下来的章节中覆盖这些细节。

- en: 'The very reason we are looking into the debate on centralization vs. decentralization
    is because blockchain is designed to be decentralized, defying the centralized
    design. However, the terns decentralized and centralized are not always clear.
    They are very poorly defined and misleading in many places. The reason is that
    there is almost no system that is purely centralized or decentralized. Most of
    the concepts and examples in this section are inspired from the notes of Mr. Vitalik
    Buterin, the founder of Ethereum blockchain.What is a distributed system then?
    Just so it does not mess with the current discussion, let us understand it first
    and take it off the list. Please note that whether a system is centralized or
    decentralized, it can still be distributed. A centralized distributed system is
    one in which there is, say, a master node responsible for breaking down the tasks
    or data and distribute the load across nodes. On the other hand, a decentralized
    distributed system is one where there is no “master” node as such and yet the
    computation may be distributed. Blockchain is one such example, and we will look
    at many diagrammatic representations of it later in this book. Figure [1-8](#Fig8)
    is a pictorial representation of how a centralized distributed system may look.![A440588_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-8A distributed system with centralized controlThis representation is similar
    to Hadoop implementation, as an example. Though the computation is faster in such
    designs because of distributed computing, it also suffers from limitations due
    to centralization  .Let us resume our discussion on centralization vs. decentralization.
    It is extremely important to note that for a system to be centralized/decentralized
    is not just limited to the technical architecture. What we intend to say is that
    a system can be centralized or decentralized technically, but may not be so logically
    or politically. Let us take a look at these different perspectives to be able
    to design a system correctly based on the requirement:Technical Architecture:
    A system can be centralized or decentralized from a technical architecture point
    of view. What we consider is how many physical computers (or nodes) are used to
    design a system, how many node failures it can sustain before the whole system
    goes down, etc.Political perspective: This perspective indicates the control  that
    an individual, or a group of people, or an organization as a whole has on a system.
    If the computers of the system are controlled by them, then the system is naturally
    centralized. However, if no specific individual or groups control the system and
    everyone has equal rights on the system, then it is a decentralized system in
    a political sense!Logical perspective: A system can be logically centralized or
    decentralized based on how it appears to be, irrespective of whether it is centralized
    or decentralized technically or politically. An alternative analogy could be that
    if you vertically cut a system (say of computing devices) in half with every half
    having service providers and consumers, if they can operate as independent units
    they are decentralized and centralized otherwise.All the aforementioned perspectives
    are crucial in designing a real-life system and calling it centralized or decentralized.
    Let us discuss some of the examples mixing these perspectives to clear up any
    confusion you might have:'

  zh: 我们研究集中化与去中心化之争的原因，正是因为区块链被设计为去中心化，挑战了传统的集中化设计。然而，“去中心化”与“集中化”这两个词并不总是清晰明了。它们定义模糊，在很多地方具有误导性。原因在于，几乎没有任何系统是完全集中化或去中心化的。本书大部分概念和示例灵感来源于以太坊区块链创始人维塔利克·布特林的笔记。那么分布式系统是什么呢？为了不干扰当前的讨论，让我们先来理解它，然后将其排除在外。请注意，无论一个系统是集中化还是去中心化，它仍然可以是分布式的。一个集中化分布式系统是指有一个主节点，负责分解任务或数据并将负载分配给其他节点。另一方面，一个去中心化分布式系统是指没有这样的“主”节点，但计算可能是分布式的。区块链就是这样一个例子，我们将在本书后面查看许多它的图解表示。图[1-8](#Fig8)是集中化分布式系统的一个图文表示。![A440588_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.jpg)1-8具有集中控制的分布式系统这种表示与Hadoop实现类似，作为例子。虽然由于分布式计算，这种设计中的计算速度更快，但中央集权也带来了局限性。让我们继续讨论集中化与去中心化之争。需要特别强调的是，一个系统是集中化/去中心化的，并不仅仅局限于技术架构。我们想表达的是，一个系统在技术上可以是集中化或去中心化的，但在逻辑上或政治上可能并非如此。让我们来看看这些不同的视角，以便根据要求正确设计系统：技术架构：从技术架构的角度来看，一个系统可以是集中化或去中心化的。我们考虑的是设计一个系统需要使用多少台物理计算机（或节点），它可以在节点失败多少次之前维持整个系统的运行，等等。政治视角：这个视角指的是个人、一群人或者整个组织对一个系统的控制程度。如果一个系统的计算机受到他们的控制，那么这个系统自然而然就是集中化的。然而，如果没有任何特定的个人或群体控制系统，并且每个人在系统上都有平等的权利，那么从政治意义上讲，这是一个去中心化系统！逻辑视角：一个系统可以根据它呈现的方式在逻辑上集中化或去中心化，而不管它在技术上或政治上是否集中化或去中心化。一个可能的类比是，如果你垂直将一个系统（比如计算设备）切成两半，每一半都有服务提供商和消费者，如果它们可以作为独立单元运作，那么它们就是去中心化的；否则就是集中化的。所有上述视角在设计现实生活中的系统时都至关重要，并将其称为集中化或去中心化。让我们讨论一些混合这些视角的例子，以澄清你可能存在的任何混淆：

- en: As of this writing, the public blockchain variants such as Ethereum are in the
    process of maturing, and building complex applications on top of these blockchains
    may not be a good idea. Keep in mind that blockchain is never just a piece of
    technology, but a combination of business principles, economics, game theory,
    cryptography, and computer science engineering. Most of the real-world applications
    are quite complex in nature, and it is advisable to build blockchain solutions
    from the ground up.The purpose of this section is only to provide you with a bird’s
    eye view of various blockchain layers, and delve deeper into the core fundamentals
    in the following chapters. To start with, let us just recollect our basic understanding
    of the TCP/IP protocol stack. The layered approach in the TCP/IP stack is actually
    a standard to achieve an open system. Having abstraction layers not only helps
    in understanding the stack better, but also helps in building products that are
    compliant to the stack to achieve an open system. Also, having the layers abstract
    from each other makes the system more robust and easy to maintain. Any change
    to any of the layers doesn’t impact the other layers. Again, the TCP/IP analogy
    is not to be confused with the blockchain layers. TCP/IP is a communication protocol
    that every Internet application uses, and so is blockchain.Enter the blockchain.
    There are no agreed global standards yet that would clearly segregate the blockchain
    components into distinct layers. A layered heterogeneous architecture is needed,
    but for now that is still in the future. So, we will try to formulate blockchain
    layers to be able to understand the technology better and build a comparative
    analogy between hundreds of blockchain/Cryptocurrency variants out there in the
    market. Take a look at the high-level, layered representation of blockchain in
    Figure [1-12](#Fig12).![A440588_1_En_1_Fig12_HTML.jpg](Images/A440588_1_En_1_Fig12_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-12Various layers of blockchainYou may be wondering why five layers and why not
    more granular layers, or fewer layers. Obviously, there cannot be too many or
    too few layers; it is going to be a trade-off driven among complexity, robustness,
    adaptability, etc., to name a few. The purpose again is not really to standardize
    blockchain technology, but to build a better understanding. Please keep in mind
    that all these layers are present on all the nodes.In Chapter [6](A440588_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml)
    of this book, we will be building a decentralized application from scratch and
    learning how blockchain functions on all these layers with a practical use case.

    transparency among participants, resilience against adversarial attacks etc.,
    there are multiple applications being built. Certain applications are just built
    in the application layer, taking for granted any available “flavor” of blockchain,
    and some applications are built in the application layer and are interwoven with
    other layers in blockchain. This is the reason the application layer should be
    considered a part of blockchain.This is the layer where you code up the desired
    functionalities and make an application out of it for the end users. It usually
    involves a traditional tech stack for software development such as client-side
    programming  constructs, scripting, APIs, development frameworks, etc. For the
    applications that treat blockchain as a backend, those applications might need
    to be hosted on some web servers and that might require web application development,
    server-side programming, and APIs, etc. Ideally, good blockchain applications
    do not have a client–server model, and there are no centralized servers that the
    clients access, which is just the way Bitcoin works.You probably have heard or
    already learned about the off-chain networks. The idea is to build applications
    that wouldn’t use blockchain for anything and everything, but use it wisely. In
    other words, this concept is to ensure that the heavy lifting is done at the application
    layer, or bulky storage requirements are taken care of off the chain so that the
    core blockchain  is light and effective and the network traffic is not too much.

    functionality并将其转化为最终用户应用程序的地方。它通常涉及软件开发的传统技术堆栈，如客户端编程构造、脚本、API、开发框架等。对于将区块链视为后端的应用程序，这些应用程序可能需要在一些web服务器上托管，这可能需要web应用程序开发、服务器端编程和API等。理想情况下，良好的区块链应用程序不应具有客户端-服务器模型，且客户端不应访问任何中心化服务器，这正是比特币的工作方式。您可能已经听说过或已经学习了关于离链网络的概念。这个想法是构建不会为任何事物都使用区块链的应用程序，而是明智地使用它。换句话说，这个概念是为了确保在应用程序层完成繁重的工作，或者在链外处理繁重的存储需求，以便核心区块链轻量且有效，且网络流量不过大。

    Layer take place on all the nodes in a blockchain network. The instructions could
    be simple instructions or a set of multiple instructions in the form of a smart
    contract . In either case, a program or a script needs to be executed to ensure
    the correct execution of the transaction. All the nodes in a blockchain network
    have to execute the programs/scripts independently. Deterministic execution of
    programs/scripts on the same set of inputs and conditions always produces the
    same output on all the nodes, which helps avoid inconsistencies.In the case of
    Bitcoins, these are simple scripts that are not Turing-complete and allow only
    a few set of instructions. Ethereum and Hyperledger, on the other hand, allow
    complex executions. Ethereum’s code or its smart contracts written in solidity
    gets compiled to Bytecode or Machine Code that gets executed on its own Ethereum
    Virtual Machine. Hyperledger has a much simpler approach for its chaincode smart
    contracts. It supports running of compiled machine codes inside docker images,
    and supports multiple high-level lanuages such as Java and Go.

  zh: 语义层
- en: The Semantic Layer is a logical layer because there is an orderliness in the
    transactions and blocks. A transaction, whether valid or invalid, has a set of
    instructions that gets through the Execution Layer but gets validated in the Semantic
    Layer. If it is Bitcoin, then whether one is spending a legitimate transaction,
    whether it is a double-spend attack, whether one is authorized to make this transaction,
    etc., are validated in this layer. You will learn in the following chapters that
    Bitcoins are actually present as transactions that represent the system state.
    To be able to spend a Bitcoin, you have to consume one or more previous transactions
    and there is no notion of Accounts. This means that when someone makes a transaction,
    they use one of the previous transactions where they had received at least the
    amount they are spending now. This transaction must be validated by all the nodes
    by traversing previous transactions to see if it is a legitimate transaction.
    Ethereum, on the other hand, has the system of Accounts. This means that the account
    of the one making the transaction and that of the one receiving it both get updated.In
    this layer, the rules of the system can be defined, such as data models and structures.
    There could be situations that are a little more complex compared with simple
    transactions. Complex instruction sets are often coded into smart contracts. The
    system’s state gets updated when a smart contract is invoked upon receiving a
    transaction. A smart contract is a special type of account that has executable
    code and private states. A block usually contains a bunch of transactions and
    some smart contracts. The data structures such as the Merkle tree are defined
    in this layer with the Merkle root  in the block header to maintain a relation
    between the block headers and the set of transactions in a block (usually Key-Value
    storage on disk). Also, the data models, storage modes, in-memory/disk based processing,
    etc. can be defined in this logical layer.Apart from the aforementioned, it is
    the semantic layer that defines how the blocks are linked with each other. Every
    block in a blockchain contains the hash of the previous block, all the way to
    the genesis block. Though the final state of the blockchain is achieved by the
    contributions from all the layers, the linking of blocks with each other needs
    to be defined in this layer. Depending on the use case, you might want to code
    up an additional functionality in this layer.

    with other nodes in the system. The Propagation Layer is the peer-to-peer communication
    layer that allows the nodes to discover each other, and talk and sync with each
    other with respect to the current state of the network. When a transaction is
    made, we know that it gets broadcast to the entire network. Similarly, when a
    node wants to propose a valid block, it gets immediately propagated to the entire
    network so that other nodes could build on it, considering it as the latest block.
    So, transaction/block propagation in the network is defined in this layer, which
    ensures stability of the whole network. By design, most of the blockchains are
    designed such that they forward a transaction/block immediately to all the nodes
    they are directly connected to, when they get to know of a new transaction/block.In
    the asynchronous Internet network  , there are often latency issues for transaction
    or block propagation. Some propagations occur within seconds and some take more
    time, depending on the capacity of the nodes, network bandwidth, and a few more

    the nodes, depending on the use case. Safety and security of the blockchain is
    accertained in this layer. In Bitcoin or Ethereum, the consensus is achieved through
    proper incentive techniques called “mining.” For a public blockchain to be self-sustainable,
    there has to be some sort of incentivization mechanisms that not only helps in
    keeping the network alive, but also enforces consensus  . Bitcoin and Ethereum
    use a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to randomly select a node that can
    propose a block. Once that block is proposed and propagated to all the nodes,
    they check to see if it a valid block with all legitimate transactions and that
    the PoW puzzle was solved properly; they add this block to their own copy of blockchain
    and build further on it. There are many different variants of consensus protocols
    such as Proof of Stake (PoS), deligated PoS (dPoS), Practical Byzantine Fault

- en: Blockchain came along with Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency, in 2009 via a
    simple mailing list. Soon after it was launched, people could realize its true
    potential beyond just cryptocurrency. Some companies came up with different flavors
    of blockchain offerings such as Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc. Microsoft and IBM
    came up with SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings on their Azure and Bluemix
    cloud platforms, respectively. Different start-ups were formed, and many established
    companies took blockchain initiatives that focused on solving some business problems
    that were not easily solved before.It is too late now to just say that blockchain
    has tremendous potential to disrupt almost every industry in some way or the other;
    the revolution has already started. It has hugely impacted the financial services
    market. It is difficult to name a global bank or finance entity not exploring
    blockchain. Apart from the financial market, initiatives have already been/are
    already being taken in areas such as media and entertainment, energy trading,
    prediction markets, retail chains, loyalty rewards systems, insurance, logistics
    and supply chains, medical records, and also government and military applications.As
    of this writing, the current situation is such that many start-ups and companies
    are able to see how a blockchain-based system can really address some pain areas
    and become beneficial in many ways. However, designing the right kind of blockchain
    solution is quite challenging. There are some really great ideas for a blockchain-based
    product or solution, but it is equally difficult to either build them or implement
    them. There are some use cases that can only be built on a public blockchain.
    Designing a self-sustainable blockchain with a proper mining ecosystem is difficult,
    and when it comes to the existing public blockchains to build non-cryptocurrency
    applications there is none other than Ethereum. Whether a blockchain application
    is to be built in the Application Layer only and use the underlying layers as
    they are, or the application needs to be built from the ground up, is something
    difficult to decide. There are some technical challenges, too. Blockchain is still
    maturing, and it may take few more years for mainstream adoption. As of today,
    there are multiple propositions to address the scalability issues of blockchain.
    We will try to build a solid understanding on all these perspectives in this entire
    book. For now, let us see some of the specific uses and use cases in the following
    section.

  zh: 区块链与比特币一同出现，这是一种数字加密货币，是通过一个简单的邮件列表在2009年出现的。它推出后不久，人们就意识到它的真正潜力远远超出了加密货币。一些公司提出了不同风味的区块链产品，如以太坊、超级账本等。微软和IBM分别在他们的Azure和Bluemix云平台上推出了SaaS（软件即服务）产品。不同的初创公司纷纷成立，许多成熟的公司也开始采取区块链行动，专注于解决一些以前难以解决的商业问题。现在仅仅说区块链具有巨大潜力，几乎可以在每个行业以某种方式引发变革，已经太晚了；革命已经开始。它对金融服务市场产生了巨大影响。很难说出哪家全球银行或金融机构没有在探索区块链。除了金融服务市场，媒体和娱乐、能源交易、预测市场、零售连锁、忠诚度奖励系统、保险、物流和供应链、医疗记录，以及政府和企业应用等领域已经/正在采取行动。截至当前写作，当前的情况是许多初创公司和公司能够看到基于区块链的系统如何真正解决一些痛点，并在许多方面产生益处。然而，设计正确的区块链解决方案是非常具有挑战性的。对于基于区块链的产品或解决方案有一些非常好的想法，但建造它们或实施它们同样困难。有些用例只能建立在公共区块链上。设计一个自给自足的区块链并拥有适当的挖矿生态系统是困难的，而且当涉及到在现有公共区块链上构建非加密货币应用时，除了以太坊外别无选择。无论区块链应用是否只在应用层构建并使用底层作为它们是，或者应用需要从零开始建造，这都是难以决定的事情。也有一些技术挑战。区块链仍然在成熟，可能还需要几年时间才能被主流采用。截至目前，已经有多个提议来解决区块链的可扩展性问题。我们将尝试在这整本书中建立对这些所有方面的深入了解。现在，让我们看看以下章节中的某些具体应用和用例。

    taken across industries such as finance, insurance, banking, healthcare, government,
    supply chains, IoT (Internet of Things), and media and entertainment to name a
    few. The possibilities are limitless, however! A true sharing economy, which was
    difficult to achieve in centralized systems, is possible using blockchain technology
    (e.g., peer-to-peer versions of Uber, AirBNB). It is also possible to enable citizens
    to own their identity (Self-Sovereign Digital Identity) and monetize their own
    data using this technology. For now, let us take a look at some of the existing
    use cases.

  zh: 在本节中，我们将查看一些已经在各行各业中采取的举措，如金融、保险、银行、医疗保健、政府、供应链、物联网（IoT）和媒体娱乐等。可能性是无限的！在一个中心化系统中难以实现的真正共享经济，使用区块链技术是可能的（例如，Uber、AirBNB的去中心化版本）。利用这项技术，公民可以拥有自己的身份（自我主权数字身份）并货币化自己的数据。现在，让我们来看一些现有的用例。
- en: Any type of property or asset, whether physical or digital, such as laptops,
    mobile phones, diamonds, automobiles, real estate, e-registrations, digital files,
    etc. can be registered on blockchain. This can enable these asset transactions
    from one person to another, maintain the transaction log, and check validity or
    ownerships. Also, notary services, proof of existence, tailored insurance schemes,
    and many more such use cases can be developed.

- en: There are many financial use cases being developed on blockchain such as cross-border
    payments, share trading, loyalty and rewards system, Know Your Customer (KYC)
    among banks, etc. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is one of the most trending use
    cases as of this writing. ICO is the best way of crowdsourcing today by using
    cryptocurrency as digital assets. A coin in an ICO can be thought of as a digital
    stock in an enterprise, which is very easy to buy and trade.

    music streaming services facilitated higher market penetration, but made the royalty
    determination more complex. This concern can pretty much be addressed by blockchain
    by maintaining a public ledger of music rights ownership information as well as
    authorised distribution of media content.

- en: 'This is the IoT era, with billions of IoT devices everywhere and many more
    to join the pool. A whole bunch of different makes, models, and communication
    protocols makes it difficult to have a centralized system to control the devices
    and provide a common data exchange platform. This is also an area where blockchain
    can be used to build a decentralized peer-to-peer system for the IoT devices to
    communicate with each other. ADEPT (Autonomous Decentralized Peer-To-Peer Telemetry)
    is a joint initiative from IBM and Samsung that has developed a platform that
    uses elements of the Bitcoin’s underlying design to build a distributed network
    of devices—a decentralized IOT. ADEPT uses three protocols: BitTorrent for file
    sharing, Ethereum for smart contracts, and TeleHash for peer-to-peer messaging
    in the platform. The IOTA foundation is another such initiative.'

    use cases where technical decentralization is necessary, but politically should
    be governed by governments: land registration, vehicle registration and management,
    e-Voting, etc. are some of the active use cases. Supply chains are another area
    where there are some great use cases of blockchain. Supply chains have always
    been prone to disputes across the globe, as it was always difficult to maintain
    transparency in these systems.'

  zh: 总结
- en: 'In this chapter, we covered the evolution of blockchain, the history of it,
    what it is, the design benefits, and why it is so important with some relevant
    use cases. In this section, we will conclude with its game-changing offerings,
    in line with the technology revolution.In the 1990s, mass adoption of the Internet
    changed the way people did business. It removed friction from creation and distribution
    of information. This paved the way for new markets, more opportunities, and possibilities.
    Similarly, blockchain is here today to take the Internet to a whole new level
    by removing friction along three key areas: Control, Trust, and Value.Control:
    Blockchain enabled distribution of the control by making the system decentralized.Trust:
    Blockchain is an immutable, tamper-resistant ledger. It gives a single, shared
    source of truth to all nodes, making the system trustless. What it means is that
    trust is no longer needed to transact with any unknown person or entity and is
    inherent by design.Value: Blockchain enables exchange of value in any form. One
    can issue and transfer assets without central entities or intermediaries.In Chapter
    [2](A440588_1_En_2_Chapter_split_000.xhtml), we will take a deep dive into the
    blockchain fundamentals.'
