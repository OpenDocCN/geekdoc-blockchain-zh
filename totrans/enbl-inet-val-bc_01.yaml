- en: The internet was conceived as a technology to enable communication via computers
    in the case of a partial network disruption, as might occur during a military
    conflict. It soon turned out that packet switching networks, in which data are
    flexibly routed via intermediary nodes, have numerous advantages over circuit
    switching, in which a dedicated communication channel is established prior to
    the start of a communication. The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
    (TCP/IP) emerged as a protocol suite that includes four distinct layers, namely
    link (sometimes split into physical and data link layers), network, transport
    and application. Those layers implement the functionality which is specified in
    the 7-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and form the basis of the
    modern Internet.

- en: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is part of the application layer and
    provides the foundation for the World Wide Web (WWW). Over the years, it has been
    proven to be a robust protocol capable of handling data requests. One of its significant
    shortcomings, however, is the fact that it is stateless. This refers to the fact
    that HTTP servers by default do not keep session information; each message sent
    is understood in isolation. A stateful protocol, in comparison, sees a single
    data packet as part of an overall communication. Simply put, such a protocol can
    answer questions such as “who is who?”, “who owns what?” and “who has the right
    to do what?” (Voshmgir [2019](#CR10)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Interestingly, the specification of HTTP includes a status code (402: “Payment
    required”) which is reserved for future use and indicates that the necessity of
    monetary transfers was recognised early by the protocol’s developers. However,
    for many years no technology existed to implement such a functionality.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It did not take long before the potential of the Internet for doing business
    was discovered. With the emergence of electronic commerce, the shortcomings of
    a stateless protocol soon became even more apparent. Sessions (“server-side cookies”)
    and cookies were used to keep track of ongoing and previous communications. In
    the case of sessions, data are stored on the server in an encrypted form and enable
    secure communication. Cookies on the client side are stored by the web browser
    which sends them back to the server, creating a memory of previous events. Sessions
    and cookies enabled the WWW to become “stateful”. This offered new opportunities
    for businesses and customers but also led to the emergence of powerful intermediaries
    which monitor and direct communication, transactions and gather vast amounts of
    data. The WWW has also turned into a platform for social exchange. A handful of
    dominating platforms have emerged due to network effects, which postulate that
    the value of a network increases with the number of its users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consequently, Internet users turned from consumers into producers of information
    through posting content online and simply surfing the WWW, leaving numerous traces
    of online behaviour behind. In addition, sessions and cookies made it possible
    to transfer payments through dedicated organisations, which not only monitor and
    potentially also control transactions but also charge fees for their services.
    This led to a situation in which a few powerful intermediaries emerged that are
    in charge of value transfer over the Internet. These organisations include credit
    card companies, which successfully transferred their business models from the
    real world into cyberspace, and new market entrants who tailored their business
    models to the Internet’s capabilities. However, the full potential of the Internet
    did not materialise. In spite of the fact that modern networks allow for almost
    instant data transmission, in 2017 a typical international payment in the United
    States took 3-5 days to settle, had an error rate of over 5% and an average cost
    of USD 42\. On a global basis, cross-border payments amounted to USD 180 trillion
    yearly, with a combined cost of more than USD 1.7 trillion (Ripple [2017](#CR6)).

    by the pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto, cleverly combined numerous existing
    technologies and, for the first time, solved the problem of online “double spending”.
    Bitcoin is a decentralised network that achieves consensus without a pre-specified
    governance structure (see Chapter “Consensus: Proof of Work, Proof of Stake and
    Structural Alternatives”). In other words, one specific Bitcoin (or an arbitrary
    part thereof) can be owned by only one particular address at any specific point
    in time. Being a decentralised platform does not mean that Bitcoin lacks any form
    of governance, but rather that it does not depend on particular authorities in
    a rigid hierarchy. Instead, a consensus is reached between stakeholders such as
    developers, miners (mining pools) and validating nodes, all of whom can individually
    decide to enter or leave the system.'

    The value of a bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand of its users and
    is not backed by any other asset. The maintenance of the system is done by miners,
    who are incentivised by gaining cryptocurrency for the provision of computing
    power. Unlike existing payment systems, no central authority exists that determines
    costs, monitors transactions or restricts access.

    use cases beyond cryptocurrencies and for the technology to gain widespread popularity.
    Numerous so-called Altcoins have emerged, modifying the source code of Bitcoin
    and adding additional functionality. Everything that can be mapped onto a digital
    asset can be transferred via a blockchain-based solution. On top of the Bitcoin
    blockchain, so-called coloured coins were used to represent real-world assets,
    but the limitations of Bitcoin’s scripting language soon triggered the quest for
    more robust solutions. Consequently, blockchain platforms such as Ethereum were
    developed with the goal of increased flexibility through the availability of a
    fully-fledged programming language. Increasing amounts of functionalities were
    integrated into so-called tokens that can be easily transferred on the network
    and represent an asset. The term “tokenisation” thus refers to the transformation
    of asset rights into digital tokens that can be easily traded on secondary markets.
    In the offline world, this corresponds to the well-established financial practice
    of securitisation, by which different types of contractual debt or illiquid assets,
    such as mortgage or auto loans, are bundled and sold to third-party investors.

- en: The meaning of the term “value” has been fiercely debated among philosophers
    since the days of the ancient Greeks. A common distinction is made between intrinsic
    and extrinsic value, with the former, especially in a business context, often
    seen as the value that can be determined through fundamental analysis without
    referring to the actual market value. This distinction on value is not crucial
    for moving towards a definition of the IoV; rather the crucial point is that blockchain
    is capable of creating digital twins, which are digital representations of objects
    from the physical world, including human beings but mostly intangibles such as
    processes or systems. These digital twins can be expressed in monetary terms such
    that a certain value is assigned to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain technology facilitates the transfer of these digital representations
    with the help of asymmetric cryptography. By generating a pair of keys, one of
    which is public and the other one private, users can create certificates to prove
    the ownership of a digital asset. They can easily transfer them to other addresses
    instantaneously. The moment the transaction is validated by the network and written
    into the blockchain, control over the asset has shifted to the new owner. This
    validation process was previously done by third-party institutions such as banks.
    Here, banks are an intermediary facilitating the transfer of value. Other examples
    for intermediaries include brokers, agents or merchants. It is therefore likely
    that the role of existing intermediaries will change and new intermediaries will
    emerge, who will take over tasks such as identity verification or the quality
    assurance of physical property.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with the more widespread use of the technology, intermediaries are not needed

    is used as a medium for data exchange for objects in the physical world. Smart
    objects are computing devices equipped with positioning and communication technologies
    that communicate with each other over the Internet without the need for any human
    interference. The Internet of Things, therefore, refers to the communication of
    objects, whereas the IoV focuses on the addition of blockchain technology to create
    a layer for value transfer. The latter can be seen as an enabler for the former
    by enabling the interoperability and exchange of monetary assets without human
    interaction. The IoV can also enable micropayments, namely the transfer of small
    amounts of money that are only feasible in systems with low transaction costs.

    Payments Interest Group ([2015](#CR11)). In their manifesto, they first state
    that many value networks exist and always will do so, and that there are many
    ways to connect them. Furthermore, they identify several key attributes of the
    IoV such as the free movement of information, openness and availability for everyone,
    the existence of trust and security, the simultaneous occurrence of privacy and
    transparency, the absence of a single point of control, the application of open
    standards, and a simple and extensible underlying infrastructure.

    OpenStand, a movement to embrace principles for a modern paradigm of standards.
    These standards are respectful cooperation between standards organisations, adherence
    to the fundamental parameters of standards development, the collective empowerment
    to strive to develop standards that are chosen and defined based on technical
    merit, the availability of standards specifications and, finally, voluntary adoption
    by the standards market (IEEE Standards [2014](#CR5)).Table 2

    Thirdly, on the ecosystem level networks and advocacy groups need to conduct research
    and spread knowledge. Table [2](#Tab2) briefly summarises and explains these attributes.

- en: In addition to the attributes in Tables [2](#Tab2), [3](#Tab3) identifies several
    enablers of an IoV. The digitalisation of value, namely the estimation of an asset’s
    market valuation, is a prerequisite to creating an economy in which assets can
    be represented by their digital counterparts such as tokens. In addition, fundamental
    changes are required within organisations, which pertains both to business processes
    as well as organisational structures. Existing management tasks, many of which
    are auditing and control functions, will potentially be replaced by automated
    procedures controlled by algorithms. Decentralised applications and decentralised
    autonomous organisations (DAOs) allow for an unmediated exchange between objects,
    people and machines. The latter is enabled by machine-to-machine (M2M) technology
    or communication. The IoV thus provides the payment layer for all ongoing initiatives
    in this area.Table 3

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The addition of a stateful layer on top of the existing Internet protocol that
    enables the transfer of assets has significant economic repercussions pertaining
    to both governance issues as well as the overall structure of networks. The removal
    of intermediaries, in combination with increased information transparency, leads
    to a mitigation of the principal-agent problem. This pertains to situations where
    agents, who possess all relevant information, act in their own best interests
    rather than for those of the principals. The IoV helps to reduce this specific
    problem by applying smart contracts as well as by giving principals advanced options
    to monitor transactions. Similarly, increased transaction speed, as well as automation,
    will help to decrease transaction costs, namely all expenses related to making
    economic trades such as costs for search and information, negotiation, control
    and adjustment. From an organisational perspective, the IoV can help to create
    new forms of competitive advantage. Nevertheless, it might also disrupt existing
    organisational structures by automating complicated processes that previously
    demanded verification and confirmation at different hierarchical levels (Treiblmaier
    [2018](#CR8)).

    further evolution is straightforward and easy to predict. Many unresolved issues
    remain, which include topics such as privacy, especially when sensitive personal
    data are involved. When it comes to security, Blockchain/DLT technology has specific
    advantages over centralised database technologies as it does not offer a central
    point of attack. However, this does not mean that attack vectors on different
    levels do not exist. Targets for attack could be users’ wallets but also the network,
    mining pools or smart contracts. In addition, the technology is still under development
    and predictions are hard to make regarding the technology itself and also where
    potential attack strategies are heading to.

    those who mainly function as intermediaries in the value chain, will react to
    changes in market structures and the emergence of novel business models which
    capitalise on the easy transfer of value.

    pace. In 2020, every person generated 1.7 MB in just a second, and Internet users
    as a whole generated about 2.5 EB of data each day (Po et al. [2020](#CR10), 4–6).
    Regardless of whether we are aware of it or not, each of us every single day leaves
    our fingerprints in cyberspace. Every simple thing we do (from downloading a report,
    to ordering a pizza online, or to access the gym with our PIN) is potentially
    captured by someone and stored in servers somewhere in the cloud. This process
    of datafication is turning many aspects of our life into data, with value beyond
    their immediate utility. At one level, data that relate to our habits, routines,
    and other aspects of our lives have value in and of themselves by enabling consumers
    to interact with each other and the market in novel ways. According to World Economic
    Forum (WEF), we will produce more data in the next three years (2020–2022) than

    and it is estimated that by the end of 2020, the number of interconnected devices
    will exceed 50 billion; by 2022, 1 trillion networked sensors will be embedded

    of our lives into information as a new form of value. Through the process of datafication,
    information technology lets us measure, track, and exchange ever more types of
    value at ever-smaller increments. It is essential, therefore, to build an interconnected

    a few decades ago of reduction in the material used in products. Dematerialisation
    is not only about digital goods but also physical goods. Physical goods have seen
    an increasing shift from tangible to intangible components. Soft things like intelligence
    are embedded in hard things, making physical goods increasingly behave more similarly
    to software.

    a production economy to an emerging service economy. As such, all spheres of the
    economy become redefined away from the conception of units of production—which
    underpinned our economic systems in past centuries—towards the more fluid concept
    of the exchange of value enabled by the IoV. A service economy is about value
    delivered. A service is an exchange of value—you do not get the product; you just
    get its function and the value that it delivers. As such, during this transition
    phase, the principle of “ownership of”—around which we built the capitalism markets—is
    put aside in favour of the more adequate principle of “access to.” Indeed, ownership
    is casual, and a transaction occurs only once. Instead, a service economy is based
    on subscriptions to services characterised by an ongoing stream of data and transactions
    that are better supported if we get seamlessly ubiquitous access to the IoV.

    platforms supported by computer and network-based information and communications
    technologies (ICT), which match both demand and supply of underutilised assets
    and allow everybody to be connected and disseminate/exchange information and value.
    Here, I refer to the third generation of platform business models: multisided
    marketplaces where a multitude of buyers and sellers meet and exchange any type
    of digital or digitised goods and value. Examples include data exchange platforms
    such as Dawex (dawex.com) and digital security marketplace such as Securitize
    (securitize.io). However, platformisation goes beyond digital goods and also includes
    idle physical goods, the utility of which can be exchanged among peers. Think
    about the emerging car-sharing platforms like Streetcar, ShareNow, and Zipcar
    or the platforms that allow households to let out their underutilised space like
    Airbnb and HomeAway.'

    (platforms that depend on other platforms through mutually beneficial connections)
    that evolve in a Darwinian fashion by matching different needs and purposes. A
    growing component of our economy is occupied by platform business models that,
    for the amount of value generated, are gradually displacing linear business models.^([3](#Fn3))
    In this “platformisation,” consumers are closer to the producers, and in fact,
    consumers often act as producers or what the futurist Alvin Tafler called the
    “prosumers.” Millions of consumers become prosumers. They exchange value in lateral
    networks at near-zero marginal costs. The difference between the linear business
    models and the platform is that the linear business models scale up by investing
    in internal resources and inventories. Instead, platform business models do not
    directly create and control inventory. They scale up by investing in their networks.
    The larger their network, the greater their value.

    and environmental capital in exchange for higher private profits. We have eroded
    the overall value of social and public goods (think about environmental pollution,
    for example) in favour of the value of private and personal goods. It is now recognised
    that this capitalist model is broken and that it cannot continue with the same
    principles as in the past. A growing number of people and companies are not willing
    anymore to compromise social capital and natural resources for higher profits.
    This can be seen most clearly in the demand for assets tied in measurable ways
    to the quality of life. There is a growing awareness of their value, and people
    place a higher demand for quality of life, which of course engenders a broader
    spectrum of values beyond economic utility. Over the past decades, we have increasingly
    begun the process of tracking and accounting for different forms of value whether
    these are green bonds, social impact bonds, company loyalty schemes, carbon accounting
    (Richardson and Xu [2020](#CR001)), or a multiplicity of other forms. The IoV
    becomes, therefore, the infrastructure that allows us to smoothly exchange this
    growing number of different types of social and environmental values between companies
    and people.

    driving factors. At its core, the IoV is the information network that facilitates
    the transfer of value (often and increasingly) without the involvement or intermediation
    of a third party. It is exponentially characterised by hyperconnectivity. Almost
    by design, dematerialisation and platformisation require economic actors in ever
    more significant numbers to exchange data and value across networks. As in all
    markets, trust between participants is essential, and we would, therefore, expect
    that the IoV will emerge as interconnected networks of trust. Distributed Ledger
    Technologies (DLT) are a novel way of providing this trust, and other trust-providing
    technologies will likely emerge as the IoV takes shape in the next few years.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certainly, the systemic risk increases with the number of interdependencies
    between numerous and diverse networks of trust, which characterise the current
    globalised economy (Battiston et al. [2012](#CR2)). This is particularly true
    for financial networks where banks not only hold overlapping portfolios but also
    hold claims on each other’s liabilities. In this setting, a bank’s payoff not
    only depends on the bank’s own financial condition but also on the financial conditions
    of the other banks to which it is interconnected. Thus, individual default risks
    are likely to be spread over the neighbours in the network (Tasca et al. [2017](#CR15)).
    For example, the UK interbank network was highly concentrated, exhibiting fat-tailed
    distributions of linkages and loan sizes at the time of the 2008–2009 global financial
    crisis (Saporta [2009](#CR12)). Consequently, the UK suffered a severe recession
    (Economic and Social Research Council [2015](#CR5)). Such network systems are
    characterised with tipping points, where shocks have a rippling effect, and a
    few failing nodes can cause the entire system to collapse (Gai and Kapadia [2019](#CR6)).

    in its infancy.^([4](#Fn4)) However, we can learn from other interconnected systems
    like the financial system, and we can derive some properties that can be used
    as a reference to measure the potential risks emerging in the IoV. History teaches
    us that increasing interconnection in complex financial systems is characterised
    by emergent properties that are not observable at the microlevel and higher fragility
    that can lead to cascading defaults and failures. Networks exhibit a trade-off
    between efficiency and robustness to attacks. The network topology, which is desirable
    for efficiency gains, does not generally match the one that is preferable in terms
    of robustness against attacks (Trajanovski et al. [2013](#CR17)).

    be considered a public good and if this public good would be managed by private
    entities that pursue private profits. In such a case, the IoV would be a private
    international network that would need—in case of disaster—to be backed by taxpayers
    because it would be too big to fail. Should we need to consider a public bailout
    of a privately managed system? These are the questions that we need to answer
    to properly design a stable, robust, and efficient IoV architecture. My recommendation
    is that the IoV architecture should wisely balance both the public and private
    interests.

    by design but also public models—that shall be decentralised—indeed tend to become
    centralised over time. For example, the top 5 mining ETH pools secure about 80%
    of the transactions in the ledger, 20% of ETH’s core code was written by a single
    coder, 30% of Bitcoin’s core code was written by a single coder, and 50% of all
    comments for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) come from the 0.3% of commenters.
    Given these dualities, we face a conundrum: either we let networks of trust be
    run by centralised but accountable trust providers or we keep direct “control”
    of our data via a synthetic-trust machine replication run by a small group of
    anonymous people who could easily go rogue (Tasca [2018](#CR14)).'

    the risk arising from the lack of interoperability between different networks

    interoperability constitutes the point at which tensions emerge between three
    distinct intentions for blockchain technology as regulatory technology, business/economic
    infrastructure, and the model of social organisation. If “code is law,” then the
    interoperability between blockchains is not a mere problem of standards; it is
    a problem of norms that should be addressed with reciprocal recognition between
    sovereign powers in their own space (Tasca and Piselli [2019](#CR16)).
