    ninety-year-old great-uncle understands famine’s words well. When I visit him
    one winter, he takes me on an indulgent trip to the food court near his house,
    at Tianjin’s Kerry Center. He has a small, tidy pension that he spends sparingly;
    he never goes out to eat. Yet he says my visit is special, so I know his affection
    will be communicated through food, from his own memory of hunger—an endless selection
    of dishes await us at the mall.

    wanted to continue the project and finish the building. But when they looked closely
    at the plans, they found that the size of each apartment was completely uninhabitable.
    Living rooms that were smaller than four square meters, windows that faced walls …

    corners of her mouth drooping with age. On weekends, the food court is crowded
    with young families from nearby residential buildings, but on weekdays this court
    is the dominion of the old. And in contemporary China, this is a common plague,
    the plague of being old and lonely. As younger generations leave villages, hometowns,

    you are stewarding for the government. If you do decide to migrate to the city,

    It was these enterprises that marked the “rural roots of Chinese capitalism,”
    writes Huang.^([2](notes-ch1.xhtml#notes-ch1-2)) According to Huang, rural residents
    from some of the poorest provinces were undertaking bold entrepreneurship that
    was impossible in cities. These entrepreneurial models, TVEs, were radically different
    from the government-controlled State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Instead, TVEs were
    a decisively indigenous innovation, centered around local, village-level decision-making—an
    *agile* environment of sorts. By 1995, “TVEs accounted for approximately a quarter
    of China’s GDP, two-thirds of the total rural output … and more than one-third
    of China’s export earnings.”^([3](notes-ch1.xhtml#notes-ch1-3)) And with this
    economic boom, free market socialism allowed for another kind of national consciousness
    to emerge. Rather than being at the whim of other countries’ political events,

    undertaking emphasizes how intertwined the rural and urban are, with technological
    change threaded throughout. What China faces now is a potential “agrarian transition,”
    a term used by economists and agricultural policy makers. Agrarian transition
    is the process in which farmers are pushed out of the countryside and small-scale
    farming is replaced by industrialized agriculture, which requires less manual
    labor. As a result, there is a surplus of labor as farmers attempt to re-skill
    or find new jobs.

    and the Industrial Revolution “could have never happened without the agrarian
    transition. The Industrial Revolution displaced people from the countryside and
    created a large reserve army of labor.”^([4](notes-ch1.xhtml#notes-ch1-4)) While
    the transition might sound easy or logical, the social, environmental, and political

    plants in stimulating economic growth. As the abolitionist and scholar Ruth Wilson
    Gilmore writes in her book *Golden Gulag: Prisons,* *Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition
    in Globalizing California*, prisons were purposefully constructed in rural California
    throughout the 1990s with an economic agenda. The rural prison industry was fueled
    by policy makers trying to alleviate the economic crisis, because even as crime
    rates declined across America, prison populations grew. Building rural prisons
    would capitalize on the surplus foreclosed land that came from the Farm Crisis,
    and transfer vulnerable urban communities of color into rural prisons just as
    the social services of education, health care, and public assistance were being
    eroded. A 2017 study by the Vera Institute of Justice highlighted how the rural
    incarceration trend continues to grow. According to the study, financial incentives

    scrying mirror, a device used for divination, a mirror on which to project all
    our desires. The future, in perpetuity. One of the gifts of the free market has
    been precisely that: the delusion that we are free of the past, expanding ever
    outward into a startling, wild future abetted by the free market, liberalism,
    and technology. The end of history, as Francis Fukuyama would call it. I have
    traded a family story, subject to the forces of political will, for a life that
    changes and moves under economic forces, through the will of financial capital,
    of Alibaba and Amazon. And it remains to be seen just how the inhabitants of the
    new socialist countryside will embrace this same free market futurity.'

    the internet, of technology, the future of China’s place in the world, but simply
    the place where I am now: Tianjin, a city that was always subject to global forces,
    simple geographies, degrees separated from its past. I see Tianjin’s port, the
    Haihe River winding through the city to the ocean, and how the skyscrapers gleam
    against the glassy waves of the Bohai Sea. Tianjin, as it is, a place that does
    not have to be read in relation to someone else’s history. No single vision of
    an imagined nation, no single person staking a claim to dictate everyone’s future,
    either on this side of the Pacific or the other. I see so clearly the constant
    mental images nations have or make of each other. A world politics based on mirrors.
    What is China but a projection of American fears and desires? And for China, what
    is the United States but a projection of desires and fears? Nationalist dreams
    stand, dull and mute, nothing more than a point between dream and illusion. There
    is nothing to be gained by dreaming, and everything to be gained by seeing.'

- en: How would moving beyond machine-human boundaries and Western models of mind-body
    dualism bring new life to AI research? This recipe speculates on just that—when
    a group of AI researchers use traditional Chinese medicine, a five-thousand-year-old
    system of medical practices and philosophy, to advance technology. It is not new
    for proposals for eating and nutrition to be foundational to philosophy, from
    the core tenets of Taoism and Buddhism to works on macrobiotic diets by George
    Ohsawa and Aveline Kushi. Seeing the body as a holistic system, non-Western theories
    of the body allow for new ways of thinking through substance, matter, and being,
    which are core to the project of building sentient artificial intelligence. These
    non-Western theories have been marginalized throughout time by the forces of imperialism
    and colonialism.

- en: 'While companies in the West promised self-driving cars and fully sentient machines
    by 2020, neural networks used in AI are still constrained by a number of factors,
    including the specificity of training data for AI models, which is said to create
    a “generalization problem”: an inability to adapt to unseen new data. For example,
    AI models trained to perform facial recognition can classify well-lit images with
    great accuracy, but have a difficult time classifying faces if the photos are
    obscured, occluded, or shown in different lighting conditions than the images
    on which the AI model was trained. This barrier, along with increasing techno-pessimism,
    led to a decreased public interest in AI.'

- en: In the midst of winter 2022, when venture capital funding and public enthusiasm
    for AI dried up, a group of Chinese scientists and researchers at the Alibaba
    AI lab took up the task of generalizing AI models. Instead of Western philosophies
    of mind, they started from Chinese theories of the body, Chinese medicine, and
    Buddhist thought. In Western medicine, models of the body center around the brain,
    which controls other organs, the processes that regulate our body, consciousness,
    and emotion. In Chinese medicine, there are eleven vital organs that work holistically
    to sustain life, and this list does not include the brain. Brain functions are
    scattered throughout the body.

    and outputs from a combination of artificial and human organs. This hybrid machine
    was able to perform broader tasks without further training data; however, it was
    still not fully sentient. Scientists believe further development is needed to
    better understand what other parts of the body creative and language functions
    reside in. Yet the ability of the machine to extend its thinking was the first
    breakthrough in a long, icy AI winter.

    It’s quick and easy to make. You can use a pressure cooker, an Instant Pot, or
    a rice cooker with a porridge setting. Make sure the rice-to-soy-milk ratio is
    1:10\. After that, put in the other ingredients (dong quai, goji berries, ginger,
    red dates, dried apricots). Bring the mixture to a boil and then simmer for 1
    hour, or run the porridge setting on your Instant Pot.
