  prefs: []

- en: The first was the emerging “new world order.” The industry was moving from decentralized
    currencies like bitcoin to privately issued stablecoins by the likes of JP Morgan
    and Wells Fargo, and it became apparent that central banks (like the US Federal
    Reserve) would soon be introducing their own digital currencies. This would likely
    be followed by global digital currencies from international banking entities such
    as the World Bank and IMF. Private coins, national coins, and global coins, all
    powered by blockchain.
