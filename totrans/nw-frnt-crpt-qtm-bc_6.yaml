    comprehensive study of the three critical aspects of security: confidentiality,
    integrity, and authentication. As it is known, cryptography plays a vital and
    critical role in achieving the primary aims of security goals, such as authentication,
    integrity, confidentiality, and no-repudiation. Cryptographic algorithms are developed
    in order to achieve these goals as discussed during this book. Moreover, this
    book discusses the fundamentals of private and public key cryptography. Moreover,
    it explains the details of the main building blocks of these cryptographic systems.
    Besides, this chapter explores the different crypto-analysis techniques. It addresses
    stream ciphers, DES and 3DES, AES, block ciphers, the RSA cryptosystem, and public
    key cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem, ECC, key exchange algorithms,
    and so many other algorithms. Moreover, this chapter provides a comparison between
    different encryption algorithms in terms of speed encryption, decoding, complexity,
    the length of the key, structure, and flexibility. This book explores different
    cryptography concepts such as authentication, integrity, availability, access
    control, and non-repudiation. It presents concepts of digital signatures, hash
    functions, and MACs. Finally, this book discusses the cutting-edge cryptographic
    techniques such as quantum cryptography, DNA cryptography, chaotic cryptography,
    lightweight cryptography, and blockchain cryptography. All these cryptography
    techniques are promising and rapid emerging fields in data security.'
