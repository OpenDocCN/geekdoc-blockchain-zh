    that we’ll call the Blockchain Bazaar. In every stall are vendors selling tokens.
    Some tokens cost a fraction of a penny, others cost thousands of dollars. The
    tokens may or may not have some underlying value.

    the blockchain! Real jewels!” He is surrounded by goblets of glimmering jewels,
    and pours a gem-encrusted chalice of diamonds into a golden bucket. “Backed by
    the Queen herself!”

    It’s a magnificent opportunity.”

    and an overbite. “It’s a blockchain of blockchains, a derivative of derivatives.
    It’s a chain of coins in chains. It’s a chili cheese chain.” He gazes into the
    distance. “Okay, it’s a weed token.”

    tells you the questions to ask, and you get to keep asking until you get an answer
    in plain English.
  prefs: []

    the JewelCoin vendor and start grilling him. “You say it’s backed by the Queen
