    these days. Any trading is possible and successful whenevery information and database
    is factual, reliable and with the consent of all participants. It can be converted
    in to transparent across groups, safe and easy to use format with the help of
    Network management. Any market data needs to be protected and validated along
    with the technological advancement. A reliable distributed ledger helps in connecting
    suppliers, market, organizations, and consumers byresolving the issues of defining
    separate and multiple ledgers. Digital currencies are associated with blockchain.
    In supply chain management, blockchain and digital currencies has various applications
    types. Many participants are required to be managed in a Supply chain network.
    In the supply chain networks of smart organizations, a digital ledger can be developed
    to manage real time transactions and movements through blockchains for all the
    participants. In this chapter author has discussed the application of blockchain
    and digital currencies for better outcomes in a supply chain. The aim of this
    chapter is to assess the applicability of blockchains and to provide a foundation
    for researchers and practitioners to direct their future projects towards improving
    the applications and technology. This chapter also describes how smart contracts
    and ledgers can help in managing the overpriced gaps from procure – to-pay.

    technology. The blockchain can perceived as a game changer in bringing big transformation
    in the existing logistic, manufacturing and supply chain industry which seems
    to be transparent but complex. The supply chain solutions which are blockchain-enabled
    have drastically proven to minimize cost and improve eﬃciency in the supply chain
    industry. The complexity to create and distribute good makes a supply chain sequence
    a bit complex. Numerous stages and long-time duration in a supply chain involves
    large number of payments and invoices, geographical locations, people and entities

    and business can be restructured by optimal utilization of money, time, and efforts
    on several fronts. If there will be any fraud or perpetrate game in the system

    to deliver a product to market. Also, traditional operations emphasized more on
    activities such as procurement, maintenance, distribution, and inventory management.

    complex business requirements can be handled effectively by taking care of different
    requirements of different supply chains. The proper collaboration and supplier
    relationship is the success mantra for a successful and sustainable supply chain.
    As per discussed by Brammer and Walker, the most frequent occurring factor for
    Sustainable Supply Chain Management is the quality and depth of relationship between
    suppliers and the organizations [4]. According to Pagell and Wu, the best practice

    theory are being now used as prerogative practices in Sustainable Supply Chain
    Management theory [6]. Authors have also highlighted the difference between the
    traditional supply management and the necessity of partnerships in the modern
    day Researchers have conducted a case study analysis on a bag manufacturing company
    and found that applying reverse logistics or recycling techniques in the entire
    SC process can result in minimizing the product lead-time and supplier collaboration
    can boost sales and production eﬃciency. In contrast to power-based compliance
    partnerships, the trust among the supply chain actors is mandatory. Blome have

    each block is different from another block of chain in the form of information
    stored. A unique code called “hash” has been assigned to the information stored
    in a block. We can also imagine a blockchain as a ledger—because that is essentially
    how most blockchains function. Each block of data represents some new transaction
    on the ledger, whether that means a contract or a sale or whatever else uses a
    ledger for. A blockchain is a record of transactions. The people or companies
    using Blockchain can verify and make these transactions. These are important concepts

    information to its potential suppliers, it is more likely to find a better supplier
    that can offer a more preferable yield rate, reflecting a reliable supply along
    with high quality. The traceability glinted by Blockchain technology’s “proof
    of work” concept overcomes the information asymmetry issue among the participants
    along the supply chain. Considering, blockchain-savvy (or, broadly tech-savvy)
    consumers, we assume that the random demand can be boosted by BCT adoption—the

    successful BCT enabled supply chain. In the existing supply chain management,
    first step is to identify the ‘pain’ points. An effort for the consortium and
    optimal amount of time is to be deploying for Blockchain technology via an iterative

    of Blockchain and introduced the consensus mechanism and financial services intermediaries
    which helped in enhancing trust. However, this perspective should not be limited
    only into its monetary properties. Nowadays, Blockchain techniques are impacting
    society in all domains and attracting people due to essential value of Blockchain:
    Trustable, Decentralized, collectively maintain, open source database and Reliable
    and applications of Blockchain are expanding in all segments of life. People under
    the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created an online coin called Bitcoin. Submitting
    their white paperback in late 2008 and introducing the first code in early 2009,
    Nakamoto made bitcoin an electronic currency that could be sent to peers without
    the need for a central bank or other authority to use and modify a ledger, much
    less how it used virtual currency. Soon Bitcoin became the most effective way
    for financial transactions and Bitcoin proposal resolved many issues of conventional
    or other accounting methods [2, 22].'

    Bitcoin. Some work for a few hundred ‘altcoins’—some of the same money projects
    have different rules—and different systems like Ethereum or Ripple. In global
    record systems, a potentially disruptive and low-tech technology called Bitcoin
    has attracted investors of financial sectors due to its few unique and simple

    It was assumed that this technology will work on the basic principles of Bitcoin
    cryptocurrency but later few measures are added to its design to enhance its global
    visibility. Thus, continuous activities were done by algorithm researchers, cryptographers,
    and the computer scientist to evolve Blockchain gradually. This technology is
    not being utilized for digital payments, but this basic technology has potential
    to alter almost all major activities of supply chain. Important aspects such as
    reliability, financial differentiation, flexibility, and cyber-technology which
    are essentials parameters of supply chain are applicable in current conceptual
    framework.

    challenges of Blockchain. More innovation is required in terms of impact of BCT
    on supply chain performance and its design. We just cannot consider a normal firm
    that deals from its suppliers and sell products to tech-savvy customers for the
    assessment of success of BCT in supply chain. But we should analyze adoption of
    this technology for up-stream supply and down-stream customers as well. Any company
    looks for maximizing total profit by jointly managing— Ordering and production
    design, Blockchain design and dynamic pricing and selling.

    price, reduce order quantities and minimized the levels of target-inventory. Few
    special types of experience goods and credence goods got benefited by adopting
    BCT but others (search goods) may not prove beneficial. Considering the lifecycle
    of a typical experience good, we recommend the adoption of BCT as early as possible,
    and that it is adopted both to a higher degree and at an earlier stage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This early adoption generates more understanding on adoption of BCT to serve
    well for SCM. With certain modifications, our framework and solution ideas can
    also apply to other settings, especially when adopting a new technology for SCM,
    such as cloud computing, IoT, AI, etc. BCT provides a disruptive and state-of-the-art
    business solution in a variety of contexts within supply chain management, especially
    for those serving potential tech-savvy consumers. Although we have endeavored
    to consider the major features of BCT, there are some other compelling factors
    that need to be considered to enrich the research. As one potential future research
    project, blockchain technology could significantly shorten the lead times of transactions,
    as well as at the same time speed up both information processing times and paperwork
    processing. From a financial perspective, cash flow could become faster or even
    immediate by leveraging cryptocurrency ecosystems throughout its supply chain
    network. In this case, it will be of interest to study the impact of BCT on process
    expedition. In the future, blockchain solutions from different companies, or even
    industries, will be able to communicate and share digital assets with each other
    seamlessly.

    Interestingly, even organizations, like banks and governments, who would seem
    to be losing out, can see opportunities to use blockchain to streamline their
    own businesses. Of course, an in-depth transformation of supply chains will not
    happen instantly. However, supply chains can already start using a blockchain
    for small portions of their operations. Smart Contracts can help eliminate the
    costly delays and waste that is currently experienced due to the manual handling
    of paperwork. After that, the door is then open to a smarter, faster, more secure
    supply chain from one end to the other
