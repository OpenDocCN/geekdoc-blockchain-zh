- en: The research aims at streamlining the execution of the design phase by combining
    the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts. The construction industry is
    generally reluctant in accommodating new technologies, but with the promise of
    transforming information management, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is currently
    leading its digitalisation. Despite that, its adoption showed issues of information
    integrity and reliability. Misunderstanding about information requirements can
    cause delays, unforeseen costs and need for reworks. For these reasons, the chapter
    suggests the integration of information management based on BIM and blockchain,
    highlighting their prospective bond. The chapter illustrates the framework of
    the research that applies the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts in
    the design phase, pointing out their potential impact on the automation of information
    review, reduction of late deliveries and overdue payments. The architecture of
    the potential technological tools is presented and discussed. The research proposes
    a data-driven process, where all the essential information related to the design
    verification is recorded and where, at the automatic validation of each BIM model,
    the approval of payment release is issued automatically. The system intends to
    ensure full compliance with project information requirements and protect the contracting
    parties against potential late payment. The framework is still theoretical, however,
    the expected outcomes from its future test through a proof of concept are finally
    discussed.

- en: Since the construction sector is among those with the lowest degree of digitalisation,
    innovative methodologies and tools are identified as the drivers for the transformation
    of the traditional approach and the improvement of efficiency [[1](#CR1)]. The
    digital transformation, therefore, appears to be the first impulse for change
    [[2](#CR2)], and, in particular, the introduction of Building Information Modelling
    (BIM) has supported transparent project development, through the information management
    based on structured procedures and protocols. The production, review and maintenance
    of information in a structured digital environment foster exhaustive information
    sharing and collaboration among participants (see Sect. [2.1](#Sec2)) [[3](#CR3),
    [4](#CR4)]. With the promise of optimising the digital information management,
    BIM has led the growth of the digitalisation recently observed in the construction
    industry. Its implementation primarily aims at improving information definition
    and exchange. Secondly, it targets at eliminating the traditional information
    asymmetry that hinders compliance with requirements, transparent information sharing
    and consistency among the project documents. Despite the expectations, the adoption
    of BIM has shown problems related to the management of a considerable information
    flow. In particular, the issues are related to the attribution, reliability, integrity
    and accuracy of information exchanged during the process [[2](#CR2)]. Misunderstandings
    or ambiguities in the information requirements and produced information can cause
    delays, the need for reworks, and, consequently, unforeseen costs. [[5](#CR5),
    [6](#CR6)]. Recently, the existing literature has identified the application of
    blockchain technology as a stimulating area of research and testing in the construction
    industry [[3](#CR3), [7](#CR7), [8](#CR8)]. Further studies have also identified
    smart contracts as a valuable tool for optimising and automating some activities
    and payment systems [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)]. For these reasons, among the technological
    innovations that can positively enhance the digitalisation sector, the presented
    research proposes digital information management based on blockchain for entailing
    the reliability of information and for shortening and automating the process development
    through the use of smart contracts [[11](#CR11), [12](#CR12)]. Despite the hurdles,
    BIM is currently the most suitable solution for the collaborative and structured
    production, validation and management of information. Thus, blockchain can be
    a possible answer to the problem of information asymmetry and reliability in the
    design, tender, construction and maintenance phases [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)].
    Besides, the deployment of smart contracts ensures the programming and automatic
    execution of specific activities.

- en: Concerning these premises, the proposed framework of the research, through its
    future tangible development, intends to investigate the digital information management
    using BIM and blockchain to highlight their potential and useful link within the
    current digitalisation of the processes in the construction sector. In particular,
    the research objectives focus on both how the integration of blockchain in the
    information management using BIM could ensure the trustworthiness of information
    and how the integration between the automatic BIM validation and the implementation
    of smart contracts could shorten the time needed to carry out a specific work
    phase. Indeed, the automatic approval of the design through the integrated use
    of the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts could optimise the efficiency
    of the process by reducing late deliveries, due to the waiting times for the approval,
    and late payments, due to reworks or changes.

- en: The ambition to propose and develop a framework of the research that combines
    the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts to shorten the execution time
    of the design phase by automating approval procedures, is sustained by the analysis
    of European and Italian reports [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]. Firstly, late payments
    and long payment terms represent a challenge for the entire European economy,
    causing administrative and financial burdens, which can lead to disputes that
    affect business growth. Across the European Union, the construction sector appears
    to suffer the most from late payments [[16](#CR16)]. Differences in payment behaviour
    undermine the proper functioning of the industry and threaten increasingly the
    survival of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [[16](#CR16), [17](#CR17)].
    Certainly, the nature of the construction industry contributes to the unfair length
    of payment terms and the high number of delays. In particular, the causes of late
    payments are often directly linked to the behaviour of the construction companies
    and, in some cases, of the public authorities working with consultants. Faced
    with this situation, late payments have gained increasing attention among policymakers
    and private sector associations. Focusing on the Italian construction sector,
    a country-specific analysis reveals that public authorities in the industry tend
    to have longer than average payment terms, hence affecting the liquidity of consultants
    and companies. In 2017, almost 70% of companies declared payment delays by the
    public administration [[18](#CR18), [19](#CR19)]. The delays in payments come
    alongside the second main issue, namely late deliveries during the construction
    process. In particular, the Italian “Report on the implementation time of public
    works” [[15](#CR15)] highlights the long execution periods required to carry out
    the process phases (design, procurement, construction and maintenance). Specifically,
    the report highlights the incidence of the “waiting times”, i.e. the time interval
    between the end of one phase and the beginning of the following phase, on the
    total duration of each phase. The report points out that the overall design phase
    is most characterised by long waiting times between the end of one phase and the
    beginning of another, which negatively affect its total duration. Verification
    and validation procedures, authorisations and bureaucratic steps are the main
    causes of the cited waiting times during the design phase [[15](#CR15)].

    in the design phase. Regarding what stated so far, the research question that
    triggered the development of the framework of the research is about how the digital
    methodologies and tools could affect the reduction of late deliveries and overdue
    payments in the design phase. The proposed research framework provides a theoretical
    response to the above-mentioned question. It illustrates a process that, if concretely
    carried out, permits the distancing from the traditional practices ensuring the
    shortening of the process development and the satisfaction of the contracting
    parties. Further developments of the research will experience and demonstrate
    the framework through the implementation of a proof of concept, proving its validity
    and innovation.

- en: As anticipated, the research proposes the integration of the automatic BIM validation
    and smart contracts to automate and shorten the design phase development. The
    suggested framework of the research underlines the potential offered by the information
    management based on these technologies. In particular, the implementation of a
    BIM process based on blockchain could improve the information management thanks
    to the recording of any activity, constant monitoring of the progress, exhaustive
    verification and validation of the information requirements and identification
    of the responsible parties. This combination could give confidence and harmony
    to the information shared, produced, reviewed and stored. The framework could
    correspondingly improve the process execution and management. In the contractual
    environment typical of the construction sector, the opportunity of automating
    certain processes that are traditionally performed by interaction and pursued
    based on decisions promoted by agreement among multiple parties is a valid area
    for experimentation. To support and motivate the development of the framework,
    this section discusses two main topics. At first, the information management using
    BIM is illustrated with a focus on the procedures for the verification and validation
    of the information requirements. Then, the current areas of research on blockchain
    in construction, with a focus on digital information management, as well as the
    potential blockchain network to be adopted in the framework are discussed.

- en: The progressive digital transformation of information management is driving
    a revolution in the procedures during the overall construction process. In this
    context, both public and private clients are becoming interested in innovative
    practices that exploit information management to improve communication, efficiency,
    safety and productivity of the built environment. The digitalisation is stimulating
    greater automation of the design, tender, construction and maintenance phases,
    optimising the building life cycle and improving the client’s satisfaction and
    end-user’s experience [[20](#CR20)]. In this context, Building Information Modelling
    can be considered the methodology that is driving the digital transformation.
    As an approach based on digital information management, it can indeed be crucial
    for better decision-making, predictability and confidence in obtaining the expected
    results. It significantly influences the system of creating, collecting, using
    and sharing the digital information throughout the asset life cycle, involving
    all the stakeholders. The ISO 19650 series, as international standards that define
    digital information management procedures during the asset life cycle, encourages
    the introduction of BIM and uniformly guides the experts in its use [[21](#CR21)].
    ISO 19650 defines BIM as a beneficial method based on the better specification
    and digital delivery of the right amount of information about design, construction,
    operation and maintenance of an asset using appropriate technologies [[22](#CR22)].
    The information management process covers the activities of defining information
    requirements and the production, delivery and review of information. Within such
    a process, each participant is responsible for certain information management
    functions to be fulfilled. Each party engaged has, therefore, an involvement and
    interaction with information management according to their role and responsibilities.
    Indeed, ISO 19650 undertakes the identification of the main actors in the process,
    denoted as the appointing party, the lead appointed party and the appointed party(s)
    [[22](#CR22)]. The first, usually represented by the client, is the one who defines
    the information requirements. The second is the party responsible for the coordination
    of the exchanged information and the third is the one accountable for the information
    production. According to ISO 19650, to achieve a successful information management
    using BIM, each actor involved must fulfil three main tasks. The first is the
    clear definition of the information requirements, and standards for their production
    and review. The second is the proper production of the quantity and quality of
    the required information, and the third is the efficient and effective exchange
    of information among the involved parties. Specifically, the appointing party
    is the one who starts the process, stating the information requirements and ensuring
    their clear definition. This statement defines the type of information and clarifies
    how different types of information should be structured and exchanged. Then, each
    prospective lead appointed party responds to the information requirements stated,
    through the development of the BIM Execution Plan (BEP), which is considered by
    the appointing party when selecting the lead appointed party. After this stage,
    all the actors collaborate to agree on the key roles and responsibilities and
    arrange an information delivery plan that outlines coordination and delivery schemes.
    This allows the configuration of an appropriate information management, that provides
    and considers the requirements of the involved parties, the delivery process,
    and the use of appropriate technologies. At the end of every project stage, a
    review of the information produced is needed to validate the appropriate achievement
    of the information requirements. This review process is commonly performed through
    a mixture of manual and automated methods and applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The aforementioned definition of the information requirements is based on structured
    information management, allowing the explicit definition of the requirements,
    their availability to the different parties and the continuous review of their
    fulfilment [[23](#CR23)]. Each information produced must be reviewed to double-check
    the compliance with the information requirements and, consequently, accepted (or
    rejected). In this context, the ISO 19650 series [[22](#CR22)] outlines the client
    as the person in charge of defining the project objectives and information requirements
    and reviewing the information delivered for each phase of the asset life cycle.
    However, since ISO 19650 does not provide the organisation or project-specific
    details and considers the high level of client’s involvement, starting from the
    general standards recommended, the need of BIM guidelines containing the personalised
    client’s requirements has become progressively evident. The customisation of the
    standards allows the client to create proprietary BIM guidelines for the identification
    of the information requirements in a structured way and the regulation of subsequent
    procedures based on the specific needs. The customisation of procedures for organising
    the client’s needs boosts BIM to be integrated into the construction industry
    in a controlled and gradual manner. In particular, to guide large clients in the
    preparation of effective BIM guidelines [[20](#CR20)], ISO/TS 12911 supports the
    definition of personalised methods for information management [[24](#CR24)]. Indeed,
    ISO/TS 12911 provides a structured and reusable framework to guide the BIM process
    development [[24](#CR24)]. The suggested framework allows the creation of a common
    structure for the application of BIM and makes BIM guidelines manageable and testable.
    BIM guidelines are prepared and used for: (i) defining the desired information
    outputs and their expected quality, (ii) customising the structured implementation
    of project information, (iii) identifying the resources and tools and their appropriate
    management, (iv) obtaining and maintaining a common knowledge within the project
    and (v) supporting the technologies behind BIM. The preparation of proprietary
    BIM guidelines, before the start of the design phase, allows the client to develop
    the information requirements in a structured way and it is fundamental to ensure
    the contracting parties have a clear definition of all the types of information
    to be produced and managed [[25](#CR25)]. Since proprietary BIM guidelines are
    drafted by a specific client, they allow the standardisation and guidance of processes
    based on precise needs. For these reasons, the existing proprietary guidelines
    can differ widely from one another, in their goals, approach to standardisation,
    technology requirements and level of information needed [[26](#CR26)]. However,
    they are a powerful tool to promote and guide the adoption of information management
    using BIM. Since the generation of value in the construction industry depends
    on the identification, processing and fulfilment of the client’s requirements,
    the presence of specific guidelines can support the process development and guarantee
    the achievement of the requirements. BIM guidelines, regulating a structured information
    request, production, review and management in the BIM environment, enable the
    creation of coherent information among different participants, enhancing a transparent
    and collaborative workflow and reducing the event of information asymmetry or
    misunderstanding of the requirements.'

    The research environment is indeed located in the design phase required by a specific
    client (see Sect. [3](#Sec5)). The target client has proprietary BIM guidelines
    on which the design phase must be developed. Therefore, the first objective of
    the research is to identify an application able to automatically verify and validate
    the information included in BIM models in compliance with the client’s BIM guidelines
    and to outline its potential architecture and functioning (see Sect. [4.1](#Sec7)).

- en: Due to its growing interest, the introduction of blockchain technology has promoted
    new types of applications, and therefore it could be considered the main technology
    qualifying the digital transformation currently studied by the most advanced world
    economies [[27](#CR27), [28](#CR28)]. Belonging to the Distributed Ledger Technologies
    (DLTs), blockchain is defined as a *trustless* technology, that ensures an extraordinary
    degree of trustworthiness, integrity and immutability [[29](#CR29)] and that allows
    parties to send transactions using a peer-to-peer network, without the control
    of a trusted third party (TTP) [[30](#CR30), [31](#CR31)]. The creation and maintenance
    of trust are guaranteed by the design of the technology. The level of transparency,
    accessibility and traceability of information shared and stored using the technology
    is defined by its architecture design. Among DLTs, blockchain offers unique features,
    including a considerable number of use cases and the possibility to implement
    smart contracts. As previously stated, smart contracts will be an important topic
    of investigation and application in the presented research. Undeniably, according
    to some researchers, late payments in the construction industry led to several
    claims, but the adoption of smart contracts could significantly reduce the actual
    negative concerns [[32](#CR32)–[34](#CR34)]. The selection and configuration of
    the suitable blockchain network make it possible to draw up and execute smart
    contracts. Although smart contracts are automatic and deterministic, they are
    not perfectly *trustless*. Since blockchain cannot access data outside its network
    on its own, the main limitation with smart contracts is the communication with
    the real world. For these reasons, it is necessary to integrate a third-party
    system that allows access and verification of what is happening in the real world
    and sends the information to the blockchain via smart contracts. Such services
    are defined as oracles [[35](#CR35)]. In this way, the entire network can validate
    the request, and the contract is able to accept or reject it automatically. When
    the conditions comply with the planned process, smart contracts automatically
    execute, approving the release or directly issuing the payment [[36](#CR36)].
    The use of such services is of great importance to the framework of the research,
    since they can guarantee the connection of the external world, i.e. the information
    production and validation during the design phase, and the blockchain world, i.e.
    the recording of information and the automatic approval of the process stages.

- en: Thanks to the main benefits offered by the technology such as the transparency
    and immutability of information, which make it possible to limit the occurrence
    of misunderstandings, and the automation of the process, which guarantees the
    disbursement of payments and respect of the deliveries, the proposed research
    is placed among other emerging studies and experimentations related to the integration
    of the information management based on BIM and blockchain in the design phase.
    Indeed, the possibility to develop and maintain the information inside the BIM
    models using blockchain allows the recording of any activity, therefore controlling
    at any time the real progress of the considered phase and the responsible parties.
    The integration of blockchain in the BIM process gives confidence and synchronization
    to the information shared, produced, reviewed and stored. The information is stored
    on a distributed platform shared among all the participants, which allows the
    notarisation of each piece of information created, modified and updated as the
    process progresses. In this way, the progress of the process and the monitoring
    of the compliance with project objectives are known by both the client and all
    the involved appointed parties. In the existing literature, it is possible to
    recognise some different studies related to the adoption of blockchain in digital
    information management during the design phase. Dounas et al. proposed a framework
    for decentralised architectural design that allows multiple participants to solve
    the design problems in both collaborative and competitive ways and, thanks to
    the integration of blockchain, it is able to record all the design attempts, including
    the ones that have ‘failed’, and all the positive steps towards design optimisation
    [[12](#CR12)]. Schönhals et al. proposed an approach that makes it possible to
    protect developed ideas and early concepts even during their systematic development.
    It intends to protect the intellectual property through the digital record of
    verbal, written or sketched, and even modelled or constructed outcomes during
    the innovation development in real-time [[37](#CR37)]. Another work to be cited
    is from Zheng et al. that proposed an application for mobile devices that allowed
    users to check on their portable devices whether a BIM model is the latest version,
    whereby, a hash of the BIM model is stored on the blockchain that allows a search
    service to cross-check the hash of a downloaded model with the hash stored on
    the chain, after which, the application will provide users with a verification
    receipt that declares the validity of the model [[38](#CR38)].

    cutting-edge scope of the proposed research that intends to integrate and contribute
    to the current evolving research field. To identify the most appropriate network
    to support the framework of the research and configure its components, an analysis
    of different types of blockchain networks has been carried out. Even though blockchain
    technology was first designed for the deployment of public, *permissionless* and
    *trustless* network, which do not require the presence of a TTP, its design has
    progressed towards the creation of private and permissioned networks. In these
    networks, participation is permissioned. Participants have restrictions on writing
    rights (data validation) or/and reading rights (access to data). As the public
    networks, permissioned ones are immutable and nodes share the same ledger, but
    the access to the network is permissioned, this means that the role of each node
    has to be granted [[39](#CR39)].

    the design phase where a specific client appoints a design team to produce and
    manage information related to a specific project in compliance with BIM guidelines.
    For these reasons, the architecture of the blockchain network must be the response
    and balance the requirements of both the client and the contracting parties involved.
    Therefore, evaluating the structured environment in which the design process is
    implemented, the initial theoretical investigations of blockchain networks concern
    the permissioned ones. In order to set up a permissioned blockchain to support
    the research framework implementation, among the existing private networks [[40](#CR40)],
    Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) has been analysed and selected as the potential most
    suitable network to be configured and integrated in the framework of the research
    (see Sect. [4](#Sec6)). HLF, which is the most popular permissioned network, is
    well adjustable to a wide range of distributed applications written in general
    programming languages. For these reasons, companies that create and deploy blockchain
    applications within their businesses use it. The network consists of various peers
    that host blockchain, execute smart contracts and mutually maintain the state
    of the ledger. Smart contracts in HLF are called *chaincodes*, they can be shared
    by all entities within a company, or they can be shared privately and accessed
    by a specific group of entities [[40](#CR40)]. Smart contracts are executed only
    on nodes with which the network is shared, thus being inaccessible to others.
    The possibility of selecting specific nodes is guaranteed by the channel concept:
    information and smart contracts present in a specific channel are only accessible
    to the channel participants. In the network setup phase, the participating nodes
    are identified and authenticated, hence it is possible to identify if a certain
    node belongs to a certain channel. Currently, HLF supports Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM) bytecode smart contracts, allowing the contracts to be written and managed
    with the same tools of Ethereum, thus simplifying the configuration procedures.
    Based on the investigation of the existing literature [[39](#CR39), [40](#CR40)],
    Hyperledger Fabric is shown to be the network that performs better in terms of
    performance, architecture, and components, therefore it is the one identified
    to be potentially set up and tested in the framework of the research. Thanks to
    permissions, network participants are known and acknowledged when setting up and
    running the network. The adoption of blockchain technology in the development
    of the research will allow the creation of a network through which selected participants
    can share information transparently and perform transactions securely.'

    information management using BIM and blockchain could improve the engagement between
    the client and the design team. The use of a common digital environment allows
    participants to share and access the same information during the process. Its
    connection with blockchain enables information to become traceable and unchangeable,
    thus the trust among the parties increases. Indeed, the distributed environment
    can help in reducing the misunderstanding frequently due to discrepancies and
    non-conformities among the client’s requirements and the design team’s documents.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.png)

    development of the sector. As stated at the beginning of the section, the research
    framework delineates the performing process of the design phase, created on the
    adoption of innovative methods and technologies, which promise considerable benefits.
    The main purpose of the framework is, at the present time, limited to the automatic
    compliance of the client’s information requirements, therefore other verifications
    to be accomplished in the information models (such as code checking and clash
    detection) are out of the research scope. This means that the automatic payment
    release concerns the completion of one part of the overall BIM model checking
    expected for the final approval of the design documents. During the progress of
    the research, the framework could be extended and generalised to include other
    types of model verification and define the entire automation process for the validation
    of the BIM models.

- en: To show the business logic of the research, the dynamics of interaction among
    the parties and the use of innovative technological tools, here below an example
    of the application of the framework is explained step-by-step. With the commitment
    to verify the client’s information requirements during the execution of the design
    phase driven by the content of proprietary BIM guidelines, the process outlined
    is based on structured procedures for information management as recommended by
    the ISO 19650 series. As previously stated, the participants in the information
    production and management process have specific responsibilities and tasks. In
    the research case, the acting parties are the client, the design team and the
    verifier (Fig. [1](#Fig1)). The client, as the owner or for whom the project is
    carried out, must conduct all the activities to ensure that accurate information
    management is satisfied. Therefore, the client defines the project information
    requirements, protocols for information production, delivery milestones and sets
    a common data environment (CDE) solution to support the production, sharing and
    archiving of models and information among the interested parties. In compliance
    with what is stated in the ISO 19650 series and ISO/TS 12911, the client has personalised
    and set out the desired information requirements, protocols and milestones in
    the proprietary BIM guidelines. These guidelines are transmitted to the design
    team during the appointment process. Once the appointment has been awarded, the
    design team develops the project based on proprietary BIM guidelines content.
    The team produces all the information included in BIM models following the defined
    information requirements. In this way, the produced information will respond entirely
    to the requirements set out by the client, and therefore the design will be realised
    in a compliant and optimised way. Simultaneously with the development of the information
    models, the verifier, appointed by the client, also receives the proprietary BIM
    guidelines. The verifier is a consultant of the client that undertakes the detailed
    analysis of the guidelines to translate the information requirements from semantic
    language to machine-readable language through the configuration of adequate tools.
    Since the creation and management of a BIM project requires the production of
    a large amount of digital information, manual verifications are difficult to be
    performed objectively and exhaustively. For these reasons, to ensure that the
    information requirements are completely met, the verifier identifies a suitable
    application to develop automatic rulesets compliant with the content of the guidelines.
    Such a tool, which can be implemented in the modelling software, is capable of
    automatically and completely validating the information content produced according
    to the client’s requirements (see Sect. [4](#Sec6)). Once the production of information
    is completed, the design team delivers the BIM models produced for each project
    discipline (i. e. architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical) to the
    client. The delivered models are uniquely stored in the CDE solution, considered
    the off-chain database. The files stored in the CDE are also stored and linked
    with a blockchain network, using a distributed storage system, to keep track of
    the model delivery cycle. Due to the large size of the models, the system creates
    for each delivered BIM model a cryptographic hash that is stored in the blockchain
    network through smart contracts. The hash added to the blockchain network enables
    the inspection of the mapped BIM model that is stored on the computer memory of
    the peer with the same name as the hash. This makes it possible to control access
    and changes to the BIM models in a uniform and secure way. When a new model is
    delivered, its hash and the hash of the already stored models are compared. This
    makes it possible to check transparently both that the same model has been delivered
    twice and that the model, claimed to have been revised after validation procedures,
    has not been modified.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following the delivery procedure, the verifier uses the programmed application
    to automatically verify and validate the information included in the BIM models.
    For each model verified, the application independently produces a report containing
    the results of the verification. The created reports are stored in the CDE and,
    likely for the models, their hashes are recorded on the blockchain network hence
    the progress of the modelling process could be recorded and mapped transparently.
    In this environment, project verification and validation activities are managed
    evidently, improving the communication between the client and the design team.
    The automatic validation of the information speeds up and optimises the review
    and delivery process. The archiving of results allows the client to assess the
    compliance with the information requirements. This framework also ensures the
    absence of non-conformities and disputes during the phase progress. The outcome
    of the report reveals the compliance of the information produced with the client’s
    requirements and the timing of the delivery. The level of compliance for which
    the delivered models are approved is defined at the beginning by the client and
    communicated to the design team at the time of the appointment. The automatic
    validation of information included in the models takes place separately for each
    discipline, so four separate reports are created for each verification cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the automatic verification of information models produces a report with a
    result that is below the set level of compliance, the design team receives the
    report containing all the detected non-conformities and it must proceed with the
    changes and indicated corrections. The design team must then subsequently make
    a new delivery. If, on the other hand, the set level of compliance is met, i.e.
    information produced has met the client’s information requirements, the model
    is accepted and stored in the CDE, for the future steps towards construction and/or
    building operation and maintenance. Therefore, the automatic validation process,
    connected to a blockchain network, is combined with the automation of contractual
    performance through the adoption of a smart contract between the client and the
    design team. Since blockchain cannot retrieve directly external information, an
    oracle is required to create the connection between the smart contract and the
    off-chain data source. At the time of the appointment, the client and the design
    team have established the terms and conditions of payment approval upon the completion
    of the assigned tasks. These conditions impose the authorisation for the release
    of payment when the delivered models’ verification lines up to the set level of
    compliance. To automate this approval process and link it directly to the results
    of the model verification, the payment conditions are translated into a smart
    contract. Therefore, a back-end oracle ensures the connection between the verification
    report’s result and blockchain to transmit and store the result in an oracle smart
    contract. The data stored in the oracle smart contract can be retrieved by the
    smart contract for payment that compares whether the level of compliance achieved
    is equal to or greater than the established level and, if so, initiates the transaction.
    The smart contract for payment is linked with an escrow account, that holds and
    only disburses funds when the task is completed as expected, ensuring the payment
    release to the design team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pursued business logic makes the coded payment conditions self-execute at
    the end of each verification cycle of the information model, if the level of compliance
    is equal to or higher than the one set by the client. Indeed, in each model verification
    cycle, the application operation reports the type of model verified, the time
    of verification and the level of compliance reached and automatically compares
    it with the set level agreed upon between the parties. This process incentivises
    the participants to perform their assigned tasks as stated under the contract.
    Information produced and included in the BIM models is developed by observing
    the client’s requirements and the design team is approved for payments through
    a smart contract for each completed delivery step. Therefore, the design cycle,
    and the subsequent validation, is an iterative process. Design information models
    are only approved when they meet the information requirements contained in the
    proprietary BIM guidelines. Only when the outcome of the report equals or exceeds
    the defined threshold of the level of compliance allowing the verification flag,
    the model is archived and the payment for the activity is automatically approved.

- en: Information production, review, validation and management underlying the research
    framework are accomplished with the agreement of the information requirements
    made clear by the client in the proprietary BIM guidelines. As stated above, the
    scope of the research is limited to the design phase, where a client plays the
    role of the appointing party, requiring the production and management of digital
    information in accordance with its BIM guidelines. The proposed framework of the
    research is developed to test its operation, validity and innovation tangibly
    on a project briefly presented in Sect. [3](#Sec5), considered as the proof of
    concept of the research. For these reasons the software requested by the client
    and used by the design team for the realisation of the models in the design phase
    is known and it is the Autodesk Revit authoring tool. Consequently, the application
    identified to perform the automatic validation of the digital information must
    be able to communicate with that modelling software. Among the Revit applications
    that permit the performance of personalised checks on BIM models, Autodesk Model
    Checker for Revit has been chosen as it allows the creation of customisable verification
    and validation rulesets for data and naming conventions checks. The progressive
    digitisation of information during the project development has caused a significant
    increase in its quantity and complexity. BIM models can be defined as repositories
    of all project information that must comply with the information requirements
    expressed by the client [[22](#CR22), [24](#CR24)]. Indeed, according to the international
    standards, information produced and managed during the project development must
    be verified at the end of each planned phase of the process. In the context of
    the research, the review and validation of information produced and included in
    the BIM models, therefore, becomes a fundamental activity to achieve the compliance
    with the guidelines content.

- en: The setting up of an application for the automatic information validation becomes
    crucial as frequently the verification of the BIM models is manually implemented.
    This activity is time-consuming and error-prone, with the plausible generation
    of disputes and discontent in the subsequent phases. Since these operations for
    verification demonstrate to be critical, the creation of an automated BIM validation
    process is vital in the digital information management. To start solving these
    issues, the first objective of the research is the description of the tool-operating
    framework for the information validation. Aiming at giving greater reliability
    and integrity to the information review process, the overall approach defined
    to validate the activities of the BIM models is illustrated in Fig. [2](#Fig2).
    The approach is implemented starting from the analysis and interpretation of the
    proprietary BIM guidelines. The client uses a semantic language to define the
    information requirements for the design and, to integrate them in an application
    for automatic validation, they must be translated into a machine-readable language
    that can be interpreted by the chosen software (i.e. Autodesk Model Checker Configurator).
    The mediation between the two languages takes place through a domain-oriented
    language, whose terms allow a simple and immediate definition of the domain in
    which professionals operate. The identified application does not modify the information
    model to be analysed, however based on rulesets, it reports any error messages
    if the model presents inconsistencies with respect to the domain. The rulesets
    consist of the translation of the guidelines information requirements and represent
    the verification domain.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png)

- en: 'Therefore, the functioning logic of the automatic verification is based on
    the creation of a validation domain (i.e. the content of the guidelines) used
    as a reference to verify that the model falls within this domain. The rulesets
    implementation in the BIM models generates the result “approved” or “rejected”
    for each verified requirement. The rulesets are in fact implemented and executed
    in each BIM model (i.e. architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical),
    concluding an exhaustive verification cycle. The activity ends with the production,
    for each BIM model, of a report containing the results of the verification. The
    reports contain all errors and inconsistencies between information contained in
    the models and the information requirements contained in the proprietary BIM guidelines.
    The approach for the setup of the automatic information validation process starts
    with the identification of the content of the proprietary BIM guidelines to be
    translated and included in the application and with the definition of the general
    organisation to be respected for the setup of each ruleset. Since the amount of
    information is increased due to the digital transformation of the construction
    process, the information requirements established by the client are abundant.
    In particular, the content of the proprietary BIM guidelines of the selected project
    can be divided into three macro-categories of information requirements to be verified:
    (i) BIM objects naming conventions, (ii) BIM model templates naming conventions
    and (iii) BIM object parameters. In the first category are defined, for each discipline
    (i.e. architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical), the naming conventions
    of the BIM model, the designations of loadable families, system families and their
    types, the designations of sheets and materials. In the second category, for each
    discipline, the naming conventions of the levels, views (drawings, fronts, and
    sections), schedules and grids are defined. Finally, the third category defines
    the association of the parameters with each object and their value. Evaluated
    the significant content of the proprietary BIM guidelines, the work related to
    the interpretation and translation of the information requirements using the Autodesk
    Model Checker for Revit application is undoubtedly onerous. The operating framework
    of the application has to involve the two macro-categories of rulesets identified
    for each discipline, namely one related to all naming conventions rules and the
    other related to rules for parameters. Through the support of the chosen application,
    these two macro rulesets are translated from semantic language to machine-readable
    language to be implemented in the BIM models.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this way, each rule to be included in the larger ruleset founding the verification
    domain is created. Each verification ruleset is then implemented in the model,
    and at the end of the performance of the application, the verification report,
    containing the errors detected, is automatically obtained. In order to display
    a tangible example, Fig. [3](#Fig3) shows the implementation and verification
    of a rule within a structural BIM model developed in accordance with the proprietary
    BIM guidelines to test the automatic verification tool. The implemented rule intends
    to verify the naming conventions of the structural wall types and, at the end
    of the performance, the verification report is obtained. The report is detailed
    for each identified element. In this case, two types of structural wall, compared
    to those included in the structural BIM model, are detected with different names
    from the guidelines. The percentage of compliance between the naming conventions
    applied for the wall types used in the structural model and the naming conventions
    defined in the client’s requirements, according to the application report is 82%.
    As this illustration intends to show, as an example, only the verification of
    the naming convention of the structural wall types, the 82% obtained represents
    the level of compliance of the model related to a single information requirement,
    and not to the overall content of the BIM guidelines. Figure [3](#Fig3) illustrates
    that for each rejected element the report shows the ID, thus facilitating its
    rapid identification in the model and appropriate correction. Through the brief
    illustration of the architecture setup of the chosen application, it is possible
    to understand that, once the logical process has been defined, the exhaustive
    realisation of the rulesets in the application initially requires time to be invested
    in its creation and definition nevertheless it saves a lot of time in the future
    design and verification processes.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig3_HTML.png)

- en: As illustrated for the automatic validation of information included in the BIM
    models, the second main objective of the research framework is the definition
    of the architecture of the potential blockchain network selected. Section [2.2](#Sec4)
    indicates Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) as the potential blockchain network to be evaluated.
    As previously declared, the research project is contextualised in a proprietary
    environment. For this reason, the identification and the future use of a network
    that stands out for identity management, privacy and efficient processing are
    shown to be appropriate. From a technological point of view, the key features
    of HLF architecture include (i) identity management, (ii) channels, (iii) ledger,
    (iv) consensus mechanism, (v) smart contracts and (vi) policies. Unlike *permissionless*
    networks, where unknown identities participate in the network, HLF enrols members
    via the assignment of a digital identity certificate, that manages user IDs and
    enables the authentication of all the network participants, creating an access
    control list [[41](#CR41)]. In this way, privacy becomes a key requirement for
    the functioning of the network in which parties, known to each other, exchange
    sensitive and confidential information. By creating channels, participants can
    form groups to create different transaction ledgers. The channel enables the exchange
    of information (transactions) to a set of peers (participants), pursuant to the
    agreed policies. The creation of private channels enables any groups that require
    confidential transactions to coexist on the same permissioned network. As a blockchain
    network, the HLF ledger is immutable, and it encodes the history and current state
    of transactions in each channel. There is one ledger for each channel and each
    peer keeps a copy of the ledger for each channel in which it is a member. In HLF
    the consensus mechanism is chosen by the network to identify the one that best
    represents the type of relationships existing among the participants. The consensus
    mechanism allows the network to verify the correctness of transactions included
    in a block. The consensus is achieved when the order and result of the transactions
    in a block satisfy the policies of the network. The use of endorsement policies
    is what differentiates HLF from other blockchains. In fact, HLF models the actual
    world more realistically, so transactions must be validated by trusted parties
    of the network. The endorsement policies are associated with each *chaincode*
    that, in HLF, represents smart contracts (see Sect. [2.2](#Sec4)). Each smart
    contract allows the encoding of the logic with which a certain type of transaction
    is invoked on the channel. Other policies exist, e.g. relating to who can query
    or update the ledger, or who can add or remove participants. Finally, HLF can
    manage assets that represent tangible or non-tangible values through which almost
    anything with monetary value is exchanged on the network.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The above overview facilitates the understanding of the possible HLF architecture
    suggested for the research framework. Indeed, regarding the key features described
    and the parties pinpointed in the high-level framework (Fig. [1](#Fig1)), the
    components of HLF that define and determine the capabilities of the system are
    here identified and illustrated in the consecutive order of creation (Fig. [4](#Fig4)).
    In particular, the participants are the parties involved in the blockchain network,
    the assets are the values exchanged between the participants and the transactions
    are the logical smart contracts that specify certain events of the process and
    control its development. Thanks to identity management, each participant is identified
    reliably with a name and unique ID. Through the privacy of the network, accesses
    are controlled based on the roles of each participant that, in this environment,
    are known to each other. Each asset is recognised with name, ID and type. Likewise,
    each transaction is defined with a unique ID, name, timestamp and sender. Policies
    and rules based on consensus are defined and checked before each transaction takes
    place.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig4_HTML.png)

    the transactions to declare them valid. Only valid transactions can indeed update
    the state of the ledger. In the research, this policy is mainly entrusted to the
    client who is responsible for validating the transactions. The design team proposes
    the transaction for the BIM models delivery and the verifier proposes the one
    for the verification report produced. The second policy concerns the responsibility
    of updating and querying the ledger. In the research, the design team and verifier
    are the parties primarily responsible for updating and maintaining the data in
    the ledger, while the client can query to retrieve point-in-time data. The identification
    of the elements and logic of the HLF network to be implemented in the research
    allows a complete picture of the integration and operation architecture of the
    technologies involved in the system. Since the scope of the proposed framework
    is the combination of the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts, the architecture
    requires the implementation of oracles. The introduction of an oracle requires
    the creation of a dedicated channel, namely the global channel, in which a network
    participant operates as the trusted person responsible for maintaining and updating
    the ledger with external sources. This channel is provided with an oracle smart
    contract that updates the network and that can be queried for the updated data
    (Fig. [5](#Fig5)).![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig5_HTML.png)

- en: The participants, operating in the other channel, can indeed query the ledger
    to consult and obtain certain updated information. As already explained, the process
    starts with the definition of the client’s information requirements through proprietary
    BIM guidelines. Then, the BIM models developed by the design team, based on the
    guidelines, are submitted and automatically verified by the verifier, through
    the use of the setup application. The verification automatically produces a validation
    report containing the level of compliance achieved. The report, containing the
    indication of the model verified, the date of the verification, the failed elements
    and the percentage of compliance, represents the external data source to be connected
    to the blockchain network (i.e. the smart contract protocol) because it is produced
    by a tool external to the network. The verifier, as the supervisor of the verification
    activity, operates in the global channel representing the trusted provider of
    data. The verifier is indeed authorised by rules and policy to invoke the update
    of the ledger with the validation report. The smart contract deployed on the global
    channel, requests the external data and provides an update and a query transaction.
    From the other channel, namely the client-design team channel, the client can
    then invoke the smart contract which, exploiting the cross-channel query capability,
    retrieves the latest updated value. The smart contracts logic is activated, verifying
    that the value of the external source is equal to or greater than the established
    compliance level. If this is the case the logic executes, in compliance with rules
    based on consensus, issuing the approval to release the payment. This means that
    the smart contract logic setup executes the given instructions if some other given
    conditions are met. It could repeatedly verify the condition established (the
    achievement of the set level of compliance) and only perform the planned action
    when the condition has been met (BIM model has reached the set level of compliance).

- en: Through the automatic validation of the information content of the BIM models
    and the application of smart contracts, the research framework aims at shortening
    the execution time of the design phase, ensuring the fulfilment of the client’s
    requirements and the approval for the release of payment to the design team. Due
    to the increased complexity of the projects, the information requirements achievement
    and late payments are relevant factors in the trend of the industry [[1](#CR1)].
    The presented framework of the research is still at its theoretical level, in
    Sect. [3](#Sec5) the project on which the framework will be tangibly tested as
    a proof of concept has been anticipated. The future testing of the framework and
    the analysis of the results obtained will indeed be the next steps of the proposed
    research development. Therefore, in this section, the expected outcomes are disclosed
    and discussed, and their identification can be considered as a benchmark for comparing
    the future results. The main purpose of the framework relies on the integration
    between the information management based on BIM and the blockchain network to
    improve the link between the client and the design team, in the design phase.
    The combined environment presented in the research enables contracting parties
    to produce, review and maintain the same information exhaustively. Using the focus
    on process automation, the activities of controlling and validating the information,
    as well as those of approving the payment release, are executed by coded applications
    instead of humans’ implemented procedures. This innovative approach boosts the
    shortening of the design phase execution, facilitates the control of any rework
    and ensures the approval for the release of payments when the contractual conditions
    are met.

- en: The information management practices recommended by the ISO 19650 series promote
    constant interaction among the parties in the process. The information management
    based on BIM is characterised by the complete exchange of digital information
    whose revisions are dynamically reported and integrated, improving control over
    the project's progress and reducing non-conformities. Due to the high information
    content of BIM models, it is appropriate to adopt applications that automatically
    detect errors and non-conformities, facilitating a positive response to the client’s
    information requirements. Once all information included in the BIM models is completed,
    it is necessary to proceed with its verification to confirm compliance with the
    guidelines’ requirements. As earlier underlined, in the BIM environment the validation
    of information produced by the design team becomes a fundamental activity for
    the respect  of the client’s requirements. Indeed, the imprecise execution of
    this activity would not only have a negative effect on the project development
    and management, nevertheless, it would also generate potentially costly inaccuracies,
    therefore, necessarily to be avoided. To support this task, the development of
    an application that allows the automatic verification of information becomes crucial
    to check comprehensively the compliance with the BIM guidelines.

- en: With the aim of automatically and digitally validating the fulfilment of the
    client’s information requirements, the architecture of the application was developed
    through four main activities. Thanks to the first tests of this application, some
    expected benefits can be summarised. Firstly, the setup of an application for
    automatic information validation could provide the client with an effective tool
    for reviewing carefully the information produced by the design team. The adoption
    of such a verification process supports the improvement of the communication between
    the client and the design team. The validation of information produced during
    the design phase is no longer a manual, time-consuming and jagged activity, in
    fact it becomes comprehensive and detailed. Secondly, the design team would, therefore,
    be encouraged to produce information in compliance with the client’s information
    requirements to reduce working time and the likelihood of rework. At the same
    time, in the event of a negative review result, obtaining a detailed report containing
    all the rejected elements facilitates the design team in implementing targeted
    and fast corrections and supplementations. Finally, the client can monitor the
    actual progress of the project and the accuracy of the design teams. The detailed
    verification of the models ensures that the information requirements are met,
    and the automation of the process considerably reduces the traditional verification
    and validation time. Based on some initial experimentations, a statistical comparison
    between the time spent to verify the project using the traditional process and
    the automated one shows a time reduction of nearly 60% with a sample of two buildings
    (Fig. [6](#Fig6)). The BIM models related to these buildings were developed by
    the external design teams for the real digitalisation of the real estate assets
    requested and initiated by RAI. The BIM models are related to office buildings
    and recording studios, and their surface is about 15000sqm for project A and 12000 sqm
    for project B. For each BIM model, the appointed design teams developed four BIM
    models covering the four main disciplines. To highlight the innovative value of
    the automatic verification proposed in the research, the verifications of these
    models were carried out in both manual and automatic ways, in compliance with
    the two macro-categories of rule sets illustrated in Sect. [4.1](#Sec7). The statistical
    analysis will be further developed and improved during the evolution of the research.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig6_HTML.png)

    requires an appropriate selection and configuration. Among the possible types
    of blockchains, the permissioned ones were considered the most suitable types
    of networks for the research, which is set in a proprietary environment. Hyperledger
    Fabric was proposed as it is built for enterprise business. The permissioned network
    allows only selected participants to collaborate and transact, indeed network
    participants are known and acknowledged when setting up and running the network.
    This network guarantees privacy and the control of identity. Thanks to the correspondence
    between the digital identities and the social ones of each peer, the private network
    is easier to be implemented in the real scene than the public one, with higher
    operating efficiency, better transactions performance and lower costs [[42](#CR42)].
    In the explored design phase, the use of such a network allows the client to filter
    accesses, identify participants and guarantee the privacy and security of communication
    and information exchange. To set up and test the identified network in the research,
    its architecture was defined by pinpointing the working channel, participants,
    assets and expected transactions. The goal of automating both the validation of
    information included in BIM models and the consequent approval of the release
    of the payment, using smart contracts, highlighted the need to reliably connect
    the BIM process with the blockchain network. The import of external data into
    blockchain is made using an oracle, able to connect in a trusted way the application
    previously defined for the automatic BIM validation and the automatic business
    logic at the basis of the smart contract. This means that a participant, in this
    case, the verifier of the BIM models, becomes the trusted organisation operating
    in a separate channel. Only the oracle is authorised to post updates to the oracle
    smart contract, these updates would be the external data related to the results
    of the automatic validation. Since the oracle added operates in a different channel,
    the smart contract between the client and the design team would access the desired
    data (i.e. the validation report) via an inter-channel smart contract query.

    expected advantages. Firstly, the integration of a blockchain network in the general
    framework supports the implementation of automated activities. This means that
    the network can come along with the information management in the design phase,
    eliminating any intermediaries and ensuring the confidentiality of shared information
    using consensus protocols and smart contracts. Secondly, the smart contract between
    the client and the design team would assure the contracting party of the client’s
    willingness to pay and the certain delivery of payment upon automatic approval.

- en: 'In this theoretical stage of the research, a permissioned network was chosen
    because, from an architectural and functional point of view, it offers the appropriate
    network for the environment of the framework of the research. In addition, considering
    the selected real project, this choice was made to avoid the problems related
    to the public visualisation of information and the operating costs due to the
    fees for using a public network. During the actual development of the blockchain
    network for the proof of concept, it will be possible that other types of networks
    will be considered, investigated and tested as well as the possible link with
    a public blockchain, to maintain the nature and original meaning of the technology.
    The possible adoption of a public network should consider the organisational,
    economic and regulatory problems, and also analyse possible alternative solutions
    capable of minimising the operating costs. The system that better will truly perform
    and respond to the research objectives will be the one chosen and used during
    the implementation of the proof of concept in the future research development.
    To conclude, the main expected outcomes are related to: (i) the growth of the
    process efficiency, (ii) the improvement of information production, review and
    validation, (iii) the increased automation of procedures and (iv) the respect
    for delivery times and release of payments.'

- en: The presented framework of the research intends to demonstrate that the advent
    of new technologies could support positively the digitalisation of the construction
    industry. The proposed framework illustrates how the adoption of the automatic
    BIM validation and smart contracts could streamline and shorten the design phase
    execution. The chapter points out the integration between the information management
    based on BIM and blockchain as a solution to the weaknesses of the client’s requirements
    fulfilment, reliable information review and validation, and late payments. The
    combination of the two technologies offers enormous value and could be considered
    an appropriate direction for the efficient development of the design phase, thus
    attracting industry players. The potential offered by the framework could fully
    exploit the information of a BIM-based project. During the discussion of the expected
    outcomes, it was briefly shown how the automated verification of the information
    contained in the BIM models can significantly reduce the time taken to verify
    the project in compliance with the client’s information requirements. The application
    of the automatic design validation would allow, through the integration and use
    of blockchain, to automate the entire process until complete validation and this
    would be demonstrated through the development and testing of the proof of concept.
    Further developments of the research could involve the validation of the framework
    for the other verification procedures such as clash detection and code checking,
    so that the approved BIM models could be used as a legal reference both in the
    tender and construction phase, as a reference for monitoring the fulfilment of
    all the project requirements and specifications, or in the maintenance and operational
    phase, as an updated database of the building life cycle.
