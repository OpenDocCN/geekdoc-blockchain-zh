  zh: 摘要
- en: The research aims at streamlining the execution of the design phase by combining
    the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts. The construction industry is
    generally reluctant in accommodating new technologies, but with the promise of
    transforming information management, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is currently
    leading its digitalisation. Despite that, its adoption showed issues of information
    integrity and reliability. Misunderstanding about information requirements can
    cause delays, unforeseen costs and need for reworks. For these reasons, the chapter
    suggests the integration of information management based on BIM and blockchain,
    highlighting their prospective bond. The chapter illustrates the framework of
    the research that applies the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts in
    the design phase, pointing out their potential impact on the automation of information
    review, reduction of late deliveries and overdue payments. The architecture of
    the potential technological tools is presented and discussed. The research proposes
    a data-driven process, where all the essential information related to the design
    verification is recorded and where, at the automatic validation of each BIM model,
    the approval of payment release is issued automatically. The system intends to
    ensure full compliance with project information requirements and protect the contracting
    parties against potential late payment. The framework is still theoretical, however,
    the expected outcomes from its future test through a proof of concept are finally
    discussed.

  zh: 1 引言
- en: Since the construction sector is among those with the lowest degree of digitalisation,
    innovative methodologies and tools are identified as the drivers for the transformation
    of the traditional approach and the improvement of efficiency [[1](#CR1)]. The
    digital transformation, therefore, appears to be the first impulse for change
    [[2](#CR2)], and, in particular, the introduction of Building Information Modelling
    (BIM) has supported transparent project development, through the information management
    based on structured procedures and protocols. The production, review and maintenance
    of information in a structured digital environment foster exhaustive information
    sharing and collaboration among participants (see Sect. [2.1](#Sec2)) [[3](#CR3),
    [4](#CR4)]. With the promise of optimising the digital information management,
    BIM has led the growth of the digitalisation recently observed in the construction
    industry. Its implementation primarily aims at improving information definition
    and exchange. Secondly, it targets at eliminating the traditional information
    asymmetry that hinders compliance with requirements, transparent information sharing
    and consistency among the project documents. Despite the expectations, the adoption
    of BIM has shown problems related to the management of a considerable information
    flow. In particular, the issues are related to the attribution, reliability, integrity
    and accuracy of information exchanged during the process [[2](#CR2)]. Misunderstandings
    or ambiguities in the information requirements and produced information can cause
    delays, the need for reworks, and, consequently, unforeseen costs. [[5](#CR5),
    [6](#CR6)]. Recently, the existing literature has identified the application of
    blockchain technology as a stimulating area of research and testing in the construction
    industry [[3](#CR3), [7](#CR7), [8](#CR8)]. Further studies have also identified
    smart contracts as a valuable tool for optimising and automating some activities
    and payment systems [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)]. For these reasons, among the technological
    innovations that can positively enhance the digitalisation sector, the presented
    research proposes digital information management based on blockchain for entailing
    the reliability of information and for shortening and automating the process development
    through the use of smart contracts [[11](#CR11), [12](#CR12)]. Despite the hurdles,
    BIM is currently the most suitable solution for the collaborative and structured
    production, validation and management of information. Thus, blockchain can be
    a possible answer to the problem of information asymmetry and reliability in the
    design, tender, construction and maintenance phases [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)].
    Besides, the deployment of smart contracts ensures the programming and automatic
    execution of specific activities.

  zh: 由于建筑行业是数字化程度最低的行业之一，因此创新方法和工具被确定为传统方法转型和提高效率的驱动力[[1](#CR1)]。因此，数字化转型似乎是改变的第一个冲动[[2](#CR2)]，特别是引入建筑信息模型（BIM）通过基于结构化程序和协议的信息管理支持透明项目开发。在结构化数字环境中生产、审核和维护信息促进了参与者之间的全面信息共享和合作（参见第[2.1](#Sec2)节）[[3](#CR3),
    [4](#CR4)]。BIM的推广承诺优化数字信息管理，最近观察到建筑行业数字化的增长。其主要实施目标在于改善信息定义和交换。其次，它旨在消除传统的信息不对称，以此阻碍满足要求、透明的信息共享和项目文件间的一致性。尽管期望很高，BIM的采用出现了与在过程中交换的大量信息相关的问题。特别是这些问题与信息的属性、可靠性、完整性和准确性有关[[2](#CR2)]。信息需求和生产信息中的误解或模糊可能导致延迟，需要重新操作，从而产生意想不到的成本[[5](#CR5),
    [6](#CR6)]。最近，现有文献确定了区块链技术在建筑行业中作为一个激动人心的研究和测试领域[[3](#CR3), [7](#CR7), [8](#CR8)]。进一步研究还确定了智能合约作为优化和自动化某些活动和支付系统的有价值工具[[9](#CR9),
    [10](#CR10)]。因此，在可以积极提升数字化行业的技术创新中，所提出的研究提议基于区块链的数字化信息管理，以确保信息的可靠性，并通过智能合约的使用缩短和自动化流程的开发[[11](#CR11),
    [12](#CR12)]。尽管存在障碍，BIM目前是最适合的用于信息的协作和结构化生产、验证和管理的解决方案。因此，区块链可以是解决设计、招标、施工和维护阶段中的信息不对称和可靠性问题的可能答案[[13](#CR13),
    [14](#CR14)]。此外，部署智能合约可以确保特定活动的编程和自动执行。
- en: Concerning these premises, the proposed framework of the research, through its
    future tangible development, intends to investigate the digital information management
    using BIM and blockchain to highlight their potential and useful link within the
    current digitalisation of the processes in the construction sector. In particular,
    the research objectives focus on both how the integration of blockchain in the
    information management using BIM could ensure the trustworthiness of information
    and how the integration between the automatic BIM validation and the implementation
    of smart contracts could shorten the time needed to carry out a specific work
    phase. Indeed, the automatic approval of the design through the integrated use
    of the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts could optimise the efficiency
    of the process by reducing late deliveries, due to the waiting times for the approval,
    and late payments, due to reworks or changes.

  zh: 关于这些前提，通过未来的具体发展，提出的研究框架意在研究使用BIM和区块链进行数字信息管理，以突显它们在建筑行业当前数字化流程中的潜力和有用链接。具体来说，研究目标集中在区块链在使用BIM进行信息管理中如何确保信息的可信度，以及自动BIM验证与智能合约的整合如何缩短执行特定工作阶段所需的时间。实际上，通过自动BIM验证和智能合约的整合使用来自动批准设计，可以通过减少等待批准的等待时间和减少重新提交或更改导致的延迟交付，从而优化流程的效率。
- en: The ambition to propose and develop a framework of the research that combines
    the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts to shorten the execution time
    of the design phase by automating approval procedures, is sustained by the analysis
    of European and Italian reports [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]. Firstly, late payments
    and long payment terms represent a challenge for the entire European economy,
    causing administrative and financial burdens, which can lead to disputes that
    affect business growth. Across the European Union, the construction sector appears
    to suffer the most from late payments [[16](#CR16)]. Differences in payment behaviour
    undermine the proper functioning of the industry and threaten increasingly the
    survival of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [[16](#CR16), [17](#CR17)].
    Certainly, the nature of the construction industry contributes to the unfair length
    of payment terms and the high number of delays. In particular, the causes of late
    payments are often directly linked to the behaviour of the construction companies
    and, in some cases, of the public authorities working with consultants. Faced
    with this situation, late payments have gained increasing attention among policymakers
    and private sector associations. Focusing on the Italian construction sector,
    a country-specific analysis reveals that public authorities in the industry tend
    to have longer than average payment terms, hence affecting the liquidity of consultants
    and companies. In 2017, almost 70% of companies declared payment delays by the
    public administration [[18](#CR18), [19](#CR19)]. The delays in payments come
    alongside the second main issue, namely late deliveries during the construction
    process. In particular, the Italian “Report on the implementation time of public
    works” [[15](#CR15)] highlights the long execution periods required to carry out
    the process phases (design, procurement, construction and maintenance). Specifically,
    the report highlights the incidence of the “waiting times”, i.e. the time interval
    between the end of one phase and the beginning of the following phase, on the
    total duration of each phase. The report points out that the overall design phase
    is most characterised by long waiting times between the end of one phase and the
    beginning of another, which negatively affect its total duration. Verification
    and validation procedures, authorisations and bureaucratic steps are the main
    causes of the cited waiting times during the design phase [[15](#CR15)].

  zh: 提出并开发将自动BIM验证和智能合同结合起来，以缩短设计阶段的执行时间，通过自动批准程序，这一研究框架的雄心受到了欧洲和意大利报告的支持[[15](#CR15),
    [16](#CR16)]。首先，欧洲经济整体面临着拖欠款项和长期付款期限的挑战，引起了行政和财务负担，可能会导致影响企业增长的争端。在整个欧盟范围内，建筑业似乎最受拖欠款项的影响[[16](#CR16)]。付款行为的差异破坏了行业的正常运转，并越来越威胁着中小企业的生存[[16](#CR16),
    [17](#CR17)]。毫无疑问，建筑行业的性质导致了不公平的付款期限和延迟次数上升。特别是，拖欠款项的原因通常直接与建筑公司以及有时是与顾问合作的政府部门的行为有关。面对这种情况，拖欠款项受到了决策者和私营部门协会的日益关注。而对意大利建筑行业的聚焦，一项针对该国情况的分析揭示了公共机构在行业中倾向于拖欠款项的平均付款期限较长，从而影响了顾问和公司的流动性。2017年，几乎70%的公司表示公共管理部门拖欠款项[[18](#CR18),
    [19](#CR19)]。支付延迟伴随着第二个主要问题，即建筑过程中的延迟交付。特别是，意大利的“公共工程实施时间报告”[[15](#CR15)]强调了完成流程阶段（设计、采购、建设和维护）所需的时间周期长。具体来说，报告突出了“等待时间”的影响，即一个阶段结束和下一个阶段开始之间的时间间隔在每个阶段的总持续时间中所占的比例。该报告指出，设计阶段的整体持续时间受到验证和验证程序、授权和官僚程序在等待时间期间的影响[[15](#CR15)]。
- en: This analysis confirms the valuable scope of experimentation of the research
    in the design phase. Regarding what stated so far, the research question that
    triggered the development of the framework of the research is about how the digital
    methodologies and tools could affect the reduction of late deliveries and overdue
    payments in the design phase. The proposed research framework provides a theoretical
    response to the above-mentioned question. It illustrates a process that, if concretely
    carried out, permits the distancing from the traditional practices ensuring the
    shortening of the process development and the satisfaction of the contracting
    parties. Further developments of the research will experience and demonstrate
    the framework through the implementation of a proof of concept, proving its validity
    and innovation.

- en: As anticipated, the research proposes the integration of the automatic BIM validation
    and smart contracts to automate and shorten the design phase development. The
    suggested framework of the research underlines the potential offered by the information
    management based on these technologies. In particular, the implementation of a
    BIM process based on blockchain could improve the information management thanks
    to the recording of any activity, constant monitoring of the progress, exhaustive
    verification and validation of the information requirements and identification
    of the responsible parties. This combination could give confidence and harmony
    to the information shared, produced, reviewed and stored. The framework could
    correspondingly improve the process execution and management. In the contractual
    environment typical of the construction sector, the opportunity of automating
    certain processes that are traditionally performed by interaction and pursued
    based on decisions promoted by agreement among multiple parties is a valid area
    for experimentation. To support and motivate the development of the framework,
    this section discusses two main topics. At first, the information management using
    BIM is illustrated with a focus on the procedures for the verification and validation
    of the information requirements. Then, the current areas of research on blockchain
    in construction, with a focus on digital information management, as well as the
    potential blockchain network to be adopted in the framework are discussed.

  zh: 2.1 基于BIM的数字信息管理
- en: The progressive digital transformation of information management is driving
    a revolution in the procedures during the overall construction process. In this
    context, both public and private clients are becoming interested in innovative
    practices that exploit information management to improve communication, efficiency,
    safety and productivity of the built environment. The digitalisation is stimulating
    greater automation of the design, tender, construction and maintenance phases,
    optimising the building life cycle and improving the client’s satisfaction and
    end-user’s experience [[20](#CR20)]. In this context, Building Information Modelling
    can be considered the methodology that is driving the digital transformation.
    As an approach based on digital information management, it can indeed be crucial
    for better decision-making, predictability and confidence in obtaining the expected
    results. It significantly influences the system of creating, collecting, using
    and sharing the digital information throughout the asset life cycle, involving
    all the stakeholders. The ISO 19650 series, as international standards that define
    digital information management procedures during the asset life cycle, encourages
    the introduction of BIM and uniformly guides the experts in its use [[21](#CR21)].
    ISO 19650 defines BIM as a beneficial method based on the better specification
    and digital delivery of the right amount of information about design, construction,
    operation and maintenance of an asset using appropriate technologies [[22](#CR22)].
    The information management process covers the activities of defining information
    requirements and the production, delivery and review of information. Within such
    a process, each participant is responsible for certain information management
    functions to be fulfilled. Each party engaged has, therefore, an involvement and
    interaction with information management according to their role and responsibilities.
    Indeed, ISO 19650 undertakes the identification of the main actors in the process,
    denoted as the appointing party, the lead appointed party and the appointed party(s)
    [[22](#CR22)]. The first, usually represented by the client, is the one who defines
    the information requirements. The second is the party responsible for the coordination
    of the exchanged information and the third is the one accountable for the information
    production. According to ISO 19650, to achieve a successful information management
    using BIM, each actor involved must fulfil three main tasks. The first is the
    clear definition of the information requirements, and standards for their production
    and review. The second is the proper production of the quantity and quality of
    the required information, and the third is the efficient and effective exchange
    of information among the involved parties. Specifically, the appointing party
    is the one who starts the process, stating the information requirements and ensuring
    their clear definition. This statement defines the type of information and clarifies
    how different types of information should be structured and exchanged. Then, each
    prospective lead appointed party responds to the information requirements stated,
    through the development of the BIM Execution Plan (BEP), which is considered by
    the appointing party when selecting the lead appointed party. After this stage,
    all the actors collaborate to agree on the key roles and responsibilities and
    arrange an information delivery plan that outlines coordination and delivery schemes.
    This allows the configuration of an appropriate information management, that provides
    and considers the requirements of the involved parties, the delivery process,
    and the use of appropriate technologies. At the end of every project stage, a
    review of the information produced is needed to validate the appropriate achievement
    of the information requirements. This review process is commonly performed through
    a mixture of manual and automated methods and applications.

  zh: 信息管理的渐进数字化转型正在推动整个建设过程的革命。在这一背景下，无论是公共还是私人客户，都对利用信息管理改善建筑环境的沟通、效率、安全和生产力的创新实践产生了兴趣。数字化正在促进设计、投标、建设和维护阶段的更多自动化，优化建筑的生命周期，提高客户的满意度和最终用户的体验[[20](#CR20)]。在这种情况下，建筑信息模型可以被看作是推动数字转型的方法论。作为一种基于数字信息管理的方法，它对于更好的决策、可预测性和对预期结果的信心可能至关重要。它显著影响着贯穿资产生命周期的数字信息的创建、收集、使用和共享的系统，涉及所有利益相关者。作为定义资产生命周期中数字信息管理程序的国际标准，ISO
    19650系列鼓励引入BIM，并统一指导专家们如何使用[[21](#CR21)]。ISO 19650将BIM定义为一种有益的方法，基于对关于设计、施工、运营和维护的正确数量信息的更好规范和数字交付，使用适当的技术[[22](#CR22)]。信息管理过程包括定义信息需求以及信息的生成、交付和审查活动。在这样的过程中，每个参与者都有责任完成特定的信息管理功能。因此，每个参与方根据其角色和责任与信息管理有关。事实上，ISO
    19650确定了过程中的主要参与者，称为指定方、主要委派方和被委派方[[22](#CR22)]。第一方通常由客户代表，负责定义信息需求。第二方负责协调交换的信息，第三方负责信息的生产。根据ISO
    19650，为了使用BIM实现成功的信息管理，每个参与方都必须完成三项主要任务。第一项任务是明确定义信息需求以及其生成和审查的标准。第二项任务是适量和合格的所需信息的正确生产。第三项任务是各参与方之间信息的高效交换。具体来说，指定方是启动流程的一方，陈述信息需求并确保对其进行明确定义。这份声明定义了信息的类型，并澄清了不同类型信息应如何构造和交换。然后，每个潜在的主要委派方通过编制BIM执行计划（BEP）来回应阐明的信息需求，在选择主要委派方时指定方会考虑这一计划。在这个阶段之后，所有参与方合作，以协商关键角色和责任，并制定一个信息交付计划，概述协调和交付方案。这使合适的信息管理得以配置，并考虑了参与方的要求、交付过程和使用适当的技术。在每个项目阶段结束时，需要审查所生成的信息，以验证信息需求的适当达成。这一审查过程通常通过手动和自动化的方法和应用来进行。
- en: 'The aforementioned definition of the information requirements is based on structured
    information management, allowing the explicit definition of the requirements,
    their availability to the different parties and the continuous review of their
    fulfilment [[23](#CR23)]. Each information produced must be reviewed to double-check
    the compliance with the information requirements and, consequently, accepted (or
    rejected). In this context, the ISO 19650 series [[22](#CR22)] outlines the client
    as the person in charge of defining the project objectives and information requirements
    and reviewing the information delivered for each phase of the asset life cycle.
    However, since ISO 19650 does not provide the organisation or project-specific
    details and considers the high level of client’s involvement, starting from the
    general standards recommended, the need of BIM guidelines containing the personalised
    client’s requirements has become progressively evident. The customisation of the
    standards allows the client to create proprietary BIM guidelines for the identification
    of the information requirements in a structured way and the regulation of subsequent
    procedures based on the specific needs. The customisation of procedures for organising
    the client’s needs boosts BIM to be integrated into the construction industry
    in a controlled and gradual manner. In particular, to guide large clients in the
    preparation of effective BIM guidelines [[20](#CR20)], ISO/TS 12911 supports the
    definition of personalised methods for information management [[24](#CR24)]. Indeed,
    ISO/TS 12911 provides a structured and reusable framework to guide the BIM process
    development [[24](#CR24)]. The suggested framework allows the creation of a common
    structure for the application of BIM and makes BIM guidelines manageable and testable.
    BIM guidelines are prepared and used for: (i) defining the desired information
    outputs and their expected quality, (ii) customising the structured implementation
    of project information, (iii) identifying the resources and tools and their appropriate
    management, (iv) obtaining and maintaining a common knowledge within the project
    and (v) supporting the technologies behind BIM. The preparation of proprietary
    BIM guidelines, before the start of the design phase, allows the client to develop
    the information requirements in a structured way and it is fundamental to ensure
    the contracting parties have a clear definition of all the types of information
    to be produced and managed [[25](#CR25)]. Since proprietary BIM guidelines are
    drafted by a specific client, they allow the standardisation and guidance of processes
    based on precise needs. For these reasons, the existing proprietary guidelines
    can differ widely from one another, in their goals, approach to standardisation,
    technology requirements and level of information needed [[26](#CR26)]. However,
    they are a powerful tool to promote and guide the adoption of information management
    using BIM. Since the generation of value in the construction industry depends
    on the identification, processing and fulfilment of the client’s requirements,
    the presence of specific guidelines can support the process development and guarantee

    19650系列标准 [[22](#CR22)] 规定客户负责定义项目目标和信息需求，并审查资产生命周期各阶段交付的信息。然而，由于ISO 19650标准未提供组织或项目特定细节，并考虑到客户高度参与，由通用标准出发，逐渐明显起来需要包含个性化客户需求的BIM指南。标准的定制使客户能够以结构化方式创建专有的BIM指南，并根据特定需求规范后续程序。定制客户需求组织程序促进了BIM在建筑行业中受控和逐渐集成。特别是，为了指导大型客户制定有效的BIM指南
    [[20](#CR20)]，ISO/TS 12911支持为信息管理定义个性化方法 [[24](#CR24)]。的确，ISO/TS 12911提供了一个结构化和可复用的框架，可以指导BIM过程的发展
    [[24](#CR24)]。建议的框架允许创建BIM应用的共同结构，并使BIM指南可管理和可测试。BIM指南的准备和使用用于：(i) 定义期望的信息输出及其预期质量，(ii)
    定制项目信息的结构化实施，(iii) 确定资源和工具以及其适当的管理，(iv) 在项目内获取和维护共享知识，(v) 支持BIM背后的技术。在设计阶段开始之前，专属BIM指南的准备使客户能够以结构化方式制定信息需求，这对确保合同各方明确了所有需生产和管理的信息类型是至关重要的
    [[25](#CR25)]。由于专有BIM指南由特定的客户起草，它们允许根据精确需求标准化和指导流程。因此，现有的专有指南可能在目标、标准化方法、技术要求和所需信息水平等方面存在着很大差异
    [[26](#CR26)]。但是，它们是推动和指导使用BIM进行信息管理的强有力工具。由于建筑行业中的价值生成取决于客户需求的识别、处理和实现，具体指南的存在可以支持过程的发展并保证实现需求。BIM指南对BIM环境中的结构化信息请求、生产、审查和管理进行规范化，促进了不同参与者之间的一致信息，增强了透明和协作的工作流程，并减少了信息不对称或需求误解的发生。

  zh: 2.2 基于区块链的数字信息管理
- en: Due to its growing interest, the introduction of blockchain technology has promoted
    new types of applications, and therefore it could be considered the main technology
    qualifying the digital transformation currently studied by the most advanced world
    economies [[27](#CR27), [28](#CR28)]. Belonging to the Distributed Ledger Technologies
    (DLTs), blockchain is defined as a *trustless* technology, that ensures an extraordinary
    degree of trustworthiness, integrity and immutability [[29](#CR29)] and that allows
    parties to send transactions using a peer-to-peer network, without the control
    of a trusted third party (TTP) [[30](#CR30), [31](#CR31)]. The creation and maintenance
    of trust are guaranteed by the design of the technology. The level of transparency,
    accessibility and traceability of information shared and stored using the technology
    is defined by its architecture design. Among DLTs, blockchain offers unique features,
    including a considerable number of use cases and the possibility to implement
    smart contracts. As previously stated, smart contracts will be an important topic
    of investigation and application in the presented research. Undeniably, according
    to some researchers, late payments in the construction industry led to several
    claims, but the adoption of smart contracts could significantly reduce the actual
    negative concerns [[32](#CR32)–[34](#CR34)]. The selection and configuration of
    the suitable blockchain network make it possible to draw up and execute smart
    contracts. Although smart contracts are automatic and deterministic, they are
    not perfectly *trustless*. Since blockchain cannot access data outside its network
    on its own, the main limitation with smart contracts is the communication with
    the real world. For these reasons, it is necessary to integrate a third-party
    system that allows access and verification of what is happening in the real world
    and sends the information to the blockchain via smart contracts. Such services
    are defined as oracles [[35](#CR35)]. In this way, the entire network can validate
    the request, and the contract is able to accept or reject it automatically. When
    the conditions comply with the planned process, smart contracts automatically
    execute, approving the release or directly issuing the payment [[36](#CR36)].
    The use of such services is of great importance to the framework of the research,
    since they can guarantee the connection of the external world, i.e. the information
    production and validation during the design phase, and the blockchain world, i.e.
    the recording of information and the automatic approval of the process stages.

    [28](#CR28)]。属于分布式账本技术（DLTs）的区块链被定义为一种*无需信任*的技术，它确保了非常高的可信度、完整性和不可变性[[29](#CR29)]，并且允许各方使用点对点网络发送交易，无需受到可信第三方（TTP）的控制[[30](#CR30),
    [31](#CR31)]。技术的设计保证了信任的建立和维护。使用该技术共享和存储信息的透明度、可访问性和可追溯性水平由其架构设计所定义。在DLTs中，区块链提供了独特的功能，包括大量的用例和实施智能合约的可能性。如前所述，智能合约将是本研究的重要研究和应用主题。毫无疑问，根据一些研究人员认为，建筑行业的迟付款导致了多起索赔，但智能合约的采用可以显著减少实际的负面影响[[32](#CR32)–[34](#CR34)]。选择和配置适当的区块链网络使得制定和执行智能合约成为可能。尽管智能合约是自动和确定性的，但它们并非完全*无需信任*。由于区块链无法自行访问其网络之外的数据，智能合约的主要限制是与现实世界的通信。因此，有必要整合第三方系统，允许访问和验证现实世界中发生的情况，并通过智能合约将信息发送到区块链。这样的服务被定义为预言机[[35](#CR35)]。通过这种方式，整个网络可以验证请求，合约能够自动接受或拒绝。当条件符合计划的流程时，智能合约会自动执行，批准释放或直接发放支付[[36](#CR36)]。这些服务的使用对于研究框架非常重要，因为它们可以保证外部世界与区块链世界的连接，即设计阶段的信息生产和验证以及流程阶段的自动批准的记录。

    and immutability of information, which make it possible to limit the occurrence
    of misunderstandings, and the automation of the process, which guarantees the
    disbursement of payments and respect of the deliveries, the proposed research
    is placed among other emerging studies and experimentations related to the integration
    of the information management based on BIM and blockchain in the design phase.
    Indeed, the possibility to develop and maintain the information inside the BIM
    models using blockchain allows the recording of any activity, therefore controlling
    at any time the real progress of the considered phase and the responsible parties.
    The integration of blockchain in the BIM process gives confidence and synchronization
    to the information shared, produced, reviewed and stored. The information is stored
    on a distributed platform shared among all the participants, which allows the
    notarisation of each piece of information created, modified and updated as the
    process progresses. In this way, the progress of the process and the monitoring
    of the compliance with project objectives are known by both the client and all
    the involved appointed parties. In the existing literature, it is possible to
    recognise some different studies related to the adoption of blockchain in digital
    information management during the design phase. Dounas et al. proposed a framework
    for decentralised architectural design that allows multiple participants to solve
    the design problems in both collaborative and competitive ways and, thanks to
    the integration of blockchain, it is able to record all the design attempts, including
    the ones that have ‘failed’, and all the positive steps towards design optimisation
    [[12](#CR12)]. Schönhals et al. proposed an approach that makes it possible to
    protect developed ideas and early concepts even during their systematic development.
    It intends to protect the intellectual property through the digital record of
    verbal, written or sketched, and even modelled or constructed outcomes during
    the innovation development in real-time [[37](#CR37)]. Another work to be cited
    is from Zheng et al. that proposed an application for mobile devices that allowed
    users to check on their portable devices whether a BIM model is the latest version,
    whereby, a hash of the BIM model is stored on the blockchain that allows a search
    service to cross-check the hash of a downloaded model with the hash stored on
    the chain, after which, the application will provide users with a verification
    receipt that declares the validity of the model [[38](#CR38)].

    progressed towards the creation of private and permissioned networks. In these
    networks, participation is permissioned. Participants have restrictions on writing
    rights (data validation) or/and reading rights (access to data). As the public
    networks, permissioned ones are immutable and nodes share the same ledger, but
    the access to the network is permissioned, this means that the role of each node

- en: 'As specified in Sect. [3](#Sec5), the framework of the research focuses on
    the design phase where a specific client appoints a design team to produce and
    manage information related to a specific project in compliance with BIM guidelines.
    For these reasons, the architecture of the blockchain network must be the response
    and balance the requirements of both the client and the contracting parties involved.
    Therefore, evaluating the structured environment in which the design process is
    implemented, the initial theoretical investigations of blockchain networks concern
    the permissioned ones. In order to set up a permissioned blockchain to support
    the research framework implementation, among the existing private networks [[40](#CR40)],
    Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) has been analysed and selected as the potential most
    suitable network to be configured and integrated in the framework of the research
    (see Sect. [4](#Sec6)). HLF, which is the most popular permissioned network, is
    well adjustable to a wide range of distributed applications written in general
    programming languages. For these reasons, companies that create and deploy blockchain
    applications within their businesses use it. The network consists of various peers
    that host blockchain, execute smart contracts and mutually maintain the state
    of the ledger. Smart contracts in HLF are called *chaincodes*, they can be shared
    by all entities within a company, or they can be shared privately and accessed
    by a specific group of entities [[40](#CR40)]. Smart contracts are executed only
    on nodes with which the network is shared, thus being inaccessible to others.
    The possibility of selecting specific nodes is guaranteed by the channel concept:
    information and smart contracts present in a specific channel are only accessible
    to the channel participants. In the network setup phase, the participating nodes
    are identified and authenticated, hence it is possible to identify if a certain
    node belongs to a certain channel. Currently, HLF supports Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM) bytecode smart contracts, allowing the contracts to be written and managed
    with the same tools of Ethereum, thus simplifying the configuration procedures.
    Based on the investigation of the existing literature [[39](#CR39), [40](#CR40)],
    Hyperledger Fabric is shown to be the network that performs better in terms of
    performance, architecture, and components, therefore it is the one identified
    to be potentially set up and tested in the framework of the research. Thanks to
    permissions, network participants are known and acknowledged when setting up and
    running the network. The adoption of blockchain technology in the development
    of the research will allow the creation of a network through which selected participants
    can share information transparently and perform transactions securely.'

  zh: 如在第 [3](#Sec5) 节中指定的那样，研究框架侧重于设计阶段，特定的客户委托设计团队根据BIM准则产生和管理与特定项目相关的信息。基于这些原因，区块链网络的架构必须是客户和涉及的合同方的需求的回应和平衡。因此，在评估设计过程实施的结构化环境时，区块链网络的起初理论调查涉及许可的网络。为了建立一个支持研究框架实施的许可区块链，Hyperledger
    Fabric（HLF）已经被分析和选定为可能最适合配置和集成在研究框架中的网络（参见第 [4](#Sec6) 节）。HLF是最流行的许可网络，非常适应于一系列使用通用编程语言编写的分布式应用程序。因此，那些在业务中创建和部署区块链应用程序的公司使用它。网络由承载区块链、执行智能合约并相互维护账本状态的各种节点组成。在HLF中，智能合约被称为*链码*，它们可以被公司内所有实体共享，也可以被私下共享并由特定组的实体访问。HLF中的智能合约仅在网络共享的节点上执行，因此对其他人不可访问。通过渠道概念，选择特定节点的可能性是有保障的：在特定渠道中存在的信息和智能合约仅对渠道参与者可访问。在网络设置阶段，参与节点得到识别和认证，因此可以确定某个节点是否属于某个渠道。目前，HLF支持以太坊虚拟机（EVM）字节码智能合约，允许使用与以太坊相同的工具编写和管理合约，从而简化配置过程。根据现有文献的调查，Hyperledger
    Fabric在性能、架构和组件方面表现更好，因此被确定为潜在可在研究框架中设置并测试的网络。通过权限，当设置和运行网络时，网络参与者是已知且被承认的。在发展研究中采用区块链技术将允许创建一个网络，通过该网络，选定的参与者可以透明共享信息并安全进行交易。

    the proprietary BIM guidelines. These guidelines are transmitted to the design
    team during the appointment process. Once the appointment has been awarded, the
    design team develops the project based on proprietary BIM guidelines content.
    The team produces all the information included in BIM models following the defined
    information requirements. In this way, the produced information will respond entirely
    to the requirements set out by the client, and therefore the design will be realised
    in a compliant and optimised way. Simultaneously with the development of the information
    models, the verifier, appointed by the client, also receives the proprietary BIM
    guidelines. The verifier is a consultant of the client that undertakes the detailed
    analysis of the guidelines to translate the information requirements from semantic
    language to machine-readable language through the configuration of adequate tools.
    Since the creation and management of a BIM project requires the production of
    a large amount of digital information, manual verifications are difficult to be
    performed objectively and exhaustively. For these reasons, to ensure that the
    information requirements are completely met, the verifier identifies a suitable
    application to develop automatic rulesets compliant with the content of the guidelines.
    Such a tool, which can be implemented in the modelling software, is capable of
    automatically and completely validating the information content produced according
    to the client’s requirements (see Sect. [4](#Sec6)). Once the production of information
    is completed, the design team delivers the BIM models produced for each project
    discipline (i. e. architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical) to the
    client. The delivered models are uniquely stored in the CDE solution, considered
    the off-chain database. The files stored in the CDE are also stored and linked
    with a blockchain network, using a distributed storage system, to keep track of
    the model delivery cycle. Due to the large size of the models, the system creates
    for each delivered BIM model a cryptographic hash that is stored in the blockchain
    network through smart contracts. The hash added to the blockchain network enables
    the inspection of the mapped BIM model that is stored on the computer memory of
    the peer with the same name as the hash. This makes it possible to control access
    and changes to the BIM models in a uniform and secure way. When a new model is
    delivered, its hash and the hash of the already stored models are compared. This
    makes it possible to check transparently both that the same model has been delivered
    twice and that the model, claimed to have been revised after validation procedures,
    has not been modified.

  zh: 为展示研究的业务逻辑、各方互动的动态以及创新技术工具的使用，下面逐步解释了框架应用的一个示例。致力于在设计阶段执行过程中验证客户的信息需求，驱动力是专有的BIM指南内容，所述过程基于ISO
    19650系列推荐的信息管理结构化程序。正如先前所述，参与信息生产和管理过程的各方具有具体的责任和任务。在研究案例中，参与的各方是客户、设计团队和验证者（图[1](#Fig1)）。作为项目的所有者或项目承办方，客户必须进行一切活动，以确保满足准确的信息管理。因此，客户定义项目信息需求、信息生产协议、交付里程碑，并设置支持模型和信息在各方之间进行生产、共享和存档的共同数据环境（CDE）解决方案。符合ISO
    19650系列和ISO/TS 12911的规定，客户已经在专有的BIM指南中个性化并设置了所需的信息需求、协议和里程碑。这些指南在任命过程中传达给了设计团队。一旦项目被承接，设计团队就会根据专有的BIM指南内容开发项目。团队根据定义的信息需求制作所有包含在BIM模型中的信息。这样，产生的信息将完全符合客户设定的需求，因此设计将以合规和优化的方式实现。与信息模型的开发同时进行，客户任命的验证者也接收到了专有的BIM指南。验证者是客户的顾问，负责详细分析指南，通过配置适当的工具将信息需求从语义语言翻译为机器可读语言。由于BIM项目的创建和管理需要大量数字信息的生产，手动验证难以客观和全面地进行。因此，为了确保信息需求得到完全满足，验证者确定了适用的应用程序，开发符合指南内容的自动规则集。这样的工具可以被实施在建模软件中，能够自动和完全验证根据客户需求生产的信息内容（见第[4](#Sec6)节）。信息生产完成后，设计团队将为每个项目学科（例如建筑、结构、机械和电气）制作的BIM模型交付给客户。交付的模型唯一存储在CDE解决方案中，被视为链下数据库。CDE中存储的文件也与区块链网络进行存储和关联，使用分布式存储系统，以跟踪模型交付周期。由于模型的尺寸很大，系统为每个交付的BIM模型创建一个加密哈希，通过智能合约将其存储到区块链网络中。哈希添加到区块链网络中，能够检查存储在具有相同名称的对等方计算机内存上的映射BIM模型。这样可以以一种统一且安全的方式控制对BIM模型的访问和更改。当交付新模型时，将比较其哈希和已存储模型的哈希。这样可以透明地检查同一模型是否被重复交付，以及在验证过程之后宣称已经进行了修订的模型是否被修改。
- en: Following the delivery procedure, the verifier uses the programmed application
    to automatically verify and validate the information included in the BIM models.
    For each model verified, the application independently produces a report containing
    the results of the verification. The created reports are stored in the CDE and,
    likely for the models, their hashes are recorded on the blockchain network hence
    the progress of the modelling process could be recorded and mapped transparently.
    In this environment, project verification and validation activities are managed
    evidently, improving the communication between the client and the design team.
    The automatic validation of the information speeds up and optimises the review
    and delivery process. The archiving of results allows the client to assess the
    compliance with the information requirements. This framework also ensures the
    absence of non-conformities and disputes during the phase progress. The outcome
    of the report reveals the compliance of the information produced with the client’s
    requirements and the timing of the delivery. The level of compliance for which
    the delivered models are approved is defined at the beginning by the client and
    communicated to the design team at the time of the appointment. The automatic
    validation of information included in the models takes place separately for each
    discipline, so four separate reports are created for each verification cycle.

  zh: 在交付过程后，验证人员使用预先编程的应用程序自动验证和验证BIM模型中包含的信息。对于每个验证的模型，应用程序独立生成包含验证结果的报告。生成的报告存储在CDE中，并且模型的哈希值可能被记录在区块链网络上，因此可以透明地记录和映射建模过程的进展。在这种环境下，项目验证和验证活动得到明显管理，改善了客户和设计团队之间的沟通。信息的自动验证加快和优化了审查和交付过程。结果的归档使客户能够评估信息需求的符合性。该框架还确保了在阶段进展期间不存在不符合和争议。报告的结果显示了生产的信息与客户要求和交付的时机的符合性。交付的模型被批准的符合水平在开始时由客户定义，并在约定时通知设计团队。模型中包含的信息的自动验证分别针对每个学科进行，因此每个验证周期会创建四个独立的报告。
- en: If the automatic verification of information models produces a report with a
    result that is below the set level of compliance, the design team receives the
    report containing all the detected non-conformities and it must proceed with the
    changes and indicated corrections. The design team must then subsequently make
    a new delivery. If, on the other hand, the set level of compliance is met, i.e.
    information produced has met the client’s information requirements, the model
    is accepted and stored in the CDE, for the future steps towards construction and/or
    building operation and maintenance. Therefore, the automatic validation process,
    connected to a blockchain network, is combined with the automation of contractual
    performance through the adoption of a smart contract between the client and the
    design team. Since blockchain cannot retrieve directly external information, an
    oracle is required to create the connection between the smart contract and the
    off-chain data source. At the time of the appointment, the client and the design
    team have established the terms and conditions of payment approval upon the completion
    of the assigned tasks. These conditions impose the authorisation for the release
    of payment when the delivered models’ verification lines up to the set level of
    compliance. To automate this approval process and link it directly to the results
    of the model verification, the payment conditions are translated into a smart
    contract. Therefore, a back-end oracle ensures the connection between the verification
    report’s result and blockchain to transmit and store the result in an oracle smart
    contract. The data stored in the oracle smart contract can be retrieved by the
    smart contract for payment that compares whether the level of compliance achieved
    is equal to or greater than the established level and, if so, initiates the transaction.
    The smart contract for payment is linked with an escrow account, that holds and
    only disburses funds when the task is completed as expected, ensuring the payment
    release to the design team.

  zh: 如果信息模型的自动验证生成的报告结果低于设定的合规水平，设计团队将收到报告，其中包含所有检测到的不符合情况，并必须进行更改和指示的修正。然后设计团队必须随后进行新的交付。另一方面，如果达到了设定的合规水平，即生成的信息满足客户的信息需求，模型将被接受并存储在CDE中，以便进行未来的建筑和/或建筑运营和维护。因此，与区块链网络连接的自动验证过程结合了通过采用客户与设计团队之间的智能合同自动执行合同性能。由于区块链不能直接检索外部信息，因此需要使用Oracle创建智能合同和链下数据源之间的连接。在任命时，客户和设计团队已经建立了任务完成后付款批准的条款和条件。这些条件决定了在交付模型的验证达到设定的合规水平时才授权释放付款。为了自动化此批准过程并直接与模型验证结果关联，付款条件被转化为智能合同。因此，后端Oracle确保了验证报告结果与区块链之间的连接，以传输和存储结果在Oracle智能合同中。存储在Oracle智能合同中的数据可以通过用于付款的智能合同检索，比较达到的合规水平是否等于或大于设定的水平，如果是，则启动交易。付款的智能合同与托管账户相连，只有在任务按预期完成时才持有和发放资金，确保向设计团队释放付款。
- en: The pursued business logic makes the coded payment conditions self-execute at
    the end of each verification cycle of the information model, if the level of compliance
    is equal to or higher than the one set by the client. Indeed, in each model verification
    cycle, the application operation reports the type of model verified, the time
    of verification and the level of compliance reached and automatically compares
    it with the set level agreed upon between the parties. This process incentivises
    the participants to perform their assigned tasks as stated under the contract.
    Information produced and included in the BIM models is developed by observing
    the client’s requirements and the design team is approved for payments through
    a smart contract for each completed delivery step. Therefore, the design cycle,
    and the subsequent validation, is an iterative process. Design information models
    are only approved when they meet the information requirements contained in the
    proprietary BIM guidelines. Only when the outcome of the report equals or exceeds
    the defined threshold of the level of compliance allowing the verification flag,
    the model is archived and the payment for the activity is automatically approved.

- en: Information production, review, validation and management underlying the research
    framework are accomplished with the agreement of the information requirements
    made clear by the client in the proprietary BIM guidelines. As stated above, the
    scope of the research is limited to the design phase, where a client plays the
    role of the appointing party, requiring the production and management of digital
    information in accordance with its BIM guidelines. The proposed framework of the
    research is developed to test its operation, validity and innovation tangibly
    on a project briefly presented in Sect. [3](#Sec5), considered as the proof of
    concept of the research. For these reasons the software requested by the client
    and used by the design team for the realisation of the models in the design phase
    is known and it is the Autodesk Revit authoring tool. Consequently, the application
    identified to perform the automatic validation of the digital information must
    be able to communicate with that modelling software. Among the Revit applications
    that permit the performance of personalised checks on BIM models, Autodesk Model
    Checker for Revit has been chosen as it allows the creation of customisable verification
    and validation rulesets for data and naming conventions checks. The progressive
    digitisation of information during the project development has caused a significant
    increase in its quantity and complexity. BIM models can be defined as repositories
    of all project information that must comply with the information requirements
    expressed by the client [[22](#CR22), [24](#CR24)]. Indeed, according to the international
    standards, information produced and managed during the project development must
    be verified at the end of each planned phase of the process. In the context of
    the research, the review and validation of information produced and included in
    the BIM models, therefore, becomes a fundamental activity to achieve the compliance
    with the guidelines content.

  zh: 信息制作、审核、验证和管理是研究框架的基础，必须在专有的BIM指南中明确的信息要求得到客户的同意后才能完成。如上所述，研究范围仅限于设计阶段，客户在其中扮演委托方的角色，要求根据其BIM指南生产和管理数字信息。研究的提出框架旨在测试其在第[3](#Sec5)节简要介绍的项目中的操作、有效性和创新性，被视为研究的概念验证。因此，由客户要求并由设计团队用于设计阶段模型实现的软件是已知的且为Autodesk
    Revit撰写工具。因此，用于执行数字信息的自动验证的应用必须能够与该建模软件进行通信。在Revit应用程序中，允许对BIM模型进行个性化检查的应用程序中，Autodesk
    Model Checker for Revit已经被选择，因为它允许创建可定制的验证规则集用于数据和命名约定检查。在项目开发过程中信息的逐步数字化使其数量和复杂性显著增加。BIM模型可以被定义为必须符合客户要求的项目所有信息的储存库[[22](#CR22),
    [24](#CR24)]。事实上，根据国际标准，在项目开发期间生产和管理的信息必须在过程的每个计划阶段结束时进行验证。在该研究背景下，因此，对BIM模型中包含的信息进行审查和验证成为实现指南内容合规的基本活动。
- en: The setting up of an application for the automatic information validation becomes
    crucial as frequently the verification of the BIM models is manually implemented.
    This activity is time-consuming and error-prone, with the plausible generation
    of disputes and discontent in the subsequent phases. Since these operations for
    verification demonstrate to be critical, the creation of an automated BIM validation
    process is vital in the digital information management. To start solving these
    issues, the first objective of the research is the description of the tool-operating
    framework for the information validation. Aiming at giving greater reliability
    and integrity to the information review process, the overall approach defined
    to validate the activities of the BIM models is illustrated in Fig. [2](#Fig2).
    The approach is implemented starting from the analysis and interpretation of the
    proprietary BIM guidelines. The client uses a semantic language to define the
    information requirements for the design and, to integrate them in an application
    for automatic validation, they must be translated into a machine-readable language
    that can be interpreted by the chosen software (i.e. Autodesk Model Checker Configurator).
    The mediation between the two languages takes place through a domain-oriented
    language, whose terms allow a simple and immediate definition of the domain in
    which professionals operate. The identified application does not modify the information
    model to be analysed, however based on rulesets, it reports any error messages
    if the model presents inconsistencies with respect to the domain. The rulesets
    consist of the translation of the guidelines information requirements and represent
    the verification domain.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png)

    Model Checker Configurator）解释的机器可读语言。这两种语言之间的中介是通过一个面向领域的语言实现的，其术语允许专业人员在其中操作的领域进行简单和直接的定义。确定的应用程序不会修改要分析的信息模型，但是基于规则集，如果模型与领域不一致，则会报告任何错误信息。规则集包括将指南信息需求翻译为验证领域，并代表验证领域的验证。![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png)

- en: 'Therefore, the functioning logic of the automatic verification is based on
    the creation of a validation domain (i.e. the content of the guidelines) used
    as a reference to verify that the model falls within this domain. The rulesets
    implementation in the BIM models generates the result “approved” or “rejected”
    for each verified requirement. The rulesets are in fact implemented and executed
    in each BIM model (i.e. architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical),
    concluding an exhaustive verification cycle. The activity ends with the production,
    for each BIM model, of a report containing the results of the verification. The
    reports contain all errors and inconsistencies between information contained in
    the models and the information requirements contained in the proprietary BIM guidelines.
    The approach for the setup of the automatic information validation process starts
    with the identification of the content of the proprietary BIM guidelines to be
    translated and included in the application and with the definition of the general
    organisation to be respected for the setup of each ruleset. Since the amount of
    information is increased due to the digital transformation of the construction
    process, the information requirements established by the client are abundant.
    In particular, the content of the proprietary BIM guidelines of the selected project
    can be divided into three macro-categories of information requirements to be verified:
    (i) BIM objects naming conventions, (ii) BIM model templates naming conventions
    and (iii) BIM object parameters. In the first category are defined, for each discipline
    (i.e. architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical), the naming conventions
    of the BIM model, the designations of loadable families, system families and their
    types, the designations of sheets and materials. In the second category, for each
    discipline, the naming conventions of the levels, views (drawings, fronts, and
    sections), schedules and grids are defined. Finally, the third category defines
    the association of the parameters with each object and their value. Evaluated
    the significant content of the proprietary BIM guidelines, the work related to
    the interpretation and translation of the information requirements using the Autodesk
    Model Checker for Revit application is undoubtedly onerous. The operating framework
    of the application has to involve the two macro-categories of rulesets identified
    for each discipline, namely one related to all naming conventions rules and the
    other related to rules for parameters. Through the support of the chosen application,
    these two macro rulesets are translated from semantic language to machine-readable
    language to be implemented in the BIM models.'

  zh: 因此，自动验证的功能逻辑是基于创建验证域（即指南的内容），该域用作参考来验证模型是否落在该域内。BIM 模型中规则集的实施生成了每个验证要求的“已通过”或“已拒绝”的结果。实际上，规则集是在每个
    BIM 模型（即建筑、结构、机械和电气）中实施并执行，从而完成全面的验证循环。活动最后的结果是为每个 BIM 模型生成一个报告，其中包含验证结果。这些报告包含了模型中所含信息与专有
    BIM 指南中信息要求之间的所有错误和不一致之处。设置自动信息验证流程的方法始于识别需要翻译并纳入应用程序的专有 BIM 指南内容，以及制定需要遵守的每个规则集的一般组织架构的定义。由于建筑工艺的数字转型使信息数量增加，客户建立的信息要求相当多。特别是所选项目的专有
    BIM 指南的内容可以分为三大类需要验证的信息要求：(i) BIM 对象命名约定，(ii) BIM 模型模板命名约定和(iii) BIM 对象参数。在第一类别中，针对每个专业（即建筑、结构、机械和电气），定义了
    BIM 模型的命名约定，可加载家族、系统家族及其类型的名称，以及图纸和材料的命名约定。在第二类别中，针对每个专业，定义了关卡、视图（图纸、立面和剖面）、时间表和网格的命名约定。最后，第三类别定义了与每个对象的参数及其值的关联。针对专有
    BIM 指南的重要内容进行评估后，使用 Autodesk Model Checker for Revit 应用程序进行信息要求的解释和翻译的工作无疑是繁重的。该应用程序的操作框架必须涉及为每个专业确定的两大类规则集，即与所有命名约定有关的规则和与参数有关的规则。通过选择的应用程序的支持，这两个宏观规则集从语义语言翻译成机器可读语言，以在
    BIM 模型中实施。
- en: In this way, each rule to be included in the larger ruleset founding the verification
    domain is created. Each verification ruleset is then implemented in the model,
    and at the end of the performance of the application, the verification report,
    containing the errors detected, is automatically obtained. In order to display
    a tangible example, Fig. [3](#Fig3) shows the implementation and verification
    of a rule within a structural BIM model developed in accordance with the proprietary
    BIM guidelines to test the automatic verification tool. The implemented rule intends
    to verify the naming conventions of the structural wall types and, at the end
    of the performance, the verification report is obtained. The report is detailed
    for each identified element. In this case, two types of structural wall, compared
    to those included in the structural BIM model, are detected with different names
    from the guidelines. The percentage of compliance between the naming conventions
    applied for the wall types used in the structural model and the naming conventions
    defined in the client’s requirements, according to the application report is 82%.
    As this illustration intends to show, as an example, only the verification of
    the naming convention of the structural wall types, the 82% obtained represents
    the level of compliance of the model related to a single information requirement,
    and not to the overall content of the BIM guidelines. Figure [3](#Fig3) illustrates
    that for each rejected element the report shows the ID, thus facilitating its
    rapid identification in the model and appropriate correction. Through the brief
    illustration of the architecture setup of the chosen application, it is possible
    to understand that, once the logical process has been defined, the exhaustive
    realisation of the rulesets in the application initially requires time to be invested
    in its creation and definition nevertheless it saves a lot of time in the future

- en: As illustrated for the automatic validation of information included in the BIM
    models, the second main objective of the research framework is the definition
    of the architecture of the potential blockchain network selected. Section [2.2](#Sec4)
    indicates Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) as the potential blockchain network to be evaluated.
    As previously declared, the research project is contextualised in a proprietary
    environment. For this reason, the identification and the future use of a network
    that stands out for identity management, privacy and efficient processing are
    shown to be appropriate. From a technological point of view, the key features
    of HLF architecture include (i) identity management, (ii) channels, (iii) ledger,
    (iv) consensus mechanism, (v) smart contracts and (vi) policies. Unlike *permissionless*
    networks, where unknown identities participate in the network, HLF enrols members
    via the assignment of a digital identity certificate, that manages user IDs and
    enables the authentication of all the network participants, creating an access
    control list [[41](#CR41)]. In this way, privacy becomes a key requirement for
    the functioning of the network in which parties, known to each other, exchange
    sensitive and confidential information. By creating channels, participants can
    form groups to create different transaction ledgers. The channel enables the exchange
    of information (transactions) to a set of peers (participants), pursuant to the
    agreed policies. The creation of private channels enables any groups that require
    confidential transactions to coexist on the same permissioned network. As a blockchain
    network, the HLF ledger is immutable, and it encodes the history and current state
    of transactions in each channel. There is one ledger for each channel and each
    peer keeps a copy of the ledger for each channel in which it is a member. In HLF
    the consensus mechanism is chosen by the network to identify the one that best
    represents the type of relationships existing among the participants. The consensus
    mechanism allows the network to verify the correctness of transactions included
    in a block. The consensus is achieved when the order and result of the transactions
    in a block satisfy the policies of the network. The use of endorsement policies
    is what differentiates HLF from other blockchains. In fact, HLF models the actual
    world more realistically, so transactions must be validated by trusted parties
    of the network. The endorsement policies are associated with each *chaincode*
    that, in HLF, represents smart contracts (see Sect. [2.2](#Sec4)). Each smart
    contract allows the encoding of the logic with which a certain type of transaction
    is invoked on the channel. Other policies exist, e.g. relating to who can query
    or update the ledger, or who can add or remove participants. Finally, HLF can
    manage assets that represent tangible or non-tangible values through which almost
    anything with monetary value is exchanged on the network.

  zh: 正如所示，用于自动验证BIM模型中包含的信息的第二个主要目标是研究框架的架构定义所选择的潜在区块链网络。第 [2.2](#Sec4) 节表明潜在的要评估的区块链网络是超级账本Fabric（HLF）。正如先前宣布的，研究项目是在专有环境中应用的。因此，标识和未来使用以身份管理、隐私和高效处理著称的网络在这一研究中显得是适当的。从技术角度看，HLF架构的关键特性包括（i）身份管理，（ii）通道，（iii）账本，（iv）共识机制，（v）智能合约和（vi）政策。不同于*无许可*网络，HLF通过分配数字身份证书登记成员，管理用户ID并实现对所有网络参与者的认证，以创建访问控制列表[[41](#CR41)]。如此一来，隐私成为网络运作的关键要求，在这个网络中，相互认识的各方交换敏感和机密信息。通过创建通道，参与者可以组成不同的交易分类账。通道使信息（交易）根据约定的政策交换给一组对等体（参与者）。创建私有通道使需要机密交易的任何群体可以在同一有许可的网络上共存。作为一个区块链网络，HLF的记账是不可变的，并且它把每个通道中的交易历史和当前状态都记录下来。每个通道都有一个记账，并且每个对等方都保留着它所属的每个通道的副本。在HLF中，共识机制由网络选择，以确定最能代表参与者之间关系类型的一种。共识机制允许网络验证区块中包含的交易的正确性。当区块中的交易顺序和结果满足网络的政策时，共识就实现了。背书政策是HLF与其他区块链不同的地方。事实上，HLF更真实地模拟实际世界，因此交易必须由网络中的可信方验证。背书政策与在HLF中代表智能合约的每个*链码*相关联（参见第[2.2](#Sec4)节）。每个智能合约都允许对在通道上调用某种类型的交易的逻辑进行编码。还存在其他政策，例如关于谁可以查询或更新分类账，或者谁可以添加或删除参与方的政策。最后，HLF可以通过管理资产来代表有形或无形价值，通过这些资产，网络上几乎可以交换任何具有货币价值的东西。

    here identified and illustrated in the consecutive order of creation (Fig. [4](#Fig4)).
    In particular, the participants are the parties involved in the blockchain network,
    the assets are the values exchanged between the participants and the transactions
    are the logical smart contracts that specify certain events of the process and
    control its development. Thanks to identity management, each participant is identified
    reliably with a name and unique ID. Through the privacy of the network, accesses
    are controlled based on the roles of each participant that, in this environment,
    are known to each other. Each asset is recognised with name, ID and type. Likewise,
    each transaction is defined with a unique ID, name, timestamp and sender. Policies
    and rules based on consensus are defined and checked before each transaction takes

- en: The endorsement policy is established to indicate which participants must sign
    the transactions to declare them valid. Only valid transactions can indeed update
    the state of the ledger. In the research, this policy is mainly entrusted to the
    client who is responsible for validating the transactions. The design team proposes
    the transaction for the BIM models delivery and the verifier proposes the one
    for the verification report produced. The second policy concerns the responsibility
    of updating and querying the ledger. In the research, the design team and verifier
    are the parties primarily responsible for updating and maintaining the data in
    the ledger, while the client can query to retrieve point-in-time data. The identification
    of the elements and logic of the HLF network to be implemented in the research
    allows a complete picture of the integration and operation architecture of the
    technologies involved in the system. Since the scope of the proposed framework
    is the combination of the automatic BIM validation and smart contracts, the architecture
    requires the implementation of oracles. The introduction of an oracle requires
    the creation of a dedicated channel, namely the global channel, in which a network
    participant operates as the trusted person responsible for maintaining and updating
    the ledger with external sources. This channel is provided with an oracle smart
    contract that updates the network and that can be queried for the updated data

- en: The participants, operating in the other channel, can indeed query the ledger
    to consult and obtain certain updated information. As already explained, the process
    starts with the definition of the client’s information requirements through proprietary
    BIM guidelines. Then, the BIM models developed by the design team, based on the
    guidelines, are submitted and automatically verified by the verifier, through
    the use of the setup application. The verification automatically produces a validation
    report containing the level of compliance achieved. The report, containing the
    indication of the model verified, the date of the verification, the failed elements
    and the percentage of compliance, represents the external data source to be connected
    to the blockchain network (i.e. the smart contract protocol) because it is produced
    by a tool external to the network. The verifier, as the supervisor of the verification
    activity, operates in the global channel representing the trusted provider of
    data. The verifier is indeed authorised by rules and policy to invoke the update
    of the ledger with the validation report. The smart contract deployed on the global
    channel, requests the external data and provides an update and a query transaction.
    From the other channel, namely the client-design team channel, the client can
    then invoke the smart contract which, exploiting the cross-channel query capability,
    retrieves the latest updated value. The smart contracts logic is activated, verifying
    that the value of the external source is equal to or greater than the established
    compliance level. If this is the case the logic executes, in compliance with rules
    based on consensus, issuing the approval to release the payment. This means that
    the smart contract logic setup executes the given instructions if some other given
    conditions are met. It could repeatedly verify the condition established (the
    achievement of the set level of compliance) and only perform the planned action
    when the condition has been met (BIM model has reached the set level of compliance).

    and the application of smart contracts, the research framework aims at shortening
    the execution time of the design phase, ensuring the fulfilment of the client’s
    requirements and the approval for the release of payment to the design team. Due
    to the increased complexity of the projects, the information requirements achievement
    and late payments are relevant factors in the trend of the industry [[1](#CR1)].
    The presented framework of the research is still at its theoretical level, in
    Sect. [3](#Sec5) the project on which the framework will be tangibly tested as
    a proof of concept has been anticipated. The future testing of the framework and
    the analysis of the results obtained will indeed be the next steps of the proposed
    research development. Therefore, in this section, the expected outcomes are disclosed
    and discussed, and their identification can be considered as a benchmark for comparing
    the future results. The main purpose of the framework relies on the integration
    between the information management based on BIM and the blockchain network to
    improve the link between the client and the design team, in the design phase.
    The combined environment presented in the research enables contracting parties
    to produce, review and maintain the same information exhaustively. Using the focus
    on process automation, the activities of controlling and validating the information,
    as well as those of approving the payment release, are executed by coded applications
    instead of humans’ implemented procedures. This innovative approach boosts the
    shortening of the design phase execution, facilitates the control of any rework

- en: The information management practices recommended by the ISO 19650 series promote
    constant interaction among the parties in the process. The information management
    based on BIM is characterised by the complete exchange of digital information
    whose revisions are dynamically reported and integrated, improving control over
    the project's progress and reducing non-conformities. Due to the high information
    content of BIM models, it is appropriate to adopt applications that automatically
    detect errors and non-conformities, facilitating a positive response to the client’s
    information requirements. Once all information included in the BIM models is completed,
    it is necessary to proceed with its verification to confirm compliance with the
    guidelines’ requirements. As earlier underlined, in the BIM environment the validation
    of information produced by the design team becomes a fundamental activity for
    the respect  of the client’s requirements. Indeed, the imprecise execution of
    this activity would not only have a negative effect on the project development
    and management, nevertheless, it would also generate potentially costly inaccuracies,
    therefore, necessarily to be avoided. To support this task, the development of
    an application that allows the automatic verification of information becomes crucial

- en: With the aim of automatically and digitally validating the fulfilment of the
    client’s information requirements, the architecture of the application was developed
    through four main activities. Thanks to the first tests of this application, some
    expected benefits can be summarised. Firstly, the setup of an application for
    automatic information validation could provide the client with an effective tool
    for reviewing carefully the information produced by the design team. The adoption
    of such a verification process supports the improvement of the communication between
    the client and the design team. The validation of information produced during
    the design phase is no longer a manual, time-consuming and jagged activity, in
    fact it becomes comprehensive and detailed. Secondly, the design team would, therefore,
    be encouraged to produce information in compliance with the client’s information
    requirements to reduce working time and the likelihood of rework. At the same
    time, in the event of a negative review result, obtaining a detailed report containing
    all the rejected elements facilitates the design team in implementing targeted
    and fast corrections and supplementations. Finally, the client can monitor the
    actual progress of the project and the accuracy of the design teams. The detailed
    verification of the models ensures that the information requirements are met,
    and the automation of the process considerably reduces the traditional verification
    and validation time. Based on some initial experimentations, a statistical comparison
    between the time spent to verify the project using the traditional process and
    the automated one shows a time reduction of nearly 60% with a sample of two buildings
    (Fig. [6](#Fig6)). The BIM models related to these buildings were developed by
    the external design teams for the real digitalisation of the real estate assets
    requested and initiated by RAI. The BIM models are related to office buildings
    and recording studios, and their surface is about 15000sqm for project A and 12000 sqm
    for project B. For each BIM model, the appointed design teams developed four BIM
    models covering the four main disciplines. To highlight the innovative value of
    the automatic verification proposed in the research, the verifications of these
    models were carried out in both manual and automatic ways, in compliance with
    the two macro-categories of rule sets illustrated in Sect. [4.1](#Sec7). The statistical
    analysis will be further developed and improved during the evolution of the research.![](../images/504856_1_En_4_Chapter/504856_1_En_4_Fig6_HTML.png)

    requires an appropriate selection and configuration. Among the possible types
    of blockchains, the permissioned ones were considered the most suitable types
    of networks for the research, which is set in a proprietary environment. Hyperledger
    Fabric was proposed as it is built for enterprise business. The permissioned network
    allows only selected participants to collaborate and transact, indeed network
    participants are known and acknowledged when setting up and running the network.
    This network guarantees privacy and the control of identity. Thanks to the correspondence
    between the digital identities and the social ones of each peer, the private network
    is easier to be implemented in the real scene than the public one, with higher
    operating efficiency, better transactions performance and lower costs [[42](#CR42)].
    In the explored design phase, the use of such a network allows the client to filter
    accesses, identify participants and guarantee the privacy and security of communication
    and information exchange. To set up and test the identified network in the research,
    its architecture was defined by pinpointing the working channel, participants,
    assets and expected transactions. The goal of automating both the validation of
    information included in BIM models and the consequent approval of the release
    of the payment, using smart contracts, highlighted the need to reliably connect
    the BIM process with the blockchain network. The import of external data into
    blockchain is made using an oracle, able to connect in a trusted way the application
    previously defined for the automatic BIM validation and the automatic business
    logic at the basis of the smart contract. This means that a participant, in this
    case, the verifier of the BIM models, becomes the trusted organisation operating
    in a separate channel. Only the oracle is authorised to post updates to the oracle
    smart contract, these updates would be the external data related to the results
    of the automatic validation. Since the oracle added operates in a different channel,
    the smart contract between the client and the design team would access the desired
    data (i.e. the validation report) via an inter-channel smart contract query.

- en: The presented framework of the research intends to demonstrate that the advent
    of new technologies could support positively the digitalisation of the construction
    industry. The proposed framework illustrates how the adoption of the automatic
    BIM validation and smart contracts could streamline and shorten the design phase
    execution. The chapter points out the integration between the information management
    based on BIM and blockchain as a solution to the weaknesses of the client’s requirements
    fulfilment, reliable information review and validation, and late payments. The
    combination of the two technologies offers enormous value and could be considered
    an appropriate direction for the efficient development of the design phase, thus
    attracting industry players. The potential offered by the framework could fully
    exploit the information of a BIM-based project. During the discussion of the expected
    outcomes, it was briefly shown how the automated verification of the information
    contained in the BIM models can significantly reduce the time taken to verify
    the project in compliance with the client’s information requirements. The application
    of the automatic design validation would allow, through the integration and use
    of blockchain, to automate the entire process until complete validation and this
    would be demonstrated through the development and testing of the proof of concept.
    Further developments of the research could involve the validation of the framework
    for the other verification procedures such as clash detection and code checking,
    so that the approved BIM models could be used as a legal reference both in the
    tender and construction phase, as a reference for monitoring the fulfilment of
    all the project requirements and specifications, or in the maintenance and operational
    phase, as an updated database of the building life cycle.
