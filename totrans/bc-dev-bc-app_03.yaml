- en: 'Chapter 3: Blockchain FinanceThe Benefits of Blockchain in FinanceBlockchain
    is a major innovation in the finance industry. It has the potential to reduce
    fraud, lower transaction times and manage any risks that may occur being an interconnected
    global financial system. The benefits are:●     TransparencyIt has standards in
    place that keep all users in mind and all processes are shared. All transactions
    can be viewed via a node or by making use of blockchain explorers. Explorers are
    websites that let you see transactions happening in real time.●     TrustThe transparency
    and fixed nature of the ledger makes it easy for all users to cooperate and be
    productive.●     PrivacyBusinesses can be selective of the data they share in
    a business network. They have the choice to keep privileged information private
    but ensure that all parties have access to the information they need which is
    in line with transparency but still allows for a level of confidentiality.●     Superior
    performanceOn a daily basis, hundreds if not thousands of transactions can be
    made and recorded on one network. From time to time there is a spike in network
    activity but it has been built to sustain that.●     SecurityThe blockchain framework
    eliminates single points of failure and middlemen, so there are less people involved
    in the assessing and recording of a business''s data. The Ethereum blockchain
    has specialized application code that is fortified. It is almost impossible to
    hack.The Possible Drawbacks of Blockchain in FinanceA lot of the transactional
    tasks that have to be performed by individuals and companies these days are cumbersome.
    Blockchain has the potential to improve on a lot of those things just by it being
    automated. It’s important to note though, that the bigger the network gets, the
    more impractical it becomes to maintain.The concept of blockchain is rooted in
    democracy because there is no central authority. Things are also more secure because
    there is no single point of failure. When a company builds its own blockchain,
    they are the only ones who have reasons to maintain it. In this way, nodes could
    become centralized and that is contrary to the purpose of a blockchain.There is
    a great level of trust on the Bitcoin blockchain because Bitcoins are mined on
    it and everyone can see what happens to them from the moment they are mined to
    the time they end up in a person’s wallet. In the finance industry however, the
    assets being traded and recorded exist outside of the blockchain. Nobody can be
    100% certain that all the information being logged on a blockchain is completely
    accurate and without mistakes. This could be a potential trust issue.Lastly, Blockchains
    are completely digital and use up an enormous amount of computing power. One day
    there may not be enough computer power in the world to sustain them.How the Digitization
    of Financial Instruments Could Impact FinanceBlockchain technology works very
    well in the world of cryptocurrency and has the potential to revolutionize financial
    services across the board.Digitization takes the benefits of blockchain and applies
    them to the financial services sector. The way things work in the financial market
    will change and new standards will be set, bringing worthwhile changes at every
    turn.Financial instruments in a digital format would offer several benefits. Some
    of which include:● Credibility and scarcity: When data is in a digital format,
    it can be easily verified which makes it easier to trust.● Programming capacity:
    Integrity and effectiveness would be on a whole new level because of tamper-proof
    software and Smart contracts.● Efficient processes: Mechanized processes take
    the efficiency of operations up a notch by reducing waiting times and cutting
    out intermediaries. Auditing and reporting can be monitored while it''s being
    done, so there’s less room for error.● Economic benefits: Automation means doing
    away with a lot of redundant processes in order to achieve the same result. It
    brings infrastructure and operation costs down and increases liquidity.● Market
    reactivity: Digital securities depict ownership of an asset. Should there be a
    need to alter or review this information it can be done way faster than with standardized
    securities. Other financial instruments can also be converted into a digital format
    to suit the needs of different investors.● New markets and products: New products
    include fast, safe and adjustable transferal of assets, subdivided ownership of
    tangible assets and moreThe effects of these benefits on operations would be major.
    Governance systems would be transparent and business models would improve. There
    would also be minimal operation costs that would free up some capital and increase
    liquidity.There are a few companies that have slowly started implementing blockchain
    technology but they’re still in the experimental phase. If they implemented it
    and used it at its full capacity it could improve the following:PaymentsSending
    money from one country to another the normal way takes time and ends up costing
    a lot of money in fees. Each party that has a hand in getting the money from point
    A to B receives a fee. If more people made use of blockchain applications this
    process would be faster, cheaper, and more secure.● There would be more than one
    way to pay. Customers would be able to send Fiat money or cryptocurrency.● The
    chances of falling victim to fraud would be significantly lower because of facilities
    like Know Your Customer (KYC). KYC is a set of standards that was created to protect
    financial institutions against fraud and money-laundering. There are several steps
    involved to ascertain customer identity, be sure of the nature of a customer’s
    activities and ensure that wherever the money’s coming from, it’s legal. They
    also work to assess the risk of money-laundering with each customer.● Smart contracts
    allow for two parties to enter into an agreement and for that information to be
    stored in the blockchain.Asset ManagementReal estate funds, Private equity firms
    and venture capital companies have to try and keep up with the ever-changing regulations
    in their sector. It’s a task to stay compliant. Blockchains host of financial
    services can help them manage their assets and Blockchain security could further
    safeguard them.Asset management can be improved through:● Tokenizing securities
    and offering more liquidity. Tokenization is turning data like account numbers
    into an arbitrary string of characters called a token. The token becomes like
    a reference to the original data but does not expose the actual value of it.●     Confidential
    transactions having bespoke privacy settings●     Initiating a decline in human
    error in shareholder voting●     Better administration with more clarity for investorsHow
    Does Blockchain Impact Capital MarketsCapital market is a blanket term that describes
    all the ways individuals, businesses and government trade financial instruments.
    They trade through the stock, bond, currency and foreign exchange markets. Most
    of the world’s biggest markets are located in Hong Kong, London, New York and
    Singapore. Capital markets have suppliers and entities that make use of funds.
    Suppliers include retirement funds and companies that have surplus cash. The funds
    disbursed on capital markets are used mostly by people looking to purchase assets
    and governments that need financing for operating costs and infrastructure expenditure.The
    markets are divided into two categories:●     Primary marketsWhen a company makes
    an Initial Public Offering (IPO) , it happens in the primary market. When stakeholders
    acquire securities on the market, the company supplying the securities hires an
    underwriter to review it and produce an outline that states the price and other
    details of the securities being supplied. Everything pertaining to the primary
    market operates under strict regulations. Companies are required to file statements
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other agencies before they
    can go public.●     Secondary marketsSecondary markets are divided into Auction
    and Dealer markets. The auction market is where buyers and sellers gather and
    state the prices they are willing to buy and sell their securities for. One example
    is the New York Stock Exchange. Smaller investors trade through the dealer markets
    because trade mostly happens electronically.Companies have a number of hurdles
    in the market. The regulations are stringent which makes it take longer for them
    to get to market and interest rates are volatile, which threatens their liquidity.Blockchain
    improves the way companies are able to operate in the Capital market by removing
    the single point of failure through decentralization and expediting capital market
    ventures by ensuring the efficacy of all processes.'
