    technology trends poised to explode in the next decade. Most important among them,
    for blockchain, are IoT and AI. Today we think of organizations as made up mostly
    of people. Yet in a short few years, the number of intelligent assets in an organization

    cities. Security guards might “rent” a unit when the real property owners are
    out of town, or the tenants themselves might allow illegal sublets. The challenge
    of housing fraud is pushing China to try a different approach. In the northern
    city of Xiong’an, planners aim to fight housing fraud and improve access to property
    for tenants with the support of blockchain. A representative from Ant Financial
    explained the approach: “The blockchain will be used to validate that the property
    is real. The landlord and the tenant will consent on the blockchain to the terms
    and conditions of the rental. Another benefit of blockchain is that when tenants
    apply for a housing loan, they do not need to involve multiple agencies to prove
    the truthfulness of their rental. As a result, this blockchain rental solution
    allows tenants to enjoy a more convenient property rental experience.”[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch7-en1)

    For example, an investor looking into farming data to price a commodity might

    Theoretically, the organization will access huge volumes of data, draw conclusions

    just a few minutes. The terms of competition between two organizations with these
    capabilities could hinge on the smallest differences in opportunism—or in ethics.
    Competitive pressure will be fierce, creating a potential race to the bottom in
    terms of how low companies are willing to go to create value. Do we really want
    the DAOs operating in this world to do so with no limits? Do we want these organizations
    to be able to collude? The short-term experience with algorithms designed to replace
    human judgment in certain arenas—law enforcement and mortgage approval, to name

    Employers like to say that workers with high-demand skills have power, because
    the organization needs them to meet customer demand. High-demand workers may have
    some power, but it is diminished by corporate policy limits on employee pay and
    benefit and where they can work. Evaluation methods likewise dictate, usually

    HR functions, for example, are exploring blockchain solutions to verify applicant
    credentials. The blockchain startup APPII is offering a platform for that purpose.
    Some tools will also allow employees to develop skills and renew certifications,

    student credentials and match students with teachers for skill development. These
    examples are compatible with hierarchical organizational structures and are designed
    from the perspective of the organization. Such a perspective is applicable in
    today’s hierarchical environment, though we suggest that Colony’s vision of a
    two-way balance, whereby leaders evaluate workers and workers evaluate leaders,
    offers a more interesting and valuable model for the future. As seen earlier in
    [figure 8-1](#fig8-1), moving from the traditional top-down structure to a more
    flexible, horizontal one implies a shift toward a holacracy—the organizational
    model that Zappos has adopted.

    workers (human beings or things) will choose whether to bid on a task or participate
    in a project; they won’t be assigned, as they are in most environments today.
    Importantly, the opt-in model could be used as easily with an internal talent
    pool as with a decentralized workforce. The model could operate by having all
    participants identified with a tokenized set of data that documents their skills,
    knowledge, credentials, reliability, preferred schedule, and past achievements.
    Lubin said that ConsenSys is experimenting with a token-reward system that rewards
    people for filling out onboarding information, for example, or putting their skills

    regulators turn to leaders to make good. In extreme cases, those leaders can go
    to jail. That’s a pretty good motivator to stay on the right side of the law.
    As we have highlighted throughout this chapter, however, decentralized organizations
    with operations unfolding autonomously over a network don’t have leaders in the
    same way that hierarchical organizations operating in the physical world do. Can
    a DAO in this situation even be regulated? Should DAOs be regulated in the same
    way that a traditional human-centric organization is regulated? If a regulatory
    breach—even one caused by a mistake in one line of code out of millions—should
    occur, who should bear the brunt of the responsibility? We don’t know the answers

    policy to code leadership oversight into the operations of DAOs. But maintaining

    how blockchain can be used today and tomorrow to reinvent who your customers and
    partners are and how you engage with them. Yet even with that business focus,
    our research into blockchain has always touched on the ways it could fundamentally
    change the rules of engagement in broader society. After all, enterprises are
    both dependent on society and enablers of it. Society establishes the infrastructure
    in which business operates, and businesses, in turn, feed society through employment,
    economic engagement, and applied innovation. We cannot talk about one without
    recognizing the influence of the other.

    friendly are already emerging in the blockchain world. The highest-profile model
    among them is taking place in Estonia.[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en1) The country
    has built a digital platform known as X-Road and connected Estonia’s government
    agencies to it. X-Road is at once comprehensive and contained: it underpins a
    variety of private and public services from health care to finance, yet no individual
    service can access information from another without permission from the person
    to whom the information refers. Views of given records are also tracked and recorded,
    and the viewer’s right to the information is authenticated.'

    eyes of Estonian society that businesses build their platforms on it. The Finnish
    government is likewise leasing X-Road for its digital infrastructure, raising
    new questions about the portability of citizenship services, the nature of borders,
    and government sovereignty. Estonia is pushing those questions with an e-residency
    model that allows non-Estonians to apply for Estonian residency and thereafter
    establish their businesses and pay their taxes there. As a small country with
    limited natural resources and a history of geopolitical vulnerability, Estonia
    is making a play for long-term economic independence by appealing to EU entrepreneurs.

    a fraction of what a comparable platform would need to in London or New York (population
    more than 8 million), to say nothing of Mexico City or Beijing (population over
    20 million). Still, the country is far from alone in its view of the importance
    of a network that allows for peer-to-peer information sharing. Blockchain can
    clearly build on this foundation and can be used for its broader set of capabilities
    for reinventing societal service and engagement. Lithuania—with its hightech sector,
    cheap internet access, and sophisticated fintech and regtech (technologies addressing
    regulatory issues) initiatives—has embraced cryptocurrencies and was third in
    the world for ICO investment in 2018, behind the United States and China.[²](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en2)
    Malta’s government has weighed in to legitimize the development of blockchain
    by creating a regulatory body to oversee smart contracts and DAOs.[³](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en3)

    Japan has implemented regulatory guidelines to permit the trade in cryptocurrencies.

    Globalism and technological automation had clearly brought dramatic growth but
    with visible unintended consequences, most notably an increase in income inequality.
    Fiat currencies have long been considered a symbol of trust, since fiat implies
    that a trusted authority—a central bank—has made a qualitative judgment about
    the ability of credited financial institutions to act in the best interest of
    the system and in turn to make reasoned judgments about the ability of borrowers
    to repay borrowed funds. When those institutions needed to be saved using taxpayer
    dollars, with no consequences for their millionaire leaders, it was a breach in
    the social contract.

    prove that the world is better off with them than without (acknowledging that
    different actors define benefits in different ways). Members of society also give
    implicit authority to the search engines, phones, smart home devices, social media
    platforms, and GPS that all of us use to manage our lives. As digitalization and
    social media give democratized insight into the ways that explicit and implicit
    authority are overlapping and even usurping each other, however, it is now clear
    that the once-trusted institutions are advancing goals that many citizens neither
    approve of nor benefit from. Schisms have become more pronounced, and trust at

    by citizens who are unable to meet basic needs like food, housing, income, health

    to be, frankly, Orwellian. In this *programmed society*, a very small number of
    organizations could own vast stores of information pertaining to the behaviors,
    movements, finances, spending patterns, and even the health and DNA of individuals.
    Under these circumstances, *choice* would translate to “whatever options the data
    broker benefits most from promoting.” The implicit social contract would be that
    both individuals and organizations relinquish control over data, access to digital
    resources, related contracts, and technology in exchange for consumerism and visibility
    on digital platforms. News organizations could present information in selective
    and misleading ways. The rewards from work and societal engagement would be unequally
    distributed. Human rights could be broadly curtailed, for example, by limiting
    eligibility for health services, admission to certain universities, and home purchases
    in certain neighborhoods. Organizations could limit hiring to people with desired
    DNA profiles or according to a social credit system designed by and benefiting
    an oligopoly.

    world emerge. But others live in that world already. Billions of people experience
    systemic bias in their daily interactions. While there is some good in almost
    every society, humans still universally fail at giving all members of a society
    equal access to societal rights and public resources. This failing applies at
    all levels, be it an organizational level or a governmental one. Some forms of
    disenfranchisement are intentional (e.g., when groups are denied suffrage because
    of gender, race, age, or organizational seniority), and some is incidental (e.g.,
    when the lack of a photo ID prevents someone from accessing health services or
    voting). In a programmed society, this bias could worsen, because the ability
    to define privilege and reward or deny it would become easier, more automated,
    and more broadly applied.

    effective and proactive participation. A decentralized societal model will arise
    only when the technologies we have discussed throughout this book are deployed
    at commercial scale. Decentralized governance models such as holacracies and futarchies
    would likewise facilitate a more empowered model. The social contract would enable
    individuals and organizations to liberate data and give them access to digital

    in self-representation, access, value exchange, and distribution of societal benefits.
    This society is enabled not by one ledger operating in a networked, digital environment,
    but by a collection of decentralized blockchain networks that overlap with and
    weave into each other to create a mesh capable of cross-network transactions.
    [Chapter 4](../Text/chapter04.html) touched on this interoperability, showing
    how reward points could morph into tokens that are first used with one vendor
    and then with multiple providers across an ecosystem. In another example of interoperability,
    gaming tokens could be used across multiple games on new aggregator platforms.
    At Gartner, we have termed this interoperable mesh of blockchain networks the
    World Wide Ledger (WWL).[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch9-fna) The WWL enables dapps
    and distributed ledgers to power up DAOs independently or as embedded units within
    any centralized organization. WWL therefore introduces a global trust fabric that
    allows decentralized and centralized organizational units and operations to coexist.

    deeply entrenched and increasingly dystopian. Alternatively, societies that see
    limited digitalization and become more decentralized could experience *social
    decentralization*. In this scenario, citizens in community or tribal groups might
    pool data to access limited digital resources and related contracts and technology
    or as a way to affect social outcomes for those groups. Given the current pace

    always have, on the basis of tribal, geographic, cultural, linguistic, economic,
    or ideological connections. But in a blockchain society, the participants will

    began as a pilot with a few hundred refugees and is now under consideration for
    rollout to all 500,000 Syrian refugees living in Jordan and receiving WFP support.

    record of the results paves the way for predictive algorithms to run over voting
    systems. Predictive tools in a society could enable a futarchical government,
    a model of governance proposed by economist Robin Hanson. In a futarchical government,
    societies define broad measures of well-being and use predictive tools to assess
    which policies or approaches are the most likely to bring about the desired outcomes.
    There are obvious concerns about voting. For instance, if early votes begin favoring
    one approach, could they influence people to vote with the crowd even if the result
    would conflict with the voter’s personal beliefs? But the potential to bring societies

    in Brooklyn, New York. With the help of LO3 Energy, a provider of blockchain energy

    has established a microgrid to self-generate solar energy and sell it to others
    in the vicinity.[^(22)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en22) The Brooklyn experiment is
    possible because a cluster of homeowners had already made a group purchase of
    solar panels. LO3 Energy and Con Ed then worked with the panel owners to create
    platforms and apps that monitor generation and that, instead of feeding excess
    energy to the Con Ed system, enable locals without panels to buy the excess. The
    experiment in decentralized energy was explicitly supported by the city government,
    which is interested in exploring ways to relieve New York’s aging infrastructure.

    have invested significant resources in small-scale mobile solutions for energy,
    water, medical care, and other social services, with mixed results. One unresolved
    issue involves the maintenance and repair of physical infrastructure after the
    donor or installer leaves. Local communities don’t always know how to fix broken
    equipment, or they lack the parts to make repairs. Nor is it obvious who should
    foot the bill when shared resources break down. NGOs and development finance institutions
    are therefore investing in community engagement. They are actively collaborating
    with local representatives so that community investments reflect current needs.
    A life-cycle view of infrastructure is increasingly part of these conversations,
    which blockchain can facilitate by improving traceability, visibility, and access
    and by reducing fraud or corruption. By supporting fair access to, and distribution
    of, resources, blockchain would make its financial and social impacts more salient.

    which works with municipalities to identify local projects that need funding and
    then develops a municipal bond issue to raise money for the projects. Local governments
    can use the platform to raise money for school building maintenance, road repair,
    public park infrastructure, and other community resources. The blockchain keeps
    a record of who owns the issued bonds and ensures that those investors receive
    their returns when the bonds vest. Because the bonds are formally registered and
    have official ratings, they are low risk and are widely available because of relatively
    low minimum investment levels. They are also tradable at any time on the secondary
    bond market.

    We have repeatedly tried to debunk the idea of blockchain as an unhackable system.
    Though aspects of blockchain-complete solutions make them difficult to compromise,
    there are still vulnerabilities in the peripheral technologies used with or on
    top of the blockchain ledger. Cryptocurrency wallets, for example, are insecure
    in their current form, and there have been multiple compromises of token holdings
    at crypto exchanges as well as hacks to smart contract code. IoT systems are also
    highly insecure; they currently lack checks and balances to confirm if the data
    captured and imported reflect reality.

    and network access are all enabled through the use of security keys, which are
    much like passwords but are issued by the solutions themselves. And just as they
    do with passwords, participants must keep track of keys. Lose them, and you lose
    access to your tokens, your IDs, and so forth, and there is no way to recover
    them. Loss of a key is a major risk in an entirely digital system. A real-world
    demonstration of the risk took place in February 2019, when the CEO of a crypto-exchange
    died in possession of the only key to the stored $137 million in tokens.[^(28)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en28)

    more programmable. Societal systems designed to capture member data will underlie
    all programmable environments, whether they are programmed or blockchain. How
    can we as leaders and society members be sure that no single actor gains access
    to all of it? We can start by building decentralized systems and rejecting the
    centralized models pushed by powerful corporations. This strategy would require
    consumers to move en masse away from the proven, centralized platforms that give
    us so many benefits. Such a change will not happen in democratic societies without
    strong commercial alternatives. Data decentralization in nondemocratic societies
    will be even more challenging, since government agencies in these societies have
    few restrictions on what they can access. The social scoring system described
    in [chapter 7](../Text/chapter07.html) in the context of smart cities takes on
    a more sinister cast when a government can use it without limits. China’s social
    credit system is already reportedly influencing who is allowed to travel by airplane

    organization requires participants to join the collaboration, so too does the
    blockchain society. The rewards and incentive model native to blockchain could
    help drive that participation. The complicated role played by things has great
    bearing on a blockchain society. Machines that can interact with each other and
    exchange value may create governance rules for themselves. This self-governing
    ability gives a whole new angle to the idea of shared intelligence and shared
