    technology trends poised to explode in the next decade. Most important among them,
    for blockchain, are IoT and AI. Today we think of organizations as made up mostly
    of people. Yet in a short few years, the number of intelligent assets in an organization
    could dwarf the number of people, as organizations embed billions of devices and
    sensors in their products and infrastructure. Today we think of people making
    decisions and taking actions. Soon, many decisions will be translated into algorithms
    and executed autonomously.

    cities. Security guards might “rent” a unit when the real property owners are
    out of town, or the tenants themselves might allow illegal sublets. The challenge
    of housing fraud is pushing China to try a different approach. In the northern
    city of Xiong’an, planners aim to fight housing fraud and improve access to property
    for tenants with the support of blockchain. A representative from Ant Financial
    explained the approach: “The blockchain will be used to validate that the property
    is real. The landlord and the tenant will consent on the blockchain to the terms
    and conditions of the rental. Another benefit of blockchain is that when tenants
    apply for a housing loan, they do not need to involve multiple agencies to prove
    the truthfulness of their rental. As a result, this blockchain rental solution
    allows tenants to enjoy a more convenient property rental experience.”[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch7-en1)

    the external environment.”[⁴](../Text/notes.html#ch7-en4) These embedded objects
    enable numerous practical applications. In the pharmaceutical sector, for example,
    sensors in the packaging of temperature-sensitive medication can activate an embedded
    cooling function if conditions inch above a certain level, saving millions of
    dollars in inventory and possibly saving lives.[⁵](../Text/notes.html#ch7-en5)
    In smart cities, IoT could be used in public transportation to observe demand

    and techniques vary, we use the term broadly in a blockchain context to refer
    to intelligent algorithms that operate *and adjust* autonomously (i.e., without
    human intervention) to enable more effective data management and thereby expedite
    transaction flows and interactions. When combined with IoT, AI can examine the
    data collected by a network of distributed and diverse things, draw conclusions
    from it, and act on the information in real time. In a city, simple examples of
    those actions might include changing traffic lights to ease congestion, adjusting
    energy allocation across the smart grid, dispatching police patrols according
    to signs of conflict, or, as in Kansas City (which used an AI algorithm in its
    pothole pilot to analyze the video footage), prioritizing street maintenance.

    by diversifying and potentially decentralizing the source of the data used in
    some applications so that no single data point can dictate action. Consider the
    climate in your home, for example. If you live in an older building, you very
    likely have one thermostat that measures the temperature of the air in the room
    where it is located and then tells the heating and cooling system to adjust everywhere
    according to that reading. If the thermostat is in or near your kitchen, the story
    it tells about your home’s climate is warmer than the reality. If instead you
    had a set of mobile temperature sensors distributed throughout your home and installed
    a networked thermostat with which the sensors could communicate, the observable

    and outside a car can provide a more accurate version of the truth than the car
    owner could, especially if that owner were inclined to mislead a potential buyer

    manufactured products and offer compatible software to pull the data and analyze
    it. In this context, things don’t interact with each other but instead interact
    with a central platform. As IoT matures, however, the diversity and volume of
    interactions will increase significantly. The introduction of 5G technology will
    contribute to those increases. One outcome will be the ability of things to communicate
    directly with each other without needing a central platform to mediate that exchange.
    Another will be the greater variety and therefore value of information collected.
    Things in an office building, for example, will be able to talk to things in the
    utility-owned water pipes fifty yards away. These distributed things—owned by
    different entities and running on different technology—are going to need a way
    to identify each other, communicate, negotiate, and transact.

    For microtransactions, blockchain will enable more diverse forms of value. As
    we said in [chapter 1](../Text/chapter01.html), fiat and its proxies (bank accounts,
    credit cards, automated clearinghouses, SWIFT, etc.) weren’t built for the volume,
    the variety of assets, or the type of machine-to-machine microtransactions that
    are possible between things. When millions of these things can exchange individual
    units of energy or items of data, the size of any individual transaction drops
    well below $0.01, while the number of transactions multiplies to unfathomable
    scale. Operating in this high-volume, low-per-unit-value environment requires
    new forms of value and native currencies.

    digital. We’ve provided examples of how data could be exchanged and monetized

    attention could be sold to a content creator. The market value of an individual
    data point or five minutes of human attention will vary by market and context,
    but in general the value of individual transactions will be tiny—a few cents to
    a few dollars each. Exchanging that value securely and at extreme speeds between
    millions, even billions, of participants requires decentralized, autonomous, and
    tokenized mechanisms. Business leaders must therefore recognize the role of tokenization
    beyond fiat replacement and payments. What matters most is the ability to use
    tokens to *create and represent* new forms of value and enable new microtransactions
    of this value.

    When an insurance agent needs pictures of a house, for instance, it can order

    convenience and effectiveness of such a service would make it hard for the insurance
    company to switch to an alternative later, and Amazon gets a new source of revenue—and
    a new source of data—at a very low cost. In the same way that Trojan horse blockchain-inspired

    secure engagement models without prior physical contacts and lengthy contract
    negotiations. For example, drones would become a shared resource among companies
    operating across multiple industries, such as retail, logistics, and insurance,
    generating economies of scope. Thanks to the immutability of blockchain records,
    this arrangement would improve compliance with air-traffic regulation and facilitate
    insurance for drones by creating virtual flight-data “black boxes” for them. From
    a business model perspective, cross-industry value exchanges could be temporary
    and could transact in minuscule denominations. These exchanges would generate
    fee revenue governed by a smart contract, enabling the sharing of a data token
    in exchange for another form of value token, both tokens issued via the blockchain.
    For example, an investor looking into farming data to price a commodity might
    request access to data generated by another company using the drone. In this way,
    a blockchain multiplies business interactions and enables the discovery of new
    opportunities across industries, even reshaping industry boundaries.

    the city’s energy systems more resilient to storms or coastal flooding. The digitalizing
    effect of these recommendations is minimal, at the same time that they promote
    continued decentralization of ownership and decision making. This quadrant represents
    an interim step. Building owners, companies, citizens, and other stakeholders

    blockchain combined with IoT and AI cannot solve all the challenges of data privacy

    more transactional and socially responsive environment, in that citizens get a
    fair price for sharing data and can see how it is used. These transactions are
    not just about profit, but also about social goods such as access to housing,
    public transportation, clean air, and green space. Decentralized digitalization

    excessive distance between those who make decisions and those who interact most

    when the activities they are involved in require a range of expertise and viewpoints.
    The need for such a range was unusual when the world economy was dominated by
    companies that made physical products and when connectivity depended on the landline
    phone and the railways. But the need is the norm in digital environments, in particular

    positions because they demonstrate the ability to make strong, independent decisions
    without input from subordinates. In other words, they can become authoritarian.
    Alternatively, they may rise on account of their ability to be bureaucratic and
    follow a playbook of formal or informal rules. Last, they may be charismatic and
    attract employees and influence their actions because of personal affability.[^(14)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en14)

    open access, and open contribution. Add in all the technological things that will
    be making autonomous decisions with the help of AI, and you have another layer
    of self-directed and self-seeking objects that will hold considerable influence.
    Blockchain empowers those independent moving parts through decentralization, consensus,
    and individual incentives and rewards in the form of tokens. It is difficult to
    imagine power in that environment flowing to a leader calling out instructions
    from the front of the room.

    giant Toyota, for instance, is held up as a model of servant leadership because
    of its emphasis on coaching and developing others. This is not just talk. Toyota
    organizes its reporting structure (hierarchical, we should note) so that no leader
    has more than eight direct reports.[^(16)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en16) The purpose
    is to give leaders the time they need to coach their direct reports while also
    receiving coaching from their direct leader for their business-line responsibilities

    a group in the traditional sense. There is no leader, and participants are not
    chosen. Swarms are holacratic: participants self-select to the swarm and self-manage
    while in it. This quality suggests that successful blockchain leaders will be
    skilled at framing goals or problems and encouraging qualified participants to
    opt in to a project. Clear goal framing, clear definitions of desired outcomes,
    and clear incentives allow participants to join and take actions that benefit
    them as individuals and the network as a whole. Blockchain solutions like Colony
    or Bounty0x, a task-posting blockchain solution, can provide the technical mechanisms
    by which organizations and participants execute on the vision.[^(17)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en17)'

    formed or participated in agile teams or whose organizations have taken a bimodal
    approach to digital transformation will be familiar with this type of team development.[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch8-fna)
    Blockchain leaders will need skills similar to those of agile leaders. They must
    maintain a broad overview, seeing connections between the disparate parts and
    identifying any needs. Instead of communicating from the top down, a blockchain
    leader will connect people, things, or resources that might not be aware of each
    other.[^(18)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en18) The leaders will continue doing so
    until things become smart enough to discover and engage with each other.

    information, they can autonomously shift to an alternative course of action. Leaders
    in this environment will likewise need to quickly adapt to new information. They
    cannot get too attached to a five-year strategic plan or any other predetermined
    outcome if the evidence suggests that context has changed. [Figure 8-1](#fig8-1)

    human judgment in certain arenas—law enforcement and mortgage approval, to name
    two—shows that algorithms can carry the same biases that humans do. As a leader,

    participants to help you pursue your organizational goals. This approach gives
    people the opportunity to participate according to their capabilities. Once people
    join in, you will need a way to evaluate the quality of their work, compensate
    them for their contributions, and create incentives for them to stay or return.

    Employers like to say that workers with high-demand skills have power, because
    the organization needs them to meet customer demand. High-demand workers may have
    some power, but it is diminished by corporate policy limits on employee pay and

    from the perspective of the organization. Such a perspective is applicable in
    today’s hierarchical environment, though we suggest that Colony’s vision of a
    two-way balance, whereby leaders evaluate workers and workers evaluate leaders,
    offers a more interesting and valuable model for the future. As seen earlier in
    [figure 8-1](#fig8-1), moving from the traditional top-down structure to a more

    Importantly, the opt-in model could be used as easily with an internal talent
    pool as with a decentralized workforce. The model could operate by having all
    participants identified with a tokenized set of data that documents their skills,
    knowledge, credentials, reliability, preferred schedule, and past achievements.

    As we have highlighted throughout this chapter, however, decentralized organizations
    with operations unfolding autonomously over a network don’t have leaders in the
    same way that hierarchical organizations operating in the physical world do. Can
    a DAO in this situation even be regulated? Should DAOs be regulated in the same
    way that a traditional human-centric organization is regulated? If a regulatory
    breach—even one caused by a mistake in one line of code out of millions—should
    occur, who should bear the brunt of the responsibility? We don’t know the answers
    to those questions, and regulators have not publicly weighed in on the regulatory
    nuances of blockchain governance, beyond some dialogue about cryptocurrencies.

    a physical environment, where most decisions are made by people, there are natural
    checks and balances. Leaders hear opinions from their superiors, peers, subordinates,
    and customers. An algorithm running on a blockchain does not receive such ongoing
    input. Unintended consequences will become clear eventually, but perhaps only
    after millions of interactions and transactions.

    policy to code leadership oversight into the operations of DAOs. But maintaining
    policy consistency and authority as DAOs grow to millions of lines of code applied
    in multiple jurisdictions and constantly updated might be challenging. Oversight

    the ability of credited financial institutions to act in the best interest of
    the system and in turn to make reasoned judgments about the ability of borrowers

    to be, frankly, Orwellian. In this *programmed society*, a very small number of

    movements, finances, spending patterns, and even the health and DNA of individuals.
    Under these circumstances, *choice* would translate to “whatever options the data
    broker benefits most from promoting.” The implicit social contract would be that
    both individuals and organizations relinquish control over data, access to digital
    resources, related contracts, and technology in exchange for consumerism and visibility
    on digital platforms. News organizations could present information in selective
    and misleading ways. The rewards from work and societal engagement would be unequally
    distributed. Human rights could be broadly curtailed, for example, by limiting
    eligibility for health services, admission to certain universities, and home purchases
    in certain neighborhoods. Organizations could limit hiring to people with desired
    DNA profiles or according to a social credit system designed by and benefiting

    every society, humans still universally fail at giving all members of a society
    equal access to societal rights and public resources. This failing applies at
    all levels, be it an organizational level or a governmental one. Some forms of
    disenfranchisement are intentional (e.g., when groups are denied suffrage because
    of gender, race, age, or organizational seniority), and some is incidental (e.g.,
    when the lack of a photo ID prevents someone from accessing health services or
    voting). In a programmed society, this bias could worsen, because the ability
    to define privilege and reward or deny it would become easier, more automated,

    This society is enabled not by one ledger operating in a networked, digital environment,
    but by a collection of decentralized blockchain networks that overlap with and
    weave into each other to create a mesh capable of cross-network transactions.
    [Chapter 4](../Text/chapter04.html) touched on this interoperability, showing
    how reward points could morph into tokens that are first used with one vendor
    and then with multiple providers across an ecosystem. In another example of interoperability,
    gaming tokens could be used across multiple games on new aggregator platforms.
    At Gartner, we have termed this interoperable mesh of blockchain networks the
    World Wide Ledger (WWL).[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch9-fna) The WWL enables dapps

    to have a portion of their genome sequenced. Individuals use these kits to learn
    about their ethnic heritage or to determine if they carry certain gene mutations
    associated with a disease. For their part, the companies store the sequences and
    sell access to the data to third parties such as researchers or pharmaceutical
    companies. The people to whom that genomic data refers are not told when their
    data is shared; nor are they compensated for its use. This lack of control over
    genetic information is common in the medical and drug research industries.[^(12)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en12)

    access to it in exchange for value. This genome database could benefit private

    have invested significant resources in small-scale mobile solutions for energy,
    water, medical care, and other social services, with mixed results. One unresolved
    issue involves the maintenance and repair of physical infrastructure after the
    donor or installer leaves. Local communities don’t always know how to fix broken
    equipment, or they lack the parts to make repairs. Nor is it obvious who should
    foot the bill when shared resources break down. NGOs and development finance institutions
    are therefore investing in community engagement. They are actively collaborating
    with local representatives so that community investments reflect current needs.
    A life-cycle view of infrastructure is increasingly part of these conversations,
    which blockchain can facilitate by improving traceability, visibility, and access
    and by reducing fraud or corruption. By supporting fair access to, and distribution
    of, resources, blockchain would make its financial and social impacts more salient.

    consumers to move en masse away from the proven, centralized platforms that give
    us so many benefits. Such a change will not happen in democratic societies without
    strong commercial alternatives. Data decentralization in nondemocratic societies
    will be even more challenging, since government agencies in these societies have
    few restrictions on what they can access. The social scoring system described
