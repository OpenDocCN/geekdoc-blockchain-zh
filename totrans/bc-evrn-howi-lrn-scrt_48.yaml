    useful to all users. The more users, the more connections, the more value. Assuming
    a fixed number of tokens, each token becomes more valuable, because it’s “holding”
    more value in the network.

    versus the overall blockchain market capitalization (i.e., the total value of
    all altcoins) through the end of 2016, and see if it follows a similar pattern.

    linearly, the overall value of the blockchain market increased quadratically.
    The rocket took a while but finally achieved liftoff. So far, so good. Then came
    2017.

    a blockchain. (People can have multiple wallets.) So we must do the best we can
    with the data we have—such as using total wallets as a proxy for total users,
    as we’re doing here. If you’re analyzing a specific altcoin, you might also use
    number of transactions as a proxy for total number of users. Not perfect, but
    it’s what we have.'

    you see, then consider buying when the Value Per User dips below the dotted line.

    shoe retailer Zappos.

    a thriving high-tech community. Over the years, downtown Vegas—the “waving cowboy”
    Vegas you see in old movies—has stagnated, while the big money moved to the glitzy
    casinos on the Strip.

- en: Hsieh (pronounced “Shay”) moved his headquarters to Las Vegas, then began attracting
    investment to rebuild the downtown area—including a large public space called
    “Container Park,” built out of shipping containers and overseen by a flamethrowing
    praying mantis. (Hey, it’s Vegas.)
  prefs: []

- en: Container Park is an interesting experiment. Boutique shops and eclectic restaurants
    surround a large playground that’s enjoyed by both kids and adults. In one corner
    is a large stage for regular nighttime performances, complete with sofas and lounge
    chairs. It’s a hangout spot, a meeting place, and a shopping mall all rolled into
    one.

- en: Fittingly for an Internet entrepreneur, Hsieh has come up with a number of quantitative
    metrics for judging the success of his high-tech community. One of these is the
    number of “collisions,” or serendipitous encounters, between strangers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To technology innovators like Tony Hsieh, Steve Jobs, and Marissa Mayer, innovation
    happens when people from different backgrounds “collide” with each other in unexpected
    ways. Hsieh even measures “return on collisions,” or the value of his investment
    as measured by the number of random encounters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    You’ve seen it throughout this book, with our blockchain incubator, investor meetups,
    and blockchain conventions. A third metric, Increase in Connections, captures
    the spirit of Hsieh’s “return on collisions.”

    to what we’d expect. (The solid line matches the dotted line.) As the market went

    then fell into a depression (underpriced).
