    Obviously, Satoshi could gain both fame and fortune depending on his talent, but
    he deliberately avoids that, turning into quite a character and a thorough mystery.
    When Bitcoin was first developed, Satoshi participated as an anonymous guide,
    and as Bitcoin and Blockchain gained more and more popularity, however, he disappeared
    completely. He uses none of his Bitcoins with the total value of several billion
    US dollars, nor does he apply for any patent, and he never shows up—even when

    For example, shortly after a Japanese man was recognized as Satoshi, some people
    decided he was Australian, and then the New York Times claimed to have found the
    real Satoshi. A recent sensation was brought about by Australian entrepreneur
    Craig Stephen Wright, who declared himself the real Satoshi Nakamoto. On the BBC,
    and in The Economist and GQ, he showed a deal made in January 2009 by Satoshi
    transferring 10 Bitcoins to Harry Finney, one of the programmers who helped build
    the Bitcoin protocol. This deal was the first-ever transfer transaction within
    the Bitcoin system. At the same time, he also submitted over fifty patent applications
    to Britain involving Bitcoin and its underlying Blockchain technology.

    a distributed ledger in nature. That is, it is a ledger that cannot be modified,
    destroyed, or interrupted, and everyone can gain access to it. Therefore, how
    does one authenticate his identity based on the distributed ledger? First, he
    can publish a Bitcoin public key to announce that he has the private key corresponding
    to this public key; then, if he can sign a message with this private key, his
    words are demonstrated.

    and then came up with the laws of motion, there is also a person in the Blockchain
    field “hit” by vending machines, enabling him to propose the concept of “smart
    contract.” Vending machines are familiar to us, and these clumsy machines are
    very “smart,” as products are released once money is inserted into the machine.
    Although we have no idea about its internal working mechanism, it is common sense
    to us that a vending machine can provide various items after money is inserted.
    The person inspired by vending machines and who first conceptualized smart contract
    is Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, cryptographer, legal scholar, and inventor,
    of the concept of a smart contract. Some even believe that Nick Szabo is probably
    Satoshi Nakamoto. He is now raising funds to launch a Blockchain technology company.

    of Nick Szabo, vending machines take on a unique glamour, as when consumers insert
    money into them and select items they want to buy, an enforceable contract will
    be launched between consumers and vending machines. Buyers insert money into the
    machine and choose items, while sellers are responsible for providing products
    and small change through the internal logic of vending machines.

    some even become angry and kick the machine. However, the machine is actually
    very innocent. It may fail to identify coins because previous customers have inserted
    counterfeit money, so the machine has reason to refuse to release products. This
    is a kind of simplified smart contract.

    serving as the third party, can avoid such issues in a transaction, because the
    buyer’s payment for items will first be sent into Alipay, and only after the seller
    has delivered the items to the buyer will Alipay send him the payment. This way,
    the interests of two parties in a transaction are protected. It’s known as the
    model of secured transactions. Alipay, although it is a kind of payment tool,
    almost shares the same working mechanism with smart contract—based on trust. However,
    Alipay is also faced with a potential threat. If unidentified objects intrude
