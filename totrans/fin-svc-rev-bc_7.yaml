- en: 171.In the context of a blockchain-based system, overexploitation refers to
    the risk of network overload, deriving from too many transactions sent to the
    networks, without enough computational resources to process these transactions.
    This problem has been solved through the introduction of dynamically adjusted
    transaction fees (paid in tokens), which allow the system to self-manage these
    transactions without third-party intervention. Under-allocation refers instead
    to the risk of there not being a sufficient amount of computational resources
    contributed to the network, thereby hindering the security thereof. Most blockchain-based
    networks have solved this problem through the probabilistic allocation of a “block
    reward” to all those who contribute resources to the network.

- en: '174.From an economic standpoint, public goods are resources that are both non-excludable
    and non-rivalrous in consumption. More specifically, according to Gravelle and
    Rees, “The defining characteristic of a public good is that it is non-rival: consumption
    of it by one individual does not actually or potentially reduce the amount available
    to be consumed by another individual.” See Hugh Gravelle and Ray Rees, Ch. 14,
    “Market Failure and Government Failure,” Microeconomics, 3rd ed. (Harlow, Essex:
    Pearson Education Ltd., 2004): 326\. A quasi-public good is a resource that presents
    the characteristics of a public good, but that might be subject to partial excludability,
    partial rivalry, or partial diminishability. Bitcoin is only partially non-rival
    because, although one person using the Bitcoin network will generally have no
    impact on the usability of the system for others, if too many people are using
    the network at the same time, it might actually lead to a potential congestion
    of the system. It is partially excludable, because, to execute a transaction on
    the Bitcoin network, one needs to spend (and therefore first to acquire) some
    fraction of bitcoin.'

    transition functions, allowing users to create [any application] simply by writing

    by an attacker leading to its demise, and triggering a governance crisis that
    resulted in a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain supported by the majority of
    Ethereum developers, while the remaining part of the community decided to maintain
    the original blockchain—which became Ethereum Classic.

- en: 198.Automation also brings about an interesting gray area concerning the very
    nature of “managerial efforts.” What happens if tokens are sold for a DAO once
    (and only once) it is up and running, and operated by algorithmic governance?
    And suppose the objective of this DAO were solely to generate profits through
    automated trading rules for its token-holders. A judge may find herself in a gray
    area where it is not clear that the fourth prong of the Howey test is met, while
    it is clear that in this profit-only oriented case, the token should be treated
    as an investment security. There again, a clear determination of substance over
    form will undoubtedly be needed.

- en: 357.There are some interesting wrinkles in the ownership and recording of ownership
    of stocks. Formally, all US stocks are owned by the DTCC, and shareholders merely
    hold a claim on the original certificates. In Canada, CDS records ownership and
    transfers, but these transfers are recorded only at the broker level. This procedure
    has important implications for issuers. For example, suppose CIBC customers buy
    100,000 shares of Barrick Gold and sell 80,000\. Then CDS records only the net
    transfer of 20,000\. When Barrick needs to contact its owner for, say, the annual
    shareholder meeting, it needs to contact another third party, Broadridge, to collect
    the information on the current holders. Being a monopolist, Broadridge’s service
    comes at considerable cost.

- en: 360.Here is a simple mathematical description. The public key PUK is essentially
    a hash of the private key PRK, where a hash is a conversion of arbitrary-length
    text into a fixed-length combination of letters and numbers. For all practical
    purposes, this hash cannot be inverted, and so no one can derive PRK from PUK.
    Mathematically, we write H(PRK) = PUK. Next, combining the text of the transaction
    (MSG) with the hash of the private key and then hashing both delivers the signature
    SIG, H(MSG+H(PRK)) = SIG. So how does verification work? Well, the verifier has
    SIG, MSG, and PUK, so all she has to do is check if H(MSG+PUK) = SIG.

    Specifically, the Volcker Rule limits banks’ proprietary trading to market-making
    activities only. In illiquid markets, in particular, drawing the line between
    taking a position as part of a market-making activity and taking it to speculate
    on price changes can be difficult. Dealers may therefore appreciate technological
    advances that allow them to shorten the time they expect to hold an inventory.

    test determines whether a transaction is a security: Is there an investment of
    money? An expectation of profit? Is the investment in a common enterprise? Does
    profit come from the efforts of the promoter? Many tokens are set up as “usage”
    coins, but my reading is that (a) there is a tacit promise of value and thus price
    appreciation of the coin and (b) these coins are meant as compensation for firm
    insiders. The first point generates capital gains profits, the second implies
    a financial reward and hints at option value. In practice, tokens are traded like
    stocks on crypto security exchanges. Indeed, the SEC stated that DAO tokens were
    securities (sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131). Similarly, in its investor advisory
    section, the SEC highlights that tokens are often securities and should be treated

    written in Ethereum smart contract language Solidity. This contract or code governs
    the issuance protocol. Commonly, the contract specifies a particular time (measured
    in block numbers) during which it accepts payment, and it specifies who receives
    the tokens once payment has been received (e.g., pro-rate, first come first serve,
    etc). The contract’s code is publicly visible. For more information, see blockgeeks.com/guides/ico-basics.'

    system has been around since 2002.
