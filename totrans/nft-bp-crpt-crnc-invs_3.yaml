    wide variety of things. Thus, NFTs are not only suitable for collectibles, but
    also for financial products (derivatives), platform tokens (Layer 1 and Layer
    2 platform tokens), governance and social tokens. It will be exciting to see how
    NFT Liquidity Mining in particular prevails.

  zh: 交易卡牌游戏吸引了许多人。很可能，这是游戏和投资案例之间吸引人的混合体：你真的应该将Alpha版的[黑莲花](https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Singles/Alpha/Black-Lotus)换成国际版的[祖传召回](https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Magic/Products/Singles/International-Edition/Ancestral-Recall)吗？这在很大程度上取决于你是从投资的角度还是战略的角度来看待这件事。尽管黑莲花价值几乎是祖传召回的一百倍，但对于你自己的蓝色套牌而言，拥有一张祖传召回可能更有意义。如果你仍然意识到魔术等游戏的令人难以置信的复杂性，那么这样的游戏要么已经转移到了数字时代——参见《炉石传说》——要么完全重制。

    (now defunct) was originally planned as a trading exchange for trading cards.
    At the latest with the fall of MTGox, this bridge was torn down for the time being,
    but was rebuilt with projects such as CryptoKitties.'

- en: Sure, already regarding CryptoKitties an investment case can be discussed, but
    we would like to look at other games in this issue via the investment case Non-Fungible
    Token. Instead, we look at Gods Unchained as an example of an NFT-based game.
    The game has already been briefly watched in our series about Blockchain Gaming,
    but here we want to look less at the game than at the investment case.

- en: 'As soon as packs are available again, you should follow the announcements closely:
    Will there be something like the Mythical Cards that were released in the Genesis
    phase again? Some of these extremely rare cards were able to achieve very good
    prices on the markets. If there are such cards, you should take a close look at
    how they are distributed in the new packs. The Mythical Cards were distributed
    regardless of the type of pack. So the chances were the same; whether you bought
    a Rare Pack or a Shiny Legendary Pack. However, since the price of a Rare Pack
    was only a fraction of the price of a Shiny Legendary Pack, you could buy significantly
    more packs – and thus increase the probability of finding a Mythical card.'

    Rare Pack 还是 Shiny Legendary Pack。然而，由于 Rare Pack 的价格仅是 Shiny Legendary Pack 价格的一小部分，你可以购买更多的卡包——从而增加找到神话卡片的概率。 '
