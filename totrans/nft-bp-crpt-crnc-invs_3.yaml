    wide variety of things. Thus, NFTs are not only suitable for collectibles, but
    also for financial products (derivatives), platform tokens (Layer 1 and Layer
    2 platform tokens), governance and social tokens. It will be exciting to see how

    authenticity, not only about the ownership, in valuable paintings or sculptures.
    These could be verified and authenticated by experts before creating an NFT whose
    possession simultaneously reflects the ownership and authenticity of a collectible.
    Thus, two central problems of the art world, namely the falsifying of valuable
    works and the fraudulent trade in stolen pieces, can be curbed.

    same smart contract with the same token number. This means that a manufactured
    token is single and solitary and cannot be produced or copied any other way. This
    is similar to the fact that the Guernica painting, which Picasso drew with his
    own hands, is priceless, although there are thousands of copies. This is confirmed
    by blockchain and can be seen by everyone.

    also means that the buyer has all commercial rights of the product, such as promotion

    to the knowledge that rare things are generally valuable, a very limited number
    of artists and producers have NFT, especially at this time. This is a good opportunity,
    especially in a constantly evolving virtual world where we cannot easily predict
    what will happen. If we make a very simple assumption that the values of the products
    offered for sale in the first place will be lower than in the future, it may also
    mean that we may have products that will be sold much more expensively in the
    future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can be retained for years. In other words, translating a product that you don't
