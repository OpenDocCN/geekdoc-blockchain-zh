    residents to have an identity card (Whitley and Hosein, 2009). In 1940, the Vichy
    government of France established an ID system with Greece and Poland, which is
    more or less retained until now. Barring a few exceptions, hardly any country
    with common law in the world has adopted a peacetime identification system.

    and access to such data. This could be the first step toward changing the governmental
    and corporate tendency to view data and technology services as tools of surveillance
    and a means of expanding their social control.

    implied mandatory nature of enrollments. Although the project document does not
    make it mandatory for an individual to obtain an Aadhaar number, it also does
    not prohibit an agency from demanding an Aadhaar number for availing a service.
    Taking advantage of this, in recent years, the government has made it obligatory
    to cede Aadhaar with PAN, passport, and ration cards, as a prerequisite to access
    the service (see [Figure 6.10](#c06-fig-0010)).

    barriers for the unprivileged section of the society, who are in dire need of
    access to limited benefits provided by the State. This remarkably differs from
    the United States, where a government agency cannot deny a benefit to an individual
    if he or she does not possess a Social Security number or refuses to disclose
    it, unless there is an express necessity under the law to do so.

    for public services suffered a setback, when the Supreme Court of India passed
    an interim order in a case, challenging the constitutional validity of the UIDAI.
    On March 16, 2015, the Apex Court made it clear that no person shall be denied
    any benefit or suffer for not having an Aadhaar card issued by the UIDAI. In light
    of the Court’s verdict, Aadhaar has lost its ground (The Economic Times, 2018).

- en: In this wake, it seems worthwhile to have a *One World – One Identity*, leveraging
    the advantages of a decentralized identity system. The unique identification number
    comprising 20 digits may be provided to one and all, at the time of birth or on
    the day of census. The Digital ID System (using an Interplanetary File System
    (IPFS) or the so-called Private Ledger) would record all substantive data of a
    citizen, including digital identification number, name of the citizen, date of
    birth, family details, photograph, biometric details, digital signatures, educational
    progress, extra-academic achievements, employment details, transfers and switch-overs,
    driving license, vehicle registration, mobile phone, PAN, LPG, bank accounts,
    financial assets, liabilities, passports, visas, foreign travel, legal and medical
    records, rewards, and punishments from time to time in distributed ledgers (Garg,
    2021d).

    during his lifetime and save the system from fake accounts, forged identity, and
    data breaches. Though provision of multiple services to a massive population by
    government and private organizations is a gigantic task; however, *One World –
    One Identity* would help in improved educational, banking, investment, health
    care, public distribution schemes and other services, where a single card with
    unique number would hold all the substantive data of a citizen, whether it be
    personal, biometric, educational, extracurricular, vocational, medical, legal,
    or financial, in different silos, in a duly encrypted manner (Garg, 2022a). A
    single ID would reinforce national and social security for citizens and serve
    as an instrument to allow access to varied government and private services (i-Government
    Bureau, 2009).
  prefs: []

- en: Introduction of a *One World – One Identity* could also hand over the control
    of personal data to the citizens. By sharing the optimum amount of personal data,
    one could minimize the risks of hacks and breaches associated with sensitive data.
    According to Scalar Decisions, individual Canadian organizations face an average
    440 cyberattacks per organization per year, with 3% amounting to a breach (Scalar,
    2019). By confining to a distributed digital identity model, there wouldn’t be
    centralized databases, and organizations would curtail the costs that accompany
    a data breach. At the same time, users would be able to restrict access to the
    pertinent information and avoid the problem of oversharing their personal information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, distributed models assure the consumers, organizations, and service
    providers that the bulk of information is never stored in a single repository,
    rather distributed among decentralized databases. Consumers, without being physically
    present, can share their digital ID with the service provider through a personal
    device, such as a smartphone, and receive appropriate services without jeopardizing
    their privacy.

- en: Another strong advantage of such an identity system is its capability to streamline
    administrative processes, thereby enhancing the productivity of departments and
    services. Subsequently, the system can work on a global level to connect different
    service providers across multiple countries through use of Distributed Ledger
    Technology. Organizations can minimize the time spent on tedious tasks that include
    customer service calls or entering data from the application forms submitted by
    the citizens (Garg, 2022b).

    of digital identities has emerged as one of the foremost concerns on the global
    front. For privacy and security of personal data, decentralized identity may be
    a great solution, and the technology that has risen to the top of the list is
    blockchain. The upcoming chapter discusses how blockchain can syndicate authentication
    technologies with advanced privacy features to provide a robust and frictionless
    identity management.
