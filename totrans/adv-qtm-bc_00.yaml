- en: After the Internet, blockchain is one of the most promising new technologies
    with the potential to radically alter our global society. Blockchain technology
    is being adopted and implemented across the entire spectrum of business and industry
    operations, following the initial phase of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The solutions
    that guarantee trust, transparency, non-repudiation, and redundancy have been
    developed by application developers who have taken advantage of the characteristics
    of the blockchain, such as decentralization, immutability, cryptographic security,
    and so on. Blockchain 3.0 provides a large amount of distributed storage space
    with minimal effort, scalability without compromising security, assistance in
    integrating data from multiple sources without compromising privacy, transparency
    without revealing ownerships, interoperability without excessive complexity, and
    authenticity in provenance. Blockchain's adaptability and multidimensional capability,
    combined with the incorporation of AI, ML, IoT, etc., promises to have a significant,
    positive impact on a wide range of industries and organizations, and opens exciting
    opportunities to deliver a superior value proposition to customers through novel
    products and services.

- en: Digital signatures, hashing algorithms, and public-key cryptography are all
    heavily utilised in blockchain infrastructures to create a one-of-a-kind secure
    and reliable application backbone. Whether it's for digital signatures or encryption,
    the time it takes to solve certain mathematical problems is generally used as
    a yardstick of the strength of the various cryptographic methods currently in
    use. Due to the massive amount of time required relative to the available computational
    power, Blockchain deployments are safe from hacking for any practical purpose.
    The current blockchain encryption systems, however, are vulnerable to the emerging
    quantum computing. The prospect of quantum computer cyber-attacks on the Blockchain
    network is a very real possibility soon, given the rapid pace of progress being
    experienced with quantum computing technology.

- en: Members of the Blockchain community and developers are working on projects to
    strengthen existing distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain networks
    so that they are immune to attacks from quantum computers. These post-quantum
    algorithms are based on computational problems that Shor's algorithm, Grover's
    algorithm, or similar ones have proven to be infeasible for quantum computers.
    Secure computing is achieved through the incorporation of post-quantum cryptography
    in cyber-physical systems, which also opens up new possibilities in fields like
    smart contracts, quantum blockchain, and intelligent security solutions. There
    is a growing consensus that the only way to protect computing and security infrastructure
    from the imminent threat of quantum attacks is to implement quantum-proof cryptography.
    Post-quantum implementations of the Blockchain can be seen in projects like Ethereum
    2.0 and Ethereum 3.0\. Research into quantum Blockchain has attracted a lot of
    attention in recent years thanks to the growth of quantum computation and quantum
    information theory. Although post-quantum cryptography shows great promise in
    many areas, there is surprisingly little written on the subject from an applied
    perspective. For those unfamiliar with distributed ledger technology (DLT) and
    blockchain, this book offers a primer on the topic, as well as an overview of
    the most popular post-quantum algorithms and how they ensure the long-term viability
    of DLT-based applications.

    is due to quantum computing progress and the need for quantum blockchains. Quantum
    blockchain is part of standardized algorithms, frameworks, models, tools, architectures,
    and databases. Quantum information theory and computation research has grown recently.
    This chapter analyses quantum blockchain using the PRISMA technique. Literature

    algorithms depend on the discrete log and factorization problem of large prime
    numbers. Shor's algorithm breaks quantum hash signatures. Post-quantum blockchain
    security requires a quantum-resistant signature scheme or blockchain. This chapter
    discusses the impact quantum computers will have on public key cryptography based
    on quantum computers, public key cryptography, quantum threat to PKI, Shor's and
    Grover's Algorithms, post-quantum cryptography, and quantum-resistant blockchain.

    database for transactions, contracts, and independent records. It's a digital
    ledger accessible on multiple platforms for financial activities and services.
    It's supported by digital currency systems like bitcoin and doesn't rely on third
    parties. Encrypted data can be breached. Blockchain works in the same database
    with multiple shared copies. Blockchain is a new IT subfield. It's a financial
    management tool, technique, and procedure. This chapter covers Blockchain basics,
    issues, and limitations. This chapter describes Blockchain technology in India,
    including opportunities, companies, and manpower availability.

    Most proposed system models use blockchains or machine learning to improve security
    and service quality (QoS). Using a light-weight incremental learning framework,
    the augmented sharding model aids in shard formation and management. The proposed
    model achieves high attack accuracy, low block mining delay, and high throughput.
    This performance improves by 10% in delay and 14% in throughput compared to state-of-the-art
    methods. Sybil, masquerading, and MITM attacks are detected with 99.3% accuracy.
    This text also recommends areas for improving the proposed model's security and
    QoS.

    based on blockchain technology to inculcate environmental protection in the next
    generation. As global economies are driven by markets, we don't value nature's
    free gifts. Until a monetary value is associated with environmental protection,
    it's hard to motivate the next generation to protect it. Green Currency helps
    Bad find a market. Advanced technologies are needed to accept, protect, and maintain
    nature as-is. This chapter introduces Block-Chain-based global green currency.

    has been studied in money, health, and other areas, but gaming remains unconquered.
    This chapter discusses blockchain's use in games. Blockchain creates decentralized,
    copyable computer resources. Blockchain can change gaming in 2 ways. Recently,
    blockchain has impacted our lives. Bitcoin is a common Blockchain term. Interoperability
    is needed for planning and building blockchain apps. Thus, blockchains and existing
    innovations don't mix well. We propose a design to link decentralized advances
    and blockchains. Blockchain gaming is a new distraction.
