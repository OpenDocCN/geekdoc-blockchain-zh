    then explain what has triggered the birth of several cryptocurrencies in our current
    society.  Next, we analyse the theory and the primary focus behind the inventor
    of Bitcoin. Then take a closer look at the possible candidates of the birth father
    of Blockchain in more depth. Next, we briefly analyse what the distributed ledger
    system is, and how it is operated. Followed by the introduction of the miners,
    who they are, and what is their responsibility. Then it moves on to the process
    of how each block gets created, then how they eventually create a chain, which
    we call Blockchain.

    touch on Bitcoin, as there is a myth going around that Bitcoin equals Blockchain.
    Well, that is incorrect. However, it is often referred to as the same thing. Bitcoin
    is cryptocurrency, digitized money, that is allowed and kept alive due to the
    technology called Blockchain.

    on the platform was Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin was the first application on the
    Blockchain technology, one might say that Bitcoin is Blockchain, and that could
    make sense. However, Blockchain is not Bitcoin. I hope that makes sense. Blockchain
    is so complex that, still, there are very few human beings who understand each
    part of it. In fact, Blockchain is so complicated that we (humans) keep on finding
    more and more ideas that this technology can solve every day.

- en: We could say that Blockchain is solving problems. However, for some large Financial
    Organizations, it’s causing certain issues. Some of these matters, of course,

  zh: 我们可以说区块链正在解决问题。然而，对于一些大型金融机构来说，它也带来了一些问题。当然，这些问题正在得到解决，如果你关注新闻，你会发现越来越多的公司开始使用区块链技术来实现许多目的。
- en: The Blockchain is truly revolutionary, as it’s not for solving just one issue
    for some people, but can fix many problems for everyone. It has re-invented the
    financial institution, and the proof of that is simply because Blockchain is running
    and has existed for nine years already, beginning in 2008\. The blockchain is
    a globally distributed database that is completely decentralized, meaning it has
    no boss, or someone that we could blame or award. It is running on all computers,
    and it’s unstoppable. The Blockchain is built up from multiple blocks that are
    un-replaceable. Therefore, it’s chain system represents the single source of truth.
    Once there is a new block created and added to the existing blockchain, it replicates
    itself on its system, which resides on the internet, then just synchronizes the
    same details on all the computers that are running blockchain. This replication
    is what makes it un-replaceable. Therefore, it provides full transparency in all
    administration. Because there is no human intervention in the process of adding
    and further expanding when new blocks are created every 10 minutes, it exhibits
    an efficiency that no person has ever achieved. Because each time a new block
    becomes visible on all computers in the world, it allows full accessibility to
    all human beings.

  zh: 区块链确实是革命性的，因为它不仅仅为某些人解决了一个问题，而是为所有人修复了许多问题。它重新定义了金融机构，证明就是区块链已经在运行，并且已经存在了九年，始于2008年。区块链是一个全球分布式数据库，是完全去中心化的，这意味着它没有老板，或者我们可以责怪或奖励的人。区块链在所有计算机上运行，且不可阻挡。区块链由多个不可替代的区块组成。因此，它的链式系统代表了单一的真实来源。一旦创建新的区块并添加到现有的区块链中，它会在其网络上复制自己，该网络位于互联网上，然后同步所有运行区块链的计算机上的相同详细信息。这种复制使其不可替代。因此，它在所有管理中提供了完全透明度。由于在每10分钟创建新块的过程中没有人为干预，添加和进一步扩展，因此它展现出了前所未有的效率。因为每当新的区块在世界上所有的计算机上变得可见，它允许所有人完全访问。
- en: Where blockchain stands right now, I mean in 2017, is more like where the internet
    was in 1992-1993\. What happened back then is most people said, “it’s nonsense,”
    or “what’s the point of it?” Granted, at the early age of the internet, there
    were only a few personal computers, very few websites, and the network was slow.
    In fact, it was so slow that if you wanted to download a one-page PDF document,
    you would probably go out for lunch, come back and you still had to wait another
    30 minutes. The internet (Interconnected networks) seemed like a dumb idea to
    most people, even for those that had power in politics or others that already
    had existing large retail infrastructure. They believed that it was just background
    noise. Slowly, the internet grew and became bigger and faster. And once local
    support opened on the internet, everything changed. When you think about Blockchain,
    don’t assume that it will not have the same power. Currently, we are innovating
    in large scale and technology grows with such a high speed that no human can keep
    up with it. Blockchain will change that dramatically, so instead of continuing
    to talk about the future, let’s take a step back and understand the history of
    finance.

  zh: 目前区块链所处的位置，我指的是2017年，更像是在1992-1993年期间的互联网。当时发生的事情是，大多数人说：“这是胡说”，“这有什么用？”当然，在互联网的早期阶段，只有少数个人电脑，非常少的网站，而且网络速度很慢。实际上，网速慢到如果你想下载一个一页的PDF文件，你可能得出去吃午饭，回来后还得再等30分钟。对大多数人来说，互联网（互联网络）看起来是个愚蠢的主意，甚至对于那些在政治上有权力或者已经拥有大型零售基础设施的人来说也是如此。他们认为这只是背景噪音。互联网逐渐发展壮大，变得更大、更快。一旦互联网上当地的支特开放，一切都会改变。当你思考区块链时，不要假设它不会有同样的力量。目前，我们在进行大规模创新，技术发展如此之快，以至于没有人能跟上它。区块链将彻底改变这一点，所以，我们不如退一步，先来了解金融的历史。

    Like anything else that has value, it became part of the global trading chain,
    and it was one of the first early paying methods amongst humans in exchange for
    particular goods or services provided. Because food has always helped for basic
    survival, it was one of the best paying methods for an extended period. In fact,
    there are many locations existing in the world that still use this approach at
    present. As civilization has moved on, especially with more developed villages
    and cities, methods of payments have begun to change. Back then we had no freezers,
    or fridges, and using payments such as food items like exotic fruits or any meat
    just went to waste. This caused lots of issues. Therefore, this problem had to
    be resolved. The solution was a new type of payment method, something that wouldn’t
    easily rot or waste. However, had to be exchangeable for food or any other goods
    or services.

  zh: 食品从早期时代起就被确定为人类生存的三大需求之一。因此，我们已经理解到食品具有巨大的价值。像任何有价值的东西一样，它成为了全球贸易链的一部分，并在人类之间以特定商品或服务交换时，成为了最早的支付方式之一。因为食品一直有助于基本生存，所以在一段时间内，这是最好的支付方式之一。实际上，世界上有许多地方至今仍然使用这种方法。随着文明的进步，尤其是在更发达的村庄和城市，支付方式开始发生变化。那时我们没有冰箱，或者冷藏设备，使用像
    exotic fruits 这样的食品支付或者任何肉类都造成了浪费。这造成了诸多问题。因此，这个问题必须得到解决。解决方案是一种新型的支付方式，这种支付方式不会轻易腐烂或浪费。然而，它必须可以与食品或其他任何商品或服务交换。

    form, nearly every country in the world. The new payment method of paper money
    was alive and booming all over the globe. I mean paper money is OK, but we could
    mention countless countries where paper money has failed again and again due to
    its value decrease in long term. The reduction in value of paper money has other
    roots too, such as easily counterfeited in large scale. Additionally, like anything
    else in the world, we have learned that goods with limited supply have an increase
    in value, especially in the long term. However, the opposite happens when paper
    money keeps on getting printed, decreasing in value. When it comes to paper money,
    it’s a fascinating topic.

- en: Anyhow, at the end of 2015, I heard about bitcoin again when I was studying
    about Network Security, so I mentioned it to my friend Rob. He said that, yes,
    he was aware of bitcoin, and it’s worth was like $300\. When Rob said it, I couldn’t
    believe that one bitcoin was worth $300! Of course, I still didn’t understand
    what bitcoin was. I thought that it was like a real physical coin, I still had
    no clue that it only exists in a digital form. Then another friend Viktor, who
    overheard what we were talking about, said that he couldn't believe that I had
    never heard of bitcoin before! So, I said, “Yes, I did hear about it, but I didn’t
    know that it’s worth so much.” I started thinking more and more about it, and
    I began to do some research. A little later, I had an idea to make bitcoin using
    my old laptop! So, I told Viktor and Rob that I heard that computers could generate
    bitcoin, and if it’s worth like $300 each, I might be able to produce one or 2
    every week. Obviously, I had no clue what I was talking about, and they told me
    off that it’s not that easy. However, they couldn’t explain it to me, how it’s
    exactly done. They said that I was thinking like a hacker, and I shouldn’t be
    like that, as it’s for criminals. But I stated that it sounds like an exciting
    technology. They replied, “OK, so why do you need bitcoin? What do you want to
    buy? Do you want to buy something on the dark web?” They made me speechless, so
    I didn’t say anything anymore. However, I secretly begin to learn as much as possible
    about bitcoin and of course that lead me to another interesting technology called
    Blockchain.

    In fact, those days I was working as an Assistant Manager in a restaurant called
    Nando’s. What happened was that people were coming to our restaurant in groups,
    holding boxes containing their belongings from the office. They told us that it
    was the last time they’d be eating there. Because we had been working super hard
    and isolated from the news, we didn’t understand at first what these customers

    UK had gone into administration (bankruptcy) less than 45 minutes ago. We then
    understood and realized that these people who used to have lunch in our restaurant,
    would now not be able to come around anymore. That morning, 2,000 people lost
    their jobs. And the next day, on the 16th of September, another 2,500 more followed.
    We agreed as a management team to provide free soft drinks for those who just
    lost their jobs, to show our sympathy. Of course, we lost all those customers
    too and many more. Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience that I encountered
    right at the beginning of the recession in 2008\. Following the Lehman Brothers,
    there were many more Banks and Financial Institutions that had no choice but to
    choose administration. For months, every news channel was full of the latest stories
    that another large company had lost all its assets, again and again. At the same
    time, unemployment began to rise, then slowly, lots of people started losing their
    homes due to uncompleted payments.

    no wonder it received an Oscar, even though it might have deserved more than that,
    but that’s just my opinion. When I think about this sci-fi movie, I am thinking
    about the fact that it is very similar to the same concepts. We have received
    a technology called Blockchain from an unknown person—or I should say from an
    anonymous source—that will change our world dramatically! I wonder how the film
    creators came across the idea… I am not suggesting that there are Aliens out there,

    you have physical access to it. Such might be a laptop or desktop computer that
    can be broken into using a Linux cd, and booted using that. If you want to go
    further, let’s take banks, for example. They are getting compromised all the time;
    of course, they have stopped announcing these types of incidents, as they would
    have no customers left if they would carry on doing so. The director of the FBI
    was hacked by a teenager in the end of 2015, and most people think it’s funny.
    Still, when you think about the security within the FBI, it is very well organized,
    yet still hackable. The FBI might not be the best example to mention, as even
    Kevin Mitnick hacked the FBI for three long years, and listened to the agents’
    phone conversations, talking about himself. When you look at the NSA, aka The
    National Security Agency, you probably have heard of Edward Snowden already, who
    walked out with documents that are considered to be secret; that still shows that
    even the NSA has weaknesses. And confidential, or even secret, documents can be
    leaked. All those expensive Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems, or Intrusion
    Detection Systems are worthless if they are not upgraded correctly. Also, you
    have to understand that having all that security does not mean anything if someone
    has a social engineering skill set and figures out the password to any of those
    devices. The result would be dramatic, and they always are, but most of the great
    financial institutions have stopped talking to news channels about being compromised

    platform named bitcoin. Bitcoin is blockchain. However, Bitcoin itself, is only
    a cryptocurrency that is capable of replacing fiat currencies. Nevertheless, not
    that many people will like the idea at first. Blockchain has solved the problem
    that we have always faced, that is trust. Using blockchain technology enables
    us to avoid trusting third party services. Therefore, any payment or exchange
    over the internet will be between 2 parties only. This is revolutionary as we
    can expand the trust gap, and the market of the future not only will be faster
    and cheaper, but will have no limitations, such as age, race, sex, occupation,
    nationality, or anything like that.

    will focus in depth on the knowledge and nitty gritty details that people don’t
    like to talk about. As with every existing technology, when it comes to blockchain,
    it is also true that there are only a select few individuals who are interested
    in how things work. Therefore, I would like to congratulate you on deciding to
    take your interest to the next level. Most people are only interested in listening
    to music, they never learn how the CD player works. Of course, there are new ways
    of listening to music or audiobooks. Still, this is one of my all-time favorite
    examples that I have always used throughout the years when I'm just about to explain
    something to someone who isn't interested in what I am about to say.

    how the music is transferred wirelessly, using Bluetooth technology, to your speakers
    that provide you with your favorite tunes. This is fine; however, each time you
    learn a new word you are creating an additional brain cell, leading to you increasing
    your IQ, and in turn, you become more intelligent. Furthermore, you will decrease
    your chances of losing all your brain cells. It has been researched that once
    an average human being turns 30-40 years old, brain cells begin to die, literally
    keep disappearing, and there is not much you can do about it. Each decade an average
    human loses between 5-10% of his brain capacity; of course, it depends on many
    circumstances. But, the overall average is 7%. Brain cells will die—no matter
    what. However, what you can do is to keep on creating additional brain cells by
    learning new words and new skills, really anything that is new to your brain.
    It has also been researched that learning a new language can help you grow your
    IQ, creating a tremendous amount of new brain cells.

- en: Every single device that is connected to the internet, and running blockchain, 
    becomes part of the network. This way all those devices can communicate with each
    other using the internet, and keep on updating each other. Because there is no
    master node or a centralized machine that has a different purpose than the rest
    of them, this network is called peer-peer network. Peer to peer networks have
    existed for a long time. Therefore, there is nothing new about it. However, because
    it has no master node of any kind, this is not a centralized network, but a decentralized
    P2P network. This is very important, as it tells you that there is no boss of
    any kind; so, it decreases the possibility that one or more nodes on the network
    might be able to manipulate the rest of the nodes. Manipulation of any kind is
    simply impossibly, and that, in itself, is proof we can trust the system. This
    is not all, of course, but the network itself is solely based on a technology
    that’s existed previously; however, this time it has a different purpose. What
    you have to understand is that when it comes to a peer-to-peer network, there
    is no central server or central client. In traditional centralized networks, there
    is the primary server, or central servers, and multiple clients; and the way they
    are connected is that the servers are always dictating what the clients can have.
    Peer-to-peer networks, on the other hand, are completely different, as all nodes
    on the network serve both purposes, they are all servers as well as clients. Meaning,
    no one machine can have a bigger decision power than any other on the same network.
    Therefore, P2P networks are always working together, making decisions together,
    and equally distributing those to all nodes on the network.

  zh: 每一个连接到互联网并运行区块链的设备都成为网络的一部分。这样，所有这些设备都可以使用互联网相互通信，并不断更新彼此。由于没有主节点或中心化机器，其目的与其它设备不同，因此这个网络被称为对等网络。对等网络已经存在很长时间了。因此，这并不是什么新鲜事。然而，由于它没有任何类型的主节点，这并不是一个中心化网络，而是一个去中心化的P2P网络。这非常重要，因为它告诉你没有任何类型的老板；所以，它降低了网络上一个或多个节点可能能够操纵其他节点的可能性。任何类型的操纵都是完全不可能的，这本身就是我们信任这个系统的证据。当然，这还不是全部，但网络本身完全基于之前已经存在的技术；然而，这次它的目的不同。你需要理解的是，当涉及到对等网络时，网络上没有中心服务器或中心客户端。在传统的中心化网络中，有主要服务器或中心服务器，以及多个客户端；它们连接的方式是服务器总是决定客户端可以拥有什么。另一方面，对等网络完全不同，因为网络上的所有节点都具有双重目的，它们既是服务器也是客户端。这意味着，没有一台机器可以比网络上任何其他机器拥有更大的决策权。因此，P2P网络总是共同工作，共同做出决策，并平等地将这些决策分布给网络上的所有节点。
- en: 'Another problem with centralized networks is that if one node is ready to share
    the latest news with the rest of the network, first it would have to send the
    traffic to the master node or server, which then would be able to do many things.
    The server could manipulate the traffic before forwarding to any other node. Managing
    the traffic would be easy on the server node, as once the server would receive
    the traffic from client A, the server would not send the same traffic back to
    client A (as that was the source in the first place). Instead, the server would
    send the traffic to the rest of the clients, but if this trade would be manipulated
    already, neither the remainder of the nodes or client A would never find out about
    it. Another issue would also be if the server would decide to send the traffic
    only for a particular group of clients, instead of all of them. Again, this could
    reduce the power of an extensive peer-to-peer network, and in the case of the
    blockchain, this would not be an advantage. The worse that could happen in a centralized
    network is this: once the server would receive traffic for the sake of conversation,
    data about the latest confirmed block, imagine that the server would decide not
    to share this data with any other client. This would just put the blockchain out
    of business. Therefore, the only way that the system would operate is to use a
    decentralized P2P network. In case you wonder how the server would make such a
    decision itself, well, it would not. Even though administering a server, or a
    small group of servers, may be straightforward for a person; when it comes to
    a P2P network, a person with evil intentions, like hacking purposes, or traffic
    manipulations, would have a hard time to do so and the reason is straightforward.
    Administering a large group of machines manually that reside all over the internet
    is nearly impossible. This is the reason why if you want to open a company, and
    you want to be the boss, you would create a traditional centralized network by
    having a master node that you can administer anytime you want. Again, P2P networks
    have no boss. Therefore, there is no one to blame, and every machine on the network
    shares the same responsibility.'

  zh: 中心化网络的另一个问题是，如果一个节点准备与网络中的其他节点分享最新消息，首先它必须将流量发送到主节点或服务器，然后服务器能够执行许多操作。服务器可以在将流量转发给任何其他节点之前操纵流量。在服务器节点上管理流量会很容易，因为一旦服务器从客户端A接收到流量，服务器就不会将相同的流量发送回客户端A（因为那是原始来源）。相反，服务器会将流量发送给其他所有客户端，但如果这种交易已经被操纵了，节点剩余部分或客户端A都永远不会发现。另一个问题是，如果服务器决定只将流量发送给特定的一组客户端，而不是所有客户端。同样，这会减少广泛的对等网络的力量，在区块链的情况下，这不会是一个优势。在中心化网络中可能发生的最糟糕的事情是：一旦服务器为了对话而接收到流量，关于最新确认区块的数据，想象一下服务器决定不将此数据与任何其他客户端共享。这将使区块链业务陷入停顿。因此，唯一使系统运行的方法是使用去中心化的P2P网络。如果您想知道服务器如何自己做出这样的决定，嗯，它不会。尽管对于一个人来说，管理一个服务器或一组服务器可能很简单；但当涉及到P2P网络时，一个有恶意意图的人，比如黑客目的或流量操纵，将很难做到，原因很明确。手动管理位于互联网上各个角落的大量机器几乎是不可能的。这就是为什么如果您想开一家公司，并且您想成为老板，您会通过拥有一个可以随时管理的
    主节点来创建一个传统的中心化网络。再次，P2P网络没有老板。因此，没有责怪的对象，网络上的每台机器都承担着同样的责任。

    systems are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data; for example,
    images or audio, that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed
    to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without
    modification and any alteration during transport. Base-64 encoding schemes use
    both capital A-Z, lower case a-z letters as well 0-9 numbers for the first 62
    values, and the symbols of + (plus), / (slash).

    of bytes to encode is not divisible by 3, and there are only 1 or 2 bytes of input
    for the last 24-bit block then extra bytes with value zero are added, so there
    are always three bytes.

    are set up in every 17 seconds on average. The block height is the sum of the
    blocks in a chain between it and the genesis block minus 1\. Blocks on side forks
    can have the same block height as blocks on the main chain. Particular nodes on
    the peer-to-peer network are creating these blocks. These nodes are called miners.
    All the miners are collecting every transaction that people are sending to each
    other over the network, and only valid transactions are relayed to the other nodes.
    Each miner takes a number of these collected operations and puts them in a newly
    formed block. These lists of transactions are numbered tx0, tx1, tx2, … and so
    on. Tx stands for transaction, followed by the number. The first transaction (tx0)
    is also known as the coinbase transaction. This is the transaction where the miner
    assigns a block reward to his address. This is how Bitcoins are created. For Bitcoin
    miners, as of now in 2017, the block reward is 12.5 Bitcoins; however, back in
    the day of the genesis block, the reward was 50 bitcoins for each block creation.
    For Bitcoin, the block reward is halved after every 210,000 blocks. Once there
    have been 64 halvings, the block reward will be zero. There will be a maximum
    number of 21 million Bitcoin in circulation in the year of 2140\. Other Bitcoin
    transactions, such as tx1 or tx2, are the ordinary transaction where the bitcoins
    are transferred from the owner address to a recipient address. Each transaction
    requires a small transaction fee. This fee will continue to increase as an incentive
    for the miners to create new blocks because the block reward will continue to

    the main chain because it consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis

    The crypto coins mined on the testnet, also known as testnet coins, have no real
    value. A testnet offers developers a sandbox environment to experiment without
    having to use the actual crypto coins or worrying about breaking the main chain.
    The main chain is also called, the mainnet. In case you we’re wondering about
    mining bitcoin, this is it. You can quickly mine your own Bitcoin or Ethereum
    testnet coins by setting up your own Bitcoin or Ethereum node.

    to find solutions easier for solving hash puzzles—as well—getting a block reward.
    The mainnet and testnet are two individual networks, and there is no availability
    to send coins from one platform to another neither vice versa. To work on the
    Bitcoin testnet, you need to generate a differently formatted testnet Bitcoin
    address. A Bitcoin testnet address always begins with the letter m or n. The Bitcoin
    testnet address does not work on the mainnet.

    its technical details can be very confusing for some; therefore, I will try to
    explain simplistically before really diving into it.

    within the blocks. I am a network engineer, and it’s easy to say, that when it
    comes to a decision of making a change, especially within the production environment,
    it is because there is an issue that needs to be addressed. The problem currently
    with the blocks is simple. Each block can handle 1MB of data, meaning all transaction
    details.
  id: totrans-741
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once there is enough data within a block, the block gets sealed, and miners
    start to create another new block. The issue that needs to be addressed is that
    each block gets filled with some data, but indeed it has been identified that
    there should be more data within each block. I have explained previously that
    each block contains lots of data, in fact, every transaction details are recorded
    on the blockchain, specifically, within the blocks. Data such recorded are the
    block number, destination address, source address, transaction value, hashing
    algorithms, and so on; however, one of the most important data recorded, is the
    actual script that contains the digital signatures as well the public keys. To
    have a block validated on the blockchain peer-to-peer network, these parts of
    the blockchain rules had to be within the script. However, it has been identified
    that the current situation is slowing down the system, and an upgrade is required.
    This scaling issue needed to be addressed; therefore, blockchain developers came
    up with an idea.

- en: 'The solution is called SegWit. However, the real plan to implement SegWit is
    to remove the script from the blocks, making the blocks lighter; therefore, leaving
    more space for additional transactions, as well, speed up the system. However,
    the proposal has a possible side effect. The reality is that the script is still
    going to be required as the rules of the blockchain cannot be changed, therefore,
    part of the proposal is that there will also be an extended block that will have
    the script. This is of course very confusing for many, especially for those who
    have no technical background. The other problem is that developers are not sure
    if it''s going to work out ok or not: even though they believe it is needed, hence
    the change proposal in the first place. Still, we only can find out once implemented.
    This solution is a solution for many other issues too. One is that each transaction
    fee is very cheap; however, it could be even less expensive. What you have to
    understand is that bitcoin is an excellent digital currency when it comes to values
    such as $100 worth or more. However, in order to implement it worldwide in every
    store, it requires some upgrades.'

    could be just too expensive. So, what has been identified is this: If we could
    add more transactions to each block, like twice as much, that could mean that
    each transaction would cost half of what it is now. However, in order to fit more
    transactions to a block, something has to be removed. What has been discovered,
    is that the script can be re-written and added to an extended block on the original
    block, and this would be called Segregated Witness aka SegWit.'

    used are also witnessing the proofs. Separating the signatures from both the transaction
    data structure and the block data structure into their data structure. Taking
    the signatures out of the transaction data structure is the main reason; however,
    there are some side effects, so let’s take a look at them. First, side effects
    are not always bad, in fact, regards to SegWit, there are some very positive outcomes
    possible.

    that is not static within the transaction data is the digital signature. To be
    fair, everything else is covered by the signature, therefore, cannot be changed
    effectively, unless invalidating the signature; however, the signature itself
    can be malleated. So, once the signature would be taken out of the transaction
    data, the transaction ID would not be based on the signature anymore.
  id: totrans-748

    transaction ID cannot be malleated. This, in itself, is a massive development,

    have with transaction malleability.

    systems, where you can make unauthorized changes to transactions and re-broadcast
    with a different transaction ID. You cannot change where the funds are coming
    from, neither where the funds are going, because the signature covers that; however,
    you can make small modifications to the signature.
  id: totrans-751
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s think of this in simple terms. Let's say that the signature contained
    the number 5\. The analysis of the algorithm 5, and 05 are the same, but if you
    pad a number in a certain way, it will change the fingerprint of that transaction,
    even if that signature is interpreted the same way. Therefore, you can modify
    part of the signature because they are not covered by the signature and they would
    produce a transaction with an entirely different ID. By doing that, you can jam
    it into the network and cause confusion. Transaction malleability has been blamed
    for some thefts and Bitcoin exchanges, where people mostly are getting a form
    of double withdraw, using transaction malleability. It also allows you to carry
    out a DOS – Denial of Service Attack, against the network; as well, against the
    people who are using payment channels or chaining many transactions together.

  id: totrans-753
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of the interesting side effects of SegWit is that you can start counting
    block sizes differently and give some capacity to increase directly through the
    SegWit. Transactions are the key to opening the door to get into the blockchain;
    therefore, you need a signature on the transaction to be validated to the blockchain.
    However, once the transaction is in the blockchain, nobody checks those signatures
    ever again; typically we do not go back to see old transactions that happened
    a long time ago. They’re only buried within the blockchain. They have been validated:
    therefore, old transactions are already trusted. The signature is only used once
    for validation. For example, when you write a paper check, you have the option
    to go to your online banking system and look at the image of the check after it
    has been submitted and cashed. It''s not part of the bank statement, and you don’t
    need it for anything other than to check it once to see that it was validated;
    after, it''s only hanging around, no need for it anymore. Same thing applies to
    signatures. What you have to understand is that digital signatures take 75% of
    the total space of some transactions. Additionally, the more transactions there
    are, the bigger the signature gets. Large complex scripts and multi signatures
    have huge signatures, and they take up a lot of space on the blockchain, and,
    again, nobody ever cares about them once they have been validated.'

    malleability and removing transaction signatures from the transaction data is
    something that requires considering the whole network, and it’s been assumed that
    it needs a hard fork. However, there is a way to proceed using soft fork instead
    of hard fork. Indeed, it’s a fascinating trick. This method allows you to put
    a version number in front of the Bitcoin script. What that does, is allows you
    to upgrade the version number of the script, while old clients cannot see the
    difference, but still able to validate transactions entirely. Former customers
    can continue to operate without upgrading, and all that is different is that they
    are endorsing a little less they used to do before. Additionally, new clients
    can upgrade scripts. Once you have a new version of a script (this is awesome)
    as you can introduce endless amounts of soft forks parallel to change all kinds
    of scripting mechanisms. This trick is not only good to use for SegWit, but all
    other kinds of new developments. This is accelerating the innovation in the scripting
    language. Altogether these aspects: Segregated witness, Transaction malleability,
    increasing the capacity of the block by removing lots of information that’s not
    used after validation, and the same time upgrading version scripts—make a truly
    compelling feature and resolve lots of problems.'

    once 95% of the blocks have the bits set than that feature is forced for validation.

    terms, let me provide an example for better understanding. Imagine that you want

    the current version of Microsoft Word. This is what backward compatibility is,
    meaning it recognizes old formats.

    from 1998 that has not been upgraded would still open a document that we use today,
    or at least in a certain way. It may not be able to see all original details correctly,
    and may not be able to understand some of the features; however, it still would
    be able to open the document. Therefore, soft forks have forward compatibility,
    meaning that clients who have not yet upgraded to the new code will not break
    and won’t stop validating so they can still maintain validating on the current
    consensus chain. All there is, is that they are validating less information because
    they may not be able to see the new features; however, they can ignore them while
    validating.

    before, any change to the system apparently will cause effects. Soft forks, hard
    forks, they all have bugs, even though all these features are always tested on
    Testnet. For example, segregated witness testnet had been running for months before
    implementation, and that allows to have more faith before any change. Miners have
    become very concerned about any change and making sure there are multiple tests
    before any implementation takes place. The general belief is that soft forks are
    less dangerous than hard forks, but the problem that some people identify is that
    they do not force the network to upgrade, meaning you can end up with lots of
    old clients that validate less transactions. However, some other developers prefer
    to have more of a strict approach, and just believe that if you don’t upgrade,
    you should be off the network. Therefore, it’s more like a philosophical issue
    rather than technical.

    say that blockchain itself isn’t capable of anything. However, software developers,
    security experts, large financial institutions, FinTech start-ups, and banks,
    already have paid a keen interest, as well as have begun to invest and create

    technology firms, are already all over the blockchain and its little intricacies.
    Therefore, the days are counting to reach the big bang of the transformation,
    the technology of the future, or, I should say, the next internet!

    this is an advanced guide, and some instances were just impossible to do so. My
    upcoming book on Bitcoin will provide more details on how to invest in digital
    gold safely and securely.
