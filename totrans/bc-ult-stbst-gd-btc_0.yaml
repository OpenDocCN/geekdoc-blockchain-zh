    Blockchain. The contents avoid technical details to provide a better understanding
    to those who are new to this technology. There are certain terms that some technical
    background in Information Technology would help. However, it’s not necessary.
    Everyday English has been used through this book to avoid confusion, and this
    book will take you by the hand and show you, step-by-step, how digital currency
    was born.

    then explain what has triggered the birth of several cryptocurrencies in our current
    society.  Next, we analyse the theory and the primary focus behind the inventor
    of Bitcoin. Then take a closer look at the possible candidates of the birth father
    of Blockchain in more depth. Next, we briefly analyse what the distributed ledger
    system is, and how it is operated. Followed by the introduction of the miners,
    who they are, and what is their responsibility. Then it moves on to the process
    of how each block gets created, then how they eventually create a chain, which
    we call Blockchain.

    touch on Bitcoin, as there is a myth going around that Bitcoin equals Blockchain.
    Well, that is incorrect. However, it is often referred to as the same thing. Bitcoin
    is cryptocurrency, digitized money, that is allowed and kept alive due to the
    technology called Blockchain.

    on the platform was Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin was the first application on the
    Blockchain technology, one might say that Bitcoin is Blockchain, and that could
    make sense. However, Blockchain is not Bitcoin. I hope that makes sense. Blockchain
    is so complex that, still, there are very few human beings who understand each
    part of it. In fact, Blockchain is so complicated that we (humans) keep on finding
    more and more ideas that this technology can solve every day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could say that Blockchain is solving problems. However, for some large Financial
    Organizations, it’s causing certain issues. Some of these matters, of course,
    are getting addressed and if you keep up with the news, you realize that more
    and more companies are beginning to use Blockchain Technology for many purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Blockchain is truly revolutionary, as it’s not for solving just one issue
    for some people, but can fix many problems for everyone. It has re-invented the
    financial institution, and the proof of that is simply because Blockchain is running
    and has existed for nine years already, beginning in 2008\. The blockchain is
    a globally distributed database that is completely decentralized, meaning it has
    no boss, or someone that we could blame or award. It is running on all computers,
    and it’s unstoppable. The Blockchain is built up from multiple blocks that are
    un-replaceable. Therefore, it’s chain system represents the single source of truth.
    Once there is a new block created and added to the existing blockchain, it replicates
    itself on its system, which resides on the internet, then just synchronizes the
    same details on all the computers that are running blockchain. This replication
    is what makes it un-replaceable. Therefore, it provides full transparency in all
    administration. Because there is no human intervention in the process of adding
    and further expanding when new blocks are created every 10 minutes, it exhibits
    an efficiency that no person has ever achieved. Because each time a new block
    becomes visible on all computers in the world, it allows full accessibility to
    all human beings.
  prefs: []

- en: Where blockchain stands right now, I mean in 2017, is more like where the internet
    was in 1992-1993\. What happened back then is most people said, “it’s nonsense,”
    or “what’s the point of it?” Granted, at the early age of the internet, there
    were only a few personal computers, very few websites, and the network was slow.
    In fact, it was so slow that if you wanted to download a one-page PDF document,
    you would probably go out for lunch, come back and you still had to wait another
    30 minutes. The internet (Interconnected networks) seemed like a dumb idea to
    most people, even for those that had power in politics or others that already
    had existing large retail infrastructure. They believed that it was just background
    noise. Slowly, the internet grew and became bigger and faster. And once local
    support opened on the internet, everything changed. When you think about Blockchain,
    don’t assume that it will not have the same power. Currently, we are innovating
    in large scale and technology grows with such a high speed that no human can keep
    up with it. Blockchain will change that dramatically, so instead of continuing
    to talk about the future, let’s take a step back and understand the history of
    finance.

- en: Food items have been identified since the early ages as one of the primary human
    needs for survival. Therefore, we have understood that food has tremendous value.
    Like anything else that has value, it became part of the global trading chain,
    and it was one of the first early paying methods amongst humans in exchange for
    particular goods or services provided. Because food has always helped for basic
    survival, it was one of the best paying methods for an extended period. In fact,
    there are many locations existing in the world that still use this approach at
    present. As civilization has moved on, especially with more developed villages
    and cities, methods of payments have begun to change. Back then we had no freezers,
    or fridges, and using payments such as food items like exotic fruits or any meat
    just went to waste. This caused lots of issues. Therefore, this problem had to
    be resolved. The solution was a new type of payment method, something that wouldn’t
    easily rot or waste. However, had to be exchangeable for food or any other goods
    or services.

    at the silver or gold value, they are continuously increasing. Humans have realized
    that it is getting much harder to mine gold and silver. Therefore, precious metal

    with change and we are hesitant to adapt to anything that we don’t understand–at
    least at first. After a while, all sorts of paper money was implemented in a centralized
    form, nearly every country in the world. The new payment method of paper money
    was alive and booming all over the globe. I mean paper money is OK, but we could
    mention countless countries where paper money has failed again and again due to
    its value decrease in long term. The reduction in value of paper money has other
    roots too, such as easily counterfeited in large scale. Additionally, like anything
    else in the world, we have learned that goods with limited supply have an increase
    in value, especially in the long term. However, the opposite happens when paper
    money keeps on getting printed, decreasing in value. When it comes to paper money,
    it’s a fascinating topic.

    very fast. When you are looking at an international bank transaction it might
    take 3-5 days, but you can do this using your laptop at your home or your mobile
    device, anywhere. However, at first–when it was introduced–it seemed alien and
    most people didn’t believe that it would ever work. Slowly, we have learned that
    certain payments can be automated: such as paying your bills or a service that
    you have subscribed, and of course, most large companies are now paying all their
    employees through bank transfers. Well, there are still many companies who pay
    their employees cash in hand, as they don’t wish to pay taxes. These companies
    choose to remain anonymous instead of sharing with the banks all their assets,
    for various reasons. As always, people had to adapt. The idea that all your wealth

    the more you will find ugly services. And I am sorry to mention these, but the
    things I have seen are disgusting, and for those who can be easily upset, I would
    not recommend it at all. My point is, that the guns and drugs traders on Tor ask
    for payment in the form of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is untraceable, as well as the TOR
    network. Therefore, the Dark Web is a haven for criminals.

    people are left with empty wallets. Please don’t misunderstand this point. It’s
    not the bitcoin that is hacked, but the end-user level victim’s Computers, or
    mobile devices. The value of bitcoin has become enormous; and hackers do educate
    themselves too. Therefore, they have changed their game once again, and realized
    that hacking Bitcoin accounts is profitable and untraceable; so, why not do it—especially
    do it on a grand scale? This issue has been addressed, and if you decide to own
    a wallet, you must make sure that you always back up your wallet, as well, always
    have all the security features enabled. Some of these security features are like
    2-step authentications that don’t require much learning or time, still, better
    to be secured then assuming that hackers will never find you.

    about Network Security, so I mentioned it to my friend Rob. He said that, yes,
    he was aware of bitcoin, and it’s worth was like $300\. When Rob said it, I couldn’t
    believe that one bitcoin was worth $300! Of course, I still didn’t understand
    what bitcoin was. I thought that it was like a real physical coin, I still had
    no clue that it only exists in a digital form. Then another friend Viktor, who
    overheard what we were talking about, said that he couldn't believe that I had
    never heard of bitcoin before! So, I said, “Yes, I did hear about it, but I didn’t
    know that it’s worth so much.” I started thinking more and more about it, and
    I began to do some research. A little later, I had an idea to make bitcoin using
    my old laptop! So, I told Viktor and Rob that I heard that computers could generate
    bitcoin, and if it’s worth like $300 each, I might be able to produce one or 2
    every week. Obviously, I had no clue what I was talking about, and they told me
    off that it’s not that easy. However, they couldn’t explain it to me, how it’s
    exactly done. They said that I was thinking like a hacker, and I shouldn’t be
    like that, as it’s for criminals. But I stated that it sounds like an exciting
    technology. They replied, “OK, so why do you need bitcoin? What do you want to
    buy? Do you want to buy something on the dark web?” They made me speechless, so
    I didn’t say anything anymore. However, I secretly begin to learn as much as possible
    about bitcoin and of course that lead me to another interesting technology called
    Blockchain.

    In fact, those days I was working as an Assistant Manager in a restaurant called

    holding boxes containing their belongings from the office. They told us that it
    was the last time they’d be eating there. Because we had been working super hard

    would now not be able to come around anymore. That morning, 2,000 people lost
    their jobs. And the next day, on the 16th of September, another 2,500 more followed.
    We agreed as a management team to provide free soft drinks for those who just
    lost their jobs, to show our sympathy. Of course, we lost all those customers
    too and many more. Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience that I encountered
    right at the beginning of the recession in 2008\. Following the Lehman Brothers,
    there were many more Banks and Financial Institutions that had no choice but to
    choose administration. For months, every news channel was full of the latest stories
    that another large company had lost all its assets, again and again. At the same
    time, unemployment began to rise, then slowly, lots of people started losing their
    homes due to uncompleted payments.

    we couldn’t figure out who Satoshi Nakamoto is in the past decade; not where he

    price is high, the bitcoin would probably fluctuate.

    instead of people’s names, the huge ledger system holds information about payment
    value and addresses. In regards to the amount values, the ledger holds all the
    records of payments back to the first transaction that was ever made. In regard
    to the addresses, there are no URL’s or location addresses. Instead, these are
    bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, addresses. The ledger holds a series of
    transactions of all cryptocurrencies.

    One part of the ledger is representing the value that has been assigned, some
    other parts of the ledger represent the date and time of each transaction. This
    is very similar to any of the current Banking systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see who transferred to what account, what date and time, as well how
    much was each transaction; however, the ledger has no banker. Also, the addresses
    are not representing names of the individuals, neither who holds what amount;
    therefore, you can call this an anonymous ledger system. What you have to understand
    is that when it comes to an individual’s bank account who has no relatives, the
    bank could seize that account. In addition to banks, even the Police, FBI, or
    any government official can take any bank account if they find a possible reason
    for it. When it comes to a bitcoin account within the great ledger, the only person
    who can access it is the person who has the password to that account.

    wallet that the ledger holds, whatever value it has will be lost forever. With
    your bank account, if you lose your password, you call the bank, they ask security
    questions, and once you prove that you are the owner of that account, the bank
    will provide you access. On the other hand, having a bitcoin account, no bank
    will be able to help you to access your account. The ledger is visible to anyone,
    as it’s completely de-centralized. Therefore, everyone can see your bitcoin account,
    as well how much value that wallet has. However, no one can tell that account
    is connected to you.

    and goes into a block; then each block will join to the previously validated blocks,
    then eventually they all will form a chain of blocks, that we call blockchain.

    block that gets created by the system, every blockchain member receives a finalized
    sealed block.

    citizen. This is how blockchain holds every transaction and every value that was

    without any central authority. If all that sounds alien to you, just understand
    that is completely automated by the system, and you, as a bitcoin citizen, do
    not need to do any calculation, and it would probably take a very long time anyways.

    carried out by the miners. When a new validated block arrives, each new block
    must be added to every citizen’s blockchain; however, before accepting the new
    block, everyone checks the logical continuation of all the values in the new block,
    to make sure that all the transfers of costs are legitimate. This also prevents
    any replication of transfers or any counterfeiting done by hackers, or people
    with bad intentions, trying to steal bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. This
    is a crucial step, as this validation will remain within the great ledger and
    within the blockchain forever. This process uses hashes for competition, to validate
    each block, and make sure that each citizen receives the same record.

    a new block that is accepted by the citizens, the record of the transaction cannot
    be modified, making it permanent information. This will also become irreversible.
    Therefore, no one can ever challenge it or change it, in the future.

    software to speed up the authentication process. However, it doesn’t matter what
    software they use, as all of their work will be checked. It starts when a miner

    Detection Systems are worthless if they are not upgraded correctly. Also, you
    have to understand that having all that security does not mean anything if someone
    has a social engineering skill set and figures out the password to any of those
    devices. The result would be dramatic, and they always are, but most of the great
    financial institutions have stopped talking to news channels about being compromised
    by hackers, as it would only damage their image, and it would become an embarrassment.

    a specific organization to compromise its systems; that is why hackers know for
    a fact that anything can be broken into. To hack into any system, it’s only a
    matter of time and proper planning; however, when it comes to a system like blockchain,
    it is highly unlikely. Although experts say that it is not impossible, it still
    would require an enormous amount of computing power. Blockchain has no firewalls
    or any Detection or Prevention system that would protect it. Instead, blockchain’s
    power comes from the fact that it is completely decentralized. What I mean by
    that is simple really. However, I will do my best to explain it in everyday English.

    You may choose not to ever buy bitcoins, or invest in any cryptocurrency. However,
    you might become part of the blockchain community by running a software called
    blockchain. The software itself is free to download and use, and you will have
    no obligation to anyone whatsoever, but once you decide to run it, you simply
    become part of the blockchain community. Once you become such member, your device
    will become part of the blockchain and each time a new block is created your device
    will also get a copy of that transaction.

    that should be hacked to compromise the block chain thoroughly. Because your device
    is now running a blockchain software, it’s now also contributing to the existing
    decentralized system. There are no centralized copies and every user is trusted
    in the same way as the rest of them. What I mean is that no master node exists,
    as every single device has the same replicated information, making it nearly impossible
    to hack. The blockchain is running for almost a decade, and it has never been
    compromised, not once. It is fascinating, as the blockchain has a bounty of 7
    Billion dollars to anyone who can compromise the system, offered anonymously.
    Due to the price on blockchain’s head, it has become the primary target for many
    black hat hackers, as well as large criminal organizations, and Cybergangs, for
    years.

    but, as I mentioned before, anything can be hacked, as it’s only a matter of time.
    IT professionals always believe that with technology expanding rapidly, in the
    future, anything is possible. Quantum technology defines the way how the blockchain
    system can be hacked. However, it would require hacking the million-plus machines
    currently running the blockchain software. Additionally, to actually hack all
    those devices, it would need to be implemented extremely quickly to be successful.

    a cryptocurrency that is capable of replacing fiat currencies. Nevertheless, not
    that many people will like the idea at first. Blockchain has solved the problem
    that we have always faced, that is trust. Using blockchain technology enables
    us to avoid trusting third party services. Therefore, any payment or exchange
    over the internet will be between 2 parties only. This is revolutionary as we

    will focus in depth on the knowledge and nitty gritty details that people don’t
    like to talk about. As with every existing technology, when it comes to blockchain,
    it is also true that there are only a select few individuals who are interested
    in how things work. Therefore, I would like to congratulate you on deciding to
    take your interest to the next level. Most people are only interested in listening
    to music, they never learn how the CD player works. Of course, there are new ways
    of listening to music or audiobooks. Still, this is one of my all-time favorite
    examples that I have always used throughout the years when I'm just about to explain
    something to someone who isn't interested in what I am about to say.

    how the music is transferred wirelessly, using Bluetooth technology, to your speakers
    that provide you with your favorite tunes. This is fine; however, each time you
    learn a new word you are creating an additional brain cell, leading to you increasing
    your IQ, and in turn, you become more intelligent. Furthermore, you will decrease
    your chances of losing all your brain cells. It has been researched that once
    an average human being turns 30-40 years old, brain cells begin to die, literally
    keep disappearing, and there is not much you can do about it. Each decade an average
    human loses between 5-10% of his brain capacity; of course, it depends on many
    circumstances. But, the overall average is 7%. Brain cells will die—no matter
    what. However, what you can do is to keep on creating additional brain cells by
    learning new words and new skills, really anything that is new to your brain.
    It has also been researched that learning a new language can help you grow your
    IQ, creating a tremendous amount of new brain cells.

    becomes part of the network. This way all those devices can communicate with each
    other using the internet, and keep on updating each other. Because there is no
    master node or a centralized machine that has a different purpose than the rest
    of them, this network is called peer-peer network. Peer to peer networks have
    existed for a long time. Therefore, there is nothing new about it. However, because
    it has no master node of any kind, this is not a centralized network, but a decentralized
    P2P network. This is very important, as it tells you that there is no boss of
    any kind; so, it decreases the possibility that one or more nodes on the network
    might be able to manipulate the rest of the nodes. Manipulation of any kind is
    simply impossibly, and that, in itself, is proof we can trust the system. This
    is not all, of course, but the network itself is solely based on a technology
    that’s existed previously; however, this time it has a different purpose. What
    you have to understand is that when it comes to a peer-to-peer network, there
    is no central server or central client. In traditional centralized networks, there
    is the primary server, or central servers, and multiple clients; and the way they
    are connected is that the servers are always dictating what the clients can have.
    Peer-to-peer networks, on the other hand, are completely different, as all nodes
    on the network serve both purposes, they are all servers as well as clients. Meaning,
    no one machine can have a bigger decision power than any other on the same network.
    Therefore, P2P networks are always working together, making decisions together,
    and equally distributing those to all nodes on the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another problem with centralized networks is that if one node is ready to share
    the latest news with the rest of the network, first it would have to send the
    traffic to the master node or server, which then would be able to do many things.
    The server could manipulate the traffic before forwarding to any other node. Managing
    the traffic would be easy on the server node, as once the server would receive
    the traffic from client A, the server would not send the same traffic back to
    client A (as that was the source in the first place). Instead, the server would
    send the traffic to the rest of the clients, but if this trade would be manipulated
    already, neither the remainder of the nodes or client A would never find out about
    it. Another issue would also be if the server would decide to send the traffic
    only for a particular group of clients, instead of all of them. Again, this could
    reduce the power of an extensive peer-to-peer network, and in the case of the
    blockchain, this would not be an advantage. The worse that could happen in a centralized
    network is this: once the server would receive traffic for the sake of conversation,
    data about the latest confirmed block, imagine that the server would decide not
    to share this data with any other client. This would just put the blockchain out
    of business. Therefore, the only way that the system would operate is to use a
    decentralized P2P network. In case you wonder how the server would make such a
    decision itself, well, it would not. Even though administering a server, or a
    small group of servers, may be straightforward for a person; when it comes to
    a P2P network, a person with evil intentions, like hacking purposes, or traffic
    manipulations, would have a hard time to do so and the reason is straightforward.
    Administering a large group of machines manually that reside all over the internet
    is nearly impossible. This is the reason why if you want to open a company, and
    you want to be the boss, you would create a traditional centralized network by
    having a master node that you can administer anytime you want. Again, P2P networks
    have no boss. Therefore, there is no one to blame, and every machine on the network
    shares the same responsibility.'

    latency. By the time one device reaches the other, it’s just never the same amount
    of time. Technically, latency is the time defined while the data travels between
    its source and final destination. This is something that you may consider understanding
    as data propagation can take some time, especially when there are thousands of
    nodes on a decentralized system.

    they know is once there is data that needs to get transferred across the network
    they will do a broadcast making sure that all nodes are receiving the same data.
    So back to our example of four nodes and their data propagation. Imagine that

    images, audio files, video files, or even software. It produces a unique hash
    based on that the particular file. An individual file goes through a hash on one
    end; then comes out scrambled on the other end. It doesn’t matter what kind of
    file you try it out on; the result is always different. For example, you might

    has been widely implemented, mainly used by software developers. One of the main
    reasons is making sure that the software is not modified or corrupted while downloading
    it. Personally, I had an issue before when I upgraded a Cisco Switch with a new
    code, which has gone into Rommon mode because I was too lazy to check the md5
    hash value of the software. Luckily, I was doing it within a test environment,
    and not in production network; however, it caused great pain and lost hours to
    recover the switch to its previous configuration. In my case I downloaded the
    code from the right source; but, it seemed to be that our Proxy server must have
    corrupted halfway. Still, if I would have checked the md5 hashing value of the
    new code, I would have been more successful at the task.

    are also called shared secrets. As you can see the problem here is that both the
    sender as well the receiver must use the same key for both encryption and decryption
    too. Of course, this is not an advantage when it comes to security, and the blockchain
    is certainly not using Symmetric key algorithms. I wanted to introduce some of

    One of them is called “Public” and the other is called “Private” key. The reason
    for having two keys is simple. One of the keys will be responsible for encrypting
    information to become a cypher text, and the other is to decrypt the information
    to become plain text. The private key would be generated by the originator, the
    one who would encrypt the information, and this private key must be kept secret
    at all times. However, the public key would be available to anyone, this is why
    it’s called the public key.

    like that. However, blockchain is correctly using the one called: Elliptic Curve
    Digital Signature Algorithm.'

    Once the private key has been used to encrypt the information to become a cypher
    text, it is necessary to use the public key to decrypt the information back to
    plain text. On the other hand, this process can be interchanged and used the opposite
    way too. For example, I would encrypt the information using the public key; then
    I would decrypt the scrambled text back to plain text using the private key.

    let me begin by explaining it. Imagine that you want to create a document by adding
    a digital signature to it so that anyone would know that it belongs to you. What
    you can do first, is to hash the data. Next, you can use a private key to encrypt
    your data. That's it, as the encrypted hash is your digital signature. Taking
    this further to prove that it is indeed your digital signature, you have to send
    the document to someone who can then decrypt your data. Once you send your text
    to your friend, you also have to carry the digital signature along with the document.
    Once your friend has received the document, he or she should decrypt your document
    by using your public key. This time the result of the hash value of the document
    would be HASH1\.

    document is originated from you, and it is indeed yours. Today’s digital world

    in the other direction. When the generator has raised two different components,
    the solution distributes uniformly around the clock. If we raise any base number
    to any exponent x then the solution is equally likely to be any number between
    zero to 17\. However, the reverse procedure is hard. For example, having the product
    number and you want to find the exponent is hard to do. This is called the discrete
    logarithm problem. Now we have our one-way function, that is easy to perform,
    but hard to reverse. It is trial and error really, but if you want to know how
    hard it can be, then let me tell you. Well, having small numbers, this is easy
    to reverse engineer; however, if we use a prime modulus that is hundreds of digits
    long, it becomes impractical to solve. Even if you have access to all computation

    systems are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data; for example,
    images or audio, that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed
    to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without
    modification and any alteration during transport. Base-64 encoding schemes use
    both capital A-Z, lower case a-z letters as well 0-9 numbers for the first 62
    values, and the symbols of + (plus), / (slash).

    the peer-to-peer network are creating these blocks. These nodes are called miners.
    All the miners are collecting every transaction that people are sending to each
    other over the network, and only valid transactions are relayed to the other nodes.
    Each miner takes a number of these collected operations and puts them in a newly
    formed block. These lists of transactions are numbered tx0, tx1, tx2, … and so
    on. Tx stands for transaction, followed by the number. The first transaction (tx0)
    is also known as the coinbase transaction. This is the transaction where the miner
    assigns a block reward to his address. This is how Bitcoins are created. For Bitcoin
    miners, as of now in 2017, the block reward is 12.5 Bitcoins; however, back in
    the day of the genesis block, the reward was 50 bitcoins for each block creation.

    have been 64 halvings, the block reward will be zero. There will be a maximum
    number of 21 million Bitcoin in circulation in the year of 2140\. Other Bitcoin

    it is because there is an issue that needs to be addressed. The problem currently
    with the blocks is simple. Each block can handle 1MB of data, meaning all transaction
    details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once there is enough data within a block, the block gets sealed, and miners
    start to create another new block. The issue that needs to be addressed is that
    each block gets filled with some data, but indeed it has been identified that
    there should be more data within each block. I have explained previously that
    each block contains lots of data, in fact, every transaction details are recorded
    on the blockchain, specifically, within the blocks. Data such recorded are the
    block number, destination address, source address, transaction value, hashing
    algorithms, and so on; however, one of the most important data recorded, is the
    actual script that contains the digital signatures as well the public keys. To
    have a block validated on the blockchain peer-to-peer network, these parts of
    the blockchain rules had to be within the script. However, it has been identified
    that the current situation is slowing down the system, and an upgrade is required.
    This scaling issue needed to be addressed; therefore, blockchain developers came
    up with an idea.

- en: 'The solution is called SegWit. However, the real plan to implement SegWit is
    to remove the script from the blocks, making the blocks lighter; therefore, leaving
    more space for additional transactions, as well, speed up the system. However,
    the proposal has a possible side effect. The reality is that the script is still
    going to be required as the rules of the blockchain cannot be changed, therefore,
    part of the proposal is that there will also be an extended block that will have
    the script. This is of course very confusing for many, especially for those who
    have no technical background. The other problem is that developers are not sure
    if it''s going to work out ok or not: even though they believe it is needed, hence
    the change proposal in the first place. Still, we only can find out once implemented.
    This solution is a solution for many other issues too. One is that each transaction
    fee is very cheap; however, it could be even less expensive. What you have to
    understand is that bitcoin is an excellent digital currency when it comes to values
    such as $100 worth or more. However, in order to implement it worldwide in every
    store, it requires some upgrades.'

    fees could cost you around $0.30 cents. However, when you want to buy an espresso
    from your local coffee shop that costs a dollar, a $0.30 cent transaction fee
    could be just too expensive. So, what has been identified is this: If we could
    add more transactions to each block, like twice as much, that could mean that
    each transaction would cost half of what it is now. However, in order to fit more
    transactions to a block, something has to be removed. What has been discovered,
    is that the script can be re-written and added to an extended block on the original
    block, and this would be called Segregated Witness aka SegWit.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is it called SegWit?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The witness is also known as Cryptographic proofs, and the signatures that are
    used are also witnessing the proofs. Separating the signatures from both the transaction
    data structure and the block data structure into their data structure. Taking
    the signatures out of the transaction data structure is the main reason; however,
    there are some side effects, so let’s take a look at them. First, side effects
    are not always bad, in fact, regards to SegWit, there are some very positive outcomes
    possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The original goal was to clean up some of the functions of Bitcoin. One thing
    that is not static within the transaction data is the digital signature. To be
    fair, everything else is covered by the signature, therefore, cannot be changed
    effectively, unless invalidating the signature; however, the signature itself
    can be malleated. So, once the signature would be taken out of the transaction
    data, the transaction ID would not be based on the signature anymore.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The transaction ID’s hash is not based on the signature, which means that the
    transaction ID cannot be malleated. This, in itself, is a massive development,
    and it helps with chaining transactions, additionally helps with lightning networks,
    as well payment channels and it will resolve lots of problems that we currently
    have with transaction malleability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Transaction malleability:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In simple terms, transaction malleability, is a cork in Bitcoin, and other cryptographic
    systems, where you can make unauthorized changes to transactions and re-broadcast
    with a different transaction ID. You cannot change where the funds are coming
    from, neither where the funds are going, because the signature covers that; however,
    you can make small modifications to the signature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s think of this in simple terms. Let's say that the signature contained
    the number 5\. The analysis of the algorithm 5, and 05 are the same, but if you
    pad a number in a certain way, it will change the fingerprint of that transaction,
    even if that signature is interpreted the same way. Therefore, you can modify
    part of the signature because they are not covered by the signature and they would
    produce a transaction with an entirely different ID. By doing that, you can jam
    it into the network and cause confusion. Transaction malleability has been blamed
    for some thefts and Bitcoin exchanges, where people mostly are getting a form
    of double withdraw, using transaction malleability. It also allows you to carry
    out a DOS – Denial of Service Attack, against the network; as well, against the
    people who are using payment channels or chaining many transactions together.

- en: How does SegWit allow more transactions on the network?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of the interesting side effects of SegWit is that you can start counting
    block sizes differently and give some capacity to increase directly through the
    SegWit. Transactions are the key to opening the door to get into the blockchain;
    therefore, you need a signature on the transaction to be validated to the blockchain.
    However, once the transaction is in the blockchain, nobody checks those signatures
    ever again; typically we do not go back to see old transactions that happened
    a long time ago. They’re only buried within the blockchain. They have been validated:
    therefore, old transactions are already trusted. The signature is only used once
    for validation. For example, when you write a paper check, you have the option
    to go to your online banking system and look at the image of the check after it
    has been submitted and cashed. It''s not part of the bank statement, and you don’t
    need it for anything other than to check it once to see that it was validated;
    after, it''s only hanging around, no need for it anymore. Same thing applies to
    signatures. What you have to understand is that digital signatures take 75% of
    the total space of some transactions. Additionally, the more transactions there
    are, the bigger the signature gets. Large complex scripts and multi signatures
    have huge signatures, and they take up a lot of space on the blockchain, and,
    again, nobody ever cares about them once they have been validated.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The other part of the SegWit wasn’t considered until recently because fixing
    malleability and removing transaction signatures from the transaction data is
    something that requires considering the whole network, and it’s been assumed that
    it needs a hard fork. However, there is a way to proceed using soft fork instead
    of hard fork. Indeed, it’s a fascinating trick. This method allows you to put
    a version number in front of the Bitcoin script. What that does, is allows you
    to upgrade the version number of the script, while old clients cannot see the
    difference, but still able to validate transactions entirely. Former customers
    can continue to operate without upgrading, and all that is different is that they
    are endorsing a little less they used to do before. Additionally, new clients
    can upgrade scripts. Once you have a new version of a script (this is awesome)
    as you can introduce endless amounts of soft forks parallel to change all kinds
    of scripting mechanisms. This trick is not only good to use for SegWit, but all
    other kinds of new developments. This is accelerating the innovation in the scripting
    language. Altogether these aspects: Segregated witness, Transaction malleability,
    increasing the capacity of the block by removing lots of information that’s not
    used after validation, and the same time upgrading version scripts—make a truly
    compelling feature and resolve lots of problems.'

    set, meaning you want to implement this soft fork, the miners then set that bit.
    Once 75% of the blocks have that bits set, you are activating the feature, then
    once 95% of the blocks have the bits set than that feature is forced for validation.
    It's a two-step voting process.

    incremental features can be voted on parallel. Previously, they had been implemented

    block version 3 to block version 4, and so on.
  prefs:

    can do all these in parallel. Previously, it was that only one soft fork could
    have been implemented at the time, and the vote had to be completed by the way.
    It is hard to accept one, dismiss another, and move to the next. However, with
    the new proposal, you can implement multiple soft forks simultaneously.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    terms, let me provide an example for better understanding. Imagine that you want
    to open an old Microsoft word document. Word 1998 documents can be opened with
    the current version of Microsoft Word. This is what backward compatibility is,
    meaning it recognizes old formats.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, forward compatibility is when the version of Microsoft Word
    from 1998 that has not been upgraded would still open a document that we use today,
    or at least in a certain way. It may not be able to see all original details correctly,
    and may not be able to understand some of the features; however, it still would
    be able to open the document. Therefore, soft forks have forward compatibility,
    meaning that clients who have not yet upgraded to the new code will not break
    and won’t stop validating so they can still maintain validating on the current
    consensus chain. All there is, is that they are validating less information because
    they may not be able to see the new features; however, they can ignore them while
    validating.
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    approve blocks, and you are no longer part of the consensus chain, therefore,

    before, any change to the system apparently will cause effects. Soft forks, hard
    forks, they all have bugs, even though all these features are always tested on
    Testnet. For example, segregated witness testnet had been running for months before
    implementation, and that allows to have more faith before any change. Miners have
    become very concerned about any change and making sure there are multiple tests
    before any implementation takes place. The general belief is that soft forks are
    less dangerous than hard forks, but the problem that some people identify is that
    they do not force the network to upgrade, meaning you can end up with lots of
    old clients that validate less transactions. However, some other developers prefer
    to have more of a strict approach, and just believe that if you don’t upgrade,
    you should be off the network. Therefore, it’s more like a philosophical issue
    rather than technical.

    was on a cash to hand basis, and it was not recorded anywhere; therefore, I cannot

    of people. Each month people are working on pay slips, making sure everyone will
    get paid correctly, and still before any validation, it has to go through the
    bank, in fact, many banks, to get everyone paid. Therefore, lightning networks

    the platform named Bitcoin. Bitcoin is blockchain. However, Bitcoin itself is
    only a cryptocurrency that is capable of replacing fiat currencies. Nevertheless,
    not that many people will like the idea at first. Blockchain has solved the problem
    that we have always faced, that is trust, using Elliptic Curve Cryptography and
    a huge amount of computation power. Using blockchain technology enables us to
    avoid trusting third party services, by replacing them with digital signatures,
    and mathematical algorithms. Therefore, any payment or exchange over the internet
    will be between 2 parties only. This is revolutionary as we can expand the trust
    gap, and the market of the future not only will be faster and cheaper, but will
    have no limitations, such as age, race, sex, occupation, nationality, or anything
    like that.
