- en: Blockchain is a type of database that is shared across a network of computers,
    by allowing the transparency of transaction. Records containing information are
    added to the database, bundled together into what called as blocks. These blocks
    are then linked together to form a chain—hence blockchain. When we talk about
    blockchain ecosystems (a group of organisms interacting with one another within
    their surroundings), there are the groups of actors (users, miners, developers
    & researchers, etc.) interacting with each other within the world of blockchain
    and with the encompassing off-chain world. The core interactions between these
    actors take place in the form of transactions, but these transactions are almost
    entirely limited to the blockchain itself. In lay man language to understand blockchain-at
    present some of the countries already adopted an online ballot voting system which
    includes a voting registration database, electronic devices and software. For
    voting, firstly individual has to register himself which includes his identity
    number, name, phone number and personal information then it is stored in the software.
    From the cyber security perspective it is easy to disrupt the software by just
    attacking on the voter’s registration database. Each part in the election process
    whether it is hardware or software is at major risk of hacking. When the software
    system is manipulated it can lead to the inappropriate election result. Not limited
    to that, after hacking the database of voters they can easily access their social
    media accounts. So, the sufferers at the end are the common people. To solve this
    issue the new technology blockchain can be used to provide security during voting
    time. With its transparency, immutability and accountability properties this can
    be attained up to some exact level. It ensures that digital data must come from
    the trusted source by using cryptography.

    to store individual’s identity records such as biometrics, iris scanning and many
    more for authentication voters and to record their records in the tabulation format.
    Blockchain technology is like having public key—visible to anyone, can help each
    individual voters and election conducting oﬃcials in counting number of votes
    without any malfunctioning in the system and which tends to a fair election outcome.
    Basically, this new technology has completely eradicated the third party i.e.
    electronic devices (Hardware), hence does not involve disturbance in the entire
    system. Moreover it enhances the security level of the entire system by providing
    copy of data to other nodes existing in the network. If hacker tries to modify
    the record of one node then it has to manipulate the data on the other nodes too
    on which same information exists which is quite complicated. Thus blockchain acts
    as a shield for preventing the system against cyber-attacks. Fraudulency can be
    minimized as the data has been copied to more than one place.

    is defined by constructing a ring around organizations, individuals, and things

    broad and sustainable markets aligning with emerging customer preferences and

    it allows the interconnectedness not only with producers or sellers but also with
    the consumers. Its aforementioned correlativity permits to build systems that
    can selectively take profit of the blockchain—in its trustworthiness, clarity,
    and decentralization. The Blockchain ecosystem is helpful to maintain the environmental
    sustainability as it is having potential to verify the transparency of the transaction
    records—data which has to be transferred and the person having the data at present
    can both be verified by blockchain technology. This can be implemented by the

    of natural calamities, poverty or extreme climate changes, interruption of electricity
    is a very common problem encountered by every citizen not accessing to power which
    ultimately leads to blackouts. Blockchain environmental ecosystem prepares for
    this kind of situation if it ever takes place. To decrease the requirement to
    transmit the electricity to far places it has P2P blockchain which is based on
    blockchain energy system. This can help in transmission of the electricity from
    local areas where it’s originally generated to the areas where it is required.
    This also supports in reducing the energy storage. A platform which can solve
    this problem working on the blockchain is a Trans active Grid which is a combined
    legal agreement between two blockchain companies, ConsenSys and LO3 Energy. If
    someone wants to get return or want to gain profit there is a way provided by

    but by how much? Can you determine how much every product is making an effect
    on the environment? It can be calculated if we are aware of the carbon imprints.
    When planning to buy a four-wheeler petrol, diesel or CNG vehicle, which one would
    you prefer apart from monetization point of view? Obviously, that one which has
    less carbon emission so that global warming will not go beyond its alarming rate.
    Carbon tax is the tax which is applied at the time of extraction of fuel which
    is an indirect strategy to control emission of greenhouse gases produced when
    burning hydrocarbon (carbon compounds). The private sector imposed tax on the
    carbon with aim of lessening the emission of Co2 in the environment which results
    to degradation of forests. When these taxes are collected they should be used
    in the afforestation program but due to the many political winds the funds collected
    are used somewhere else. Blockchain technology has driven towards afforestation
    and degradation. It directly transfers the funds to the environmental ecosystem
    not in the pockets of intermediaries. In this context, the blockchain keeps the
    transparency between all the participants so that the funds obtain by depositing
    carbon will be applied in forest conservation program only. Considering the effect
    of CO2, manufacturers and producers also join hands by giving incentives to those
    companies who are selling products with low carbon footprints and a little piece
    of cake to the consumers also who are following this trend. Blockchain acts as
    a game changer as it is provides the tracking of carbon imprints of every product.
    However some companies are producing products which have high carbon footprints
    so that Blockchain technology will compel them to change their supply chain as
    well as customers to buy products that have less adverse effect on the environment.
    The score based on the carbon footprints of the products sold by each company
    is determined by the blockchain-based system. Thus by adapting blockchain, there
    will be more transparency and termination of practices which are harmful to environment.

    ecosystem are having bundle of advantages but with the adoption of new technology
    there are many unintended outcomes also in the coming years—the blockchain can
    really become a burden that planet earth has to bear with. The technology require
    energy to keeps its longevity so in the blockchain technology the energy released
    by using the crypto currency are of very high intensity. Crypto currencies are
    bitcoin, litecoin, doge coin, bat, Ethereum, neo, ripplexrp, cardano and many
    more. Whenever in use, it require a significant amount of energy, although not
    all of them. Some operate on less amount of energy. Transaction of crypto currencies—Ehereum,
    Neo and Cardano—require 13 times lesser than the energy needed to transact bitcoin.
    This is an additional feature that blockchain solution is adding to the next gen
    computers to be as energy eﬃcient directed with the increase in power and computational
    speed but keeping the low usage of energy. Many organizations are constructing
    energy bare blockchain framework which will be operating on PoA. In order to make
    earth a better planet, Building Blockchains so that the blockchain energy usage
    can be applied in the appropriate direction i.e. the incentives arising from the
    uptake of renewable resources and de-carbonization must be used for the reforestation.
    If the transaction of single Bitcoin can consume power almost one fifth of the
    country’s houses per day then it can be predicted how much there is a need for
    blockchain solution as an energy savior. Moreover to that, for every 11 min a
    new Bitcoin transaction takes place. This is the need of an hour for the Blockchain
    technology which is at its beginning state that will be beneficial for many sectors
    if used appropriately in both technology protocols and its applications parts.

    in both environment and business ecosystems. No doubt, this technology is better
    in every field for providing the transparency, saving energy usage and is far
    better as compared to the traditional models. But whenever some technology comes
    in the market it brings some challenges along with it. The technical issue that
    blockchain technology address is limited with is scalability because of foreordain
    in terms of the size of blocks and energy used by the crypto currencies. Though
    blockchain technology is decentralized, distributed and based on cryptographic
    techniques, it is not totally exempted from security issues as rising of cloud
    computing and quantum computing combined with the physical, digital and biological
    areas with the increase in speed and intelligence can prove dangerous to the blockchain
    ecosystem.

    willingly share all these duties. The demand of the present time has compelled
