    with Robotics & AI. It is assumed that blockchain capabilities can bring in great
    alteration to the world economies, businesses, and societies in general all over
    the world. The hype around it makes it seem to be a perfect technology but the
    reality is quite different. The truth is that blockchain as a technology is still
    immature and is developing as we discuss it. Therefore numerous issues exist in
    adoption of blockchain like privacy, decentralization, regulatory and business
    model challenges which need to be addressed before embracing blockchain as a foundational
    technology for businesses. This chapter explores the prevalent security and privacy
    challenges associated with blockchain in detail and the negative implications
    of these challenges. Lastly it suggests certain Blockchain applications which
    support the acceptance and adoption of blockchain technology.

    Originally it was invented in 2009 as the backbone technology for Bitcoin [1].
    But since then, with the advancement of blockchain technology, it has found application
    from just the crypto-currencies to a vast number of areas such as healthcare,
    agriculture, Internet of Things (IoT), SCM and others.

    of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among
    participating parties” [2]. Each and every transaction is stored in the distributed
    ledger and must be verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in
    the system. This verified information can then never be erased [2]. Bitcoin, the
    digital currency introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, is the most popular example
    of use of blockchain technology [3]. Bitcoins, based on public cryptology, are
    the first decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency which has no central server
    or principal authority to mint and supervise the currency [4].

    that supports to carry out the financial transactions in a distributed decentralized
    way needing no intermediaries. Blockchain has led to development of robust ecosystem
    of not just Bitcoin [5] but also other altcoins such as Litecoin [6], Ethereum
    [7], Zero cash [8] and Monero [9]. An estimate of 2018 claims that [10], the market
    value of Bitcoin is over $112 billion while that of Ethereum is over $47 billion.
    It further states that more than 60,000 blockchain transactions are carried out
    per hour worldwide.

    it is finding uses in all the applications which work on decentralized platform.
    For example in case of Internet of Things (IoT) which works on peer to peer topology
    and various devices which are Internet enabled. Therefore, using the blockchain
    in IoT devices, all the connected devices can be easily automated and data can
    be synchronized much faster [11,12]. Similarly in case of Supply chain management
    systems, blockchain can augment the transparency of system and makes the tracking
    of ownership easier [13,14]. Blockchain further supports the identity management
    system and the public key infrastructure as discussed in Refs. [15–17].

    to change the future of business transaction but it does have its dark side which
    consists of security and privacy issues of this technology and cannot be ignored.
    These issues can lead to huge losses for the parties involved. For example in
    a blockchain based supply chain management (SCM) system if the communication or
    information is not protected, it can lead to leaking of trade secrets which can
    be very harmful to suppliers. Even in other application based scenarios any financial
    or non financial information leaks can have drastic impact therefore it is very
    important to understand the various security and privacy issues which entail Blockchain
    technology. This study in depth deals with systematic evaluation of various security
    and privacy challenges and the potential application of Blockchain solutions in
    various domains.

    papers post 2000 were targeted with more focus on research articles of last ten
    years. The databases like Scopus, Ebsco, Proquest, and Google Scholar were used
    to search for the papers. The search began with the initial keyword “Blockchain”
    to understand the wider concept which was later fine tuned to “Blockchain security”,
    “Blockchain Privacy”, “Blockchain issues”, “Blockchain application” among others.
    In total 102 abstracts were downloaded based on the relevance to the subject matter
    which after further analysis were shortlisted to 61 full papers which were downloaded
    for further study. Based on the analysis of literature, the challenges of blockchain
    as well as the applications of Blockchain technology are presented in the next

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though only one blockchain should exist as it’s a sequential connection of the
    blocks generated, but if two different peers at same time are able to mine the
    answer for generating the block, then two latest blocks can be generated and blockchain
    can be divided into two. Therefore if more and more peers work together in order
    to become mining pools they would have more computing power. Once they hold 51%
    computing power it becomes a very serious security issue [18,19]. So if an attacker
    has 51% mining capability, they can dictate the Nonce value and hence the authority
    over blocks which can lead to falsified transactions [20]. They can easily decide
    which blocks are permissible and further modify transactional data within blocks.
    They can cause double spending attack [21,22] or stop the verification of transaction
    or even mine any available block [23]. In present day such mining pools are increasingly
    trying to dominate the blockchain thus this risk has become an issue. An example
    of such an attack was by GHash, a leading mining pool, which for a short time
    controlled the mining power exceeding the 50% threshold which forced the Bitcoin
    community to make large scale adjustments to deal with the risk and affected its
    market price [24,25].

    nodes agree to common rules about blocks. This complete consensus among the network
    participants or the nodes means verified data leading to single blockchain which
    is deemed correct by everyone. But in certain situation like when new software
    is published or change in protocol is made, all parties may not agree to it or
    are not in consensus thus leading to alternative chains or fork situation [23].
    This had a very wide range impact. Thus when a new protocol change or software
    upgrade is made it leads to two kinds of nodes in the blockchain—the New Nodes
    and the Old Nodes. Based on the interactions between the old and the new nodes
    two kinds of forks can occur

- en: A  hard fork  means that though as per a rule change a systems starts working
    as per new rules and new nodes but the old nodes are still working as per old
    rules hence all such old nodes will see the blocks produced according to the new
    rules as invalid. The old nodes are not in agreement with the new nodes’ mining
    therefore the one chain gets divided into two chains [23]. Though new nodes have
    stronger computing power than the old nodes but even then the old nodes which
    do not upgrade will continue working as usual on a completely different chain
    which they thinks is right, thus the ordinary chain will fork into two chains.
    It can be a huge risk again as two chains are created. The solution is the upgrading
    of all the nodes hence all nodes in the network are requested to upgrade to the
    new agreement. Therefore, in case of Hard forks where if no consensus is made,
    it can split the community into two entirely dissimilar blockchains which is risky
    for the blockchain users [26].

    do not accept or approve the block by old nodes but they are backward compatible.
    The old nodes do not realize the rule changes and continues to accept blocks created
    by newer nodes which follow the new rule set [23]. Thus old nodes accepting the
    blocks from new nodes will end up building on top of blocks from new nodes and
    which will keep on working on the same chain as result only one chain is create
    though they do not fully understand or validate the new system. The risk is that
    soft fork does not make the old nodes aware that the fundamental principle of
    verification by every node is invalidated as the consensus rule has changed [23,24].

    would take 2 or 3 days to confirm the transaction the blockchain based transactions
    like in case of Bitcoins it takes only about 20–45 min for transaction verification.
    Some data scientists even find this a slow rate and not good enough as it leaves
    window open for the double-spend attack and race attack
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a Bitcoin transaction takes place, the transaction is confirmed after a while,
    only when the block has a depth of 5 or 6 in which the transaction is stored hence
    it can on average take 20 to 40 min [28]. Since the confirmation time is dependent
    on many factors there can be large variance in the range of timing for confirmation.
    In certain speedy payment situations, the traders do not wait for confirmation
    to come in; therefore in such cases the malicious attackers can fraudently spend
    the money twice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Race attacks are also carried out in such similar situations. In this fraud
    the scammer carries out a transaction directly with the merchant, who promptly
    accepts it. The scammer then misusing the lag in the confirmation carries out
    contradictory transactions of transferring the same coins to himself on the network.
    In such a scenario, the probability of second transaction getting confirmed is
    high and hence the merchant ends up being cheated. In case of Finney [29] attack
    which is a more refined version of double spend is carried out using help of a
    miner. Thus faster time confirmation is required to protect against these attacks.

    In blockchain technology the chain of blocks is continuously growing. For example
    in case of Bitcoin it grows 1 MB per block every 10 min and the copies of the
    chain are stored only with the full nodes -those nodes which can fully validate
    the blocks and the transactions which are there in the network [26]. As the chain
    size grows the nodes needs additional storage space and hence it decreases the
    capacity of the system. Also the huge chains negatively impact the performance,
    increasing the synchronization time for new users. In blockchain network, nodes
    are supposed to authenticate each transaction of each block based on consensus
    protocol for Transaction validation. Further, the transaction confirmation time
    is dependent upon the computational power which is modulated by the number of
    transactions in a block and the time between blocks [23]. Therefore the consensus
    protocol directly influences the scalability of blockchain networks.

    group of people owns IoT assets and shares between them the revenues collected.
    It’s an open investment opportunity where in the investor by default receives
    their shares of profits as and when their owned IoT assists are put to use. This
    is done through an automatic process executed by ethereum smart contracts. The
    platforms on which all transactions are executed is continuously updated, maintained
    and controlled by a central smart contract. Platforms are required to be installed
    and establishes link between different asset types and IoT devices.

    combined with encryption to produce an electronic name to be given to all physical
    objects. Blockchain technology established the secure medium of interaction and
    transaction between devices. The device in the Blockchain framework becomes its
    nodes with a crypto chip which is found to be a sticky NFC tag that can’t be removed.
    This crypto chip is given the identity while doing a Blockchain transaction by
    an android application. This chip is used to interact with other devices in the
    system after its validation.

- en: In the cloud computing environment, the disclosure of user data can lead to
    psychological and financial damages which are mostly due to leakage of sensitive
    users information [20]. The main concern to study in cloud computing environment
    is the security, confidentiality and integrity of storage and dissemination of
    the data as the privacy protection and anonymity is still a critical issue. The
    concept of Blockchain technology offers the anonymity which in case of cloud computing
    can not only provide a convenient but also a strongly secured service to the users.
    The use of secure electronic wallets is a solution to the security issues. In
    Blockchain, electronic wallets are used for transactions but they are not deleted
    properly it can lead to user information leakage [60].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore to solve this issue a solution that can install and delete the electronic
    wallet securely should be implemented [4]. Further, the secure electronic wallets
    can also help in preventing the double spend attacks. Though mostly wallets are
    saved on computers but with the advent of mobile technology it is very important
    to ensure the security of these wallets on mobile devices as well. Just like in
    computers the transaction confirmation over the mobiles should only be done when
    both the accuracy of a time stamp generated and the integrity of the transaction
    through a mobile device are correct [61].

- en: The blockchain technology tries to hide and prevent personal information of
    the cloud computing user from leaking by removing the electronic wallets completely.
    The blockchain therefore can use secure wallets which are installed, used and
    removed securely by sending the finished message. Thus, the blockchain solution
    improves the security by “providing residual information protection since it encrypts
    the data using a public key and verifies the complete removal of the electronic
    wallet” [4].

- en: Disruptive technologies always create a storm, which settles down when more
    and more people accept it. Blockchain is such a disruptive technology which no
    doubt has become a hot debatable issue in recent years but this technology is
    here to stay. The benefits of this technology are being realized overtime and
    therefore it is slowly gaining acceptance and applications in so many domains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain is being adopted but at the same time yet being in infancy stage
    there is no adequate guarantee of it being perfect. It is therefore very imperative
    to understand the security issues or privacy issue and stay cautious as these
    can lead to loss for its users. This study has identified and presented an evaluation
    of the various common security challenges such 51% attack, Denial of Services,
    Sybil Attack, etc. along with the techniques adopted by malicious attackers for
    de-anonymization to provide a complete overview of these challenges. Based on
    the evaluation of these challenges further domain wise solutions are presented
    which can help in mitigating the negative issues that can crop up. Though the
    technology itself is improving with new technique’s being developed which are
    more mature and stable on application side.

- en: For future work one of the critical aspects is to frame the legal rules around
    this technology. The governments globally need to develop corresponding laws for
    this technology, as more and more enterprises are and would be embracing the Blockchain
    technology. Another aspect is the market preparation for this technology so as
    to prevent any negative impact to current system. Further the research efforts
    should be made in area of finding solutions for improving the security and privacy
    aspects of Blockchain. Emphasis should also be given to scalability and storage
    capacity solutions required for this technology. Beyond the all technical aspects
    of Blockchain, in case of cryptocurrencies the volatility risk is one of the critical
    aspects which is exploited by many people to take undue advantage of the scarce
    understanding of this phenomenon. Therefore, volatility issues need more research.
    Lastly, the Blockchain, the technology of future needs further research about
    its application in form of case studies in various domains and areas in which
    it can be adopted so as to understand its nuances and its repercussions.
