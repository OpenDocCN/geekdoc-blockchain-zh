- en: Nimit grew up in a Sikh family in India during the turbulent 1980s, when the
    assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi led to a religious backlash
    against Sikhs. Although not yet old enough to vote, Nimit tagged along with his
    grandfather to the polls on election day. There, he witnessed people, including
    his grandfather, forced to vote at gunpoint, with their thumbs being pressed against
    an inkpad to verify their votes—vivid memories that he still carries to this day.
    Although he couldn’t comprehend the full scope of what he was seeing, he knew
    that this was something bad and that he should work to prevent it from happening
    again.

    ideas for a better future. Drawing upon his childhood memory for inspiration and
    his decades-long background in mobile security and payments technology, Nimit
    and his brother developed a prototype with one purpose: to create a trustworthy

    Voatz had to weigh the trade-offs between permissioned and permissionless systems.
    The tricky balance was to keep the system *decentralized* (anyone could run a
    node), while *centralizing* it enough to keep it free from foreign influence (nodes
    were carefully vetted and could be shut down if needed).

    blockchain, all nodes must be vetted (or approved). Scaling on a blockchain, however,
    has advantages because of network effects. By increasing the number of nodes from
    4 to 16, for example, we don’t just quadruple the system capacity; thanks to the
    **quadratic growth** of network effects, we increase it by a factor of 20.
