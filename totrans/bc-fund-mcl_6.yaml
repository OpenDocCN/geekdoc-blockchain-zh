    which has been deployed since 2009\. There are significant technical challenges
    pertaining to the massive resource consumption for certain protocols; security;
    performance and scalability; anonymity for public blockchains; confidentiality
    for private blockchains; and interoperability. This chapter examines all of these
    challenges and their emerging solutions.

    ready’ in that the software is secure enough and ready to handle the volume, speed,
    and confidentiality requirements for enterprise applications. Fortunately, people
    from around the world are collaborating to address these technical challenges
    for both permissionless and permissioned blockchains. As the quotes above attest,
    nearly all the blockchain experts we spoke to view the technical challenges as
    manageable; the open source communities as well as private enterprises just need
    more time to identify, debate, and develop technical solutions. Managers in traditional
    enterprises certainly need to be aware of the technical challenges and should
    monitor the emerging solutions, which vary significantly between permissionless
    and permissioned blockchains. Technical issues also point to the skills enterprises
    need to start building today.

    The computational intensity of a given blockchain’s consensus protocol is the
    main driver of resource consumption. Recalling from [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml),
    Bitcoin and Ethereum use the safest, yet computationally most resource-demanding
    protocol called a Proof-of-Work. Bitcoin’s first miners, back in 2009, could successfully
    compete for a block reward using their desktop computers. As Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed,
    miners shifted to specialized hardware and shared computational power through
    mining pools. Specifically, Bitcoin requires an Application-Specific Integrated
    Circuit (ASIC). Ethereum mining requires a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Proof-of-Work
    is admittedly a resource hog for both of these public networks. In order to compete,
    large mining centers have been established (see [Figure 8.1](#f_8_1) for an example).

    transfer funds to another address. While users may store their digital wallets
    on their own devices, most users rely on centralized exchanges. Exchanges are
    a lucrative target for hackers because some exchanges control millions of private
    keys. We already covered one of the largest heists at ***Mt. Gox***. But that
    was back in 2014\. Jumping to 2019, there were twelve significant hacks of exchanges
    where $292 million worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen along with over 500,000
    login credentials.^([13](#fn_13)) Among them was Singapore-based ***Bittrue***,

    many blockchains have had heists resulting from software weaknesses in the code
    base. These typically happen within the first year of launch when the code base
    is still very new. The Bitcoin blockchain was hacked in August 2010 when someone
    exploited a software vulnerability to create 184 *billion* bitcoins, a highly
    suspicious act given the maximum money supply is only 21 *million* bitcoins.^([14](#fn_14))
    A hacker of Ripple was able to transfer 1000 bitcoins from an address that had
    only .0001 bitcoins in 2014.^([15](#fn_15)) As software updates are implemented,
    new vulnerabilities could be introduced. For example, a serious bug in a Bitcoin
    Core update was discovered in 2018 that could have brought down the network with
    a denial-of-service attack, a type of malicious attack that floods a network with
    so many transactions that it disrupts service for legitimate users. Fortunately,
    the Bitcoin Core developers spotted it and fixed it before hackers could exploit
    it.^([16](#fn_16)) Although the source code was fixed quickly, these episodes

    programs in smart contracts that execute on a blockchain. Our interest here is
    about a particular DAO, confusingly named ***The DAO*** (as opposed to ‘a’ DAO).
    The DAO is perhaps blockchain’s most ominous heist because its perpetrator(s)
    didn’t steal private keys from a digital wallet stored off a blockchain or exploit
    a weakness in the code base. Rather, the perpetrator(s) exploited a weakness in
    a smart contract launched on the Ethereum blockchain. Here is the story. . .

    contract called ‘The’ DAO on Ethereum. They designed the DAO as an investment
    mechanism to fund Ethereum-related startups. Whoever invested in the DAO—by sending
    Ethereum’s native digital asset (ether) to it during the fundraising round—could
    vote on investment ideas pitched to the DAO after launch. The DAO was deployed
    in May of 2016\. Despite the concerns some people voiced—like Professor Emin Gün
    Sirer of Cornell University—about the weaknesses in the code, money poured in.^([17](#fn_17))
    Because the votes on future projects were weighted by the size of the investment,
    people who wanted a powerful vote invested heavily.^([18](#fn_18)) The DAO raised
    $150 million worth of ether during its 28-day funding window, exceeding anyone’s
    expectations, as this represented 15 percent of the ether money supply. In June
    of 2016, a hacker (or hackers) exploited a weakness in the smart contract’s code
    to syphon $50 million in ether from the DAO’s fund into another account they controlled.
    The Ethereum community was powerless to stop it, as smart contracts run autonomously.
    Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, called for a complete stop in trading
    until the problem could be addressed. The price of ether fell immediately from
    $20 to $13.^([19](#fn_19))*'

    the stolen ether should be returned to the investors’ accounts.^([20](#fn_20))
    Some members of the open source community insisted that ***nothing*** should be
    done. The blockchain was not breeched; the coders of the smart contract did a
    poor job, so they should suffer the loss. Chat rooms were ablaze with analogies
    to the US federal government bailing out the banks during the Global Financial
    Crisis of 2008 and accused the Ethereum Foundation of acting like a government.
    The decision was made to let miners vote, weighing their votes by their hashing
    power. The miners voted for a hard fork—a permanent divergence in the Ethereum
    blockchain. The blocks were rolled back and the stolen ether was returned. Those
    miners who refused to follow the fork proceeded mining with the original code,
    leaving us with ***Ethereum*** (fork followers) and ***Ethereum Classic*** (non-fork

    Today’s digital computers are based on binary digits, called ‘bits’, which represent
    the state of a computation with a ‘0’ or a ‘1’. Today, we make digital computers

    one computation. Quantum computers will change this; they will be based on quantum

    the computer networks need a lot of computational power to validate transactions
    and to constantly monitor the integrity of records. All this computation slows

    Bitcoin and Ethereum struggled to process transactions within the targeted windows.

    settling close to that time as of February 2020\. Bitcoin was handling between
    3.3 and 7 transactions per second. Ethereum is designed to settle transactions
    in seven seconds, but the average was between 15 seconds and 5 minutes as of February
    2020.^([44](#fn_44)) Settlement times are not fast enough for transactions requiring
    nearly instantaneous reaction times, such as IoT devices that monitor the status
    of critical systems, or for retail applications where a customer will certainly
    not wait around for a transaction to settle. Additionally, public blockchains
    like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered too small in scale to handle the volumes
    that will be required for many enterprise applications. For example, PayPal was
    handling 193 transactions per second in 2017, SWIFT—the global provider of secure
    financial messaging services—was processing about 329 messages per second,^([45](#fn_45))

    costs. For most of Bitcoin’s history, transaction fees were indeed very small,
    averaging about 11 cents (in US$) per transaction in June 2014, and 28 cents in
    December of 2016.^([49](#fn_49)) When the network is not congested, very small
    fees are enough to incentivize miners. For a specific example, we found a successful
    transaction on March 12^(th) 2017, where a person offered just 45 cents worth
    of bitcoins to transfer over $8200 worth of bitcoins.^([50](#fn_50)) However,
    when the network is congested, miners cannot include all of the newly validated
    transactions in the next block, so the miners’ algorithms select the transactions
    offering the highest fees. As Bitcoin traffic exploded in December of 2017, fees
    skyrocketed to as high as $55 per transaction.^([51](#fn_51)) During peak times
    in 2017, senders offering smaller fees sometimes waited days to be added to the
    blockchain, or worse, their orphaned transactions eventually dropped out and needed
    to be resent.^([52](#fn_52))

    Getting a globally diverse set of decentralized developers and miners to agree
    to upgrades is a considerable effort that can take years of negotiations and emergency
    meetings.^([53](#fn_53)) When the community cannot agree, splinter groups launch
    ‘hard forks’, which are permanent, divergent paths off of the original blockchain.
    This is why we now have not only the original Bitcoin, but Bitcoin XT; Bitcoin
    Classic; Bitcoin Gold; and Bitcoin Cash. Moreover, forks of forks happened when
    infighting continued. For example, Bitcoin Cash is a 2017 hard fork of Bitcoin,
    aiming to increase the size of blocks and to keep transaction fees low. The following
    year, the Bitcoin Cash community fought over two proposed upgrades, which prompted
    one faction to create a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash called Bitcoin SV (SV for ‘Satoshi
    Vision’). Thus, the communities do not always agree on technical upgrades. Here,
    we highlight some of the major performance and scaling solutions for Bitcoin,
    called Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network. We also cover Catenis—as
    an example of an innovation by a startup—as well as innovations for Ethereum,

    protocol change in Bitcoin since its inception.^([54](#fn_54)) It improved Bitcoin
    in a number of ways. Firstly, SegWit squeezed more transactions into a block by
    moving digital signatures (called ‘witnesses’) from the sender’s address to a
    new part of a Bitcoin block. By segregating the signatures, block sizes increased
    from 1 megabyte to, possibly, 4 megabytes, thus improving throughput. This innovation
    also solved ***transaction malleability***—the possibility for a hacker to alter
    a digital signature before it is added to a block, which would change the transaction
    ID. The recipient would still receive the bitcoins, but the sender would not be
    able to find it by searching for the transaction ID (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml)).

    the use of the ***Lightning Network***. The Lighting Network tracks intermediate
    transfers of funds off-chain and only posts the value of the initial credit and
    the final account balance transfers to the blockchain. The solution helps unclutter
    the blockchain with intermediate transactions. Functionally, it’s like opening
    up a bar tab. A person secures a bar tab with a credit card, orders several drinks
    (or sends a few drinks back), and then settles the final bill with one payment.

    design, which moved the anchor for the signatures from being embedded in the Merkle
    Root to the first transaction in the block (called the coinbase transaction) used
    to reward the winning miner. Another issue was the deployment strategy: SegWit
    was released as a ‘soft fork’, which means than non-SegWit adopters could still
    mine Bitcoins. Some miners thought it would be cleaner (yet more difficult) to
    release as a ‘hard fork’ (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml) for ‘*Forks*’). Many
    emergency meetings occurred among the Bitcoin community as SegWit was being debated.

    Since digital ledgers are immutable, how is this done technically? One way is
    to ‘burn’ the asset on one blockchain and then recreate it on a different blockchain
    (see [Figure 8.15](#f_8_15)). A proof-of-burn is an algorithm that sends value
    to a verifiably un-spendable address that permanently locks that value on chain.
    For Bitcoin, this is achieved by using the scripting language for the transaction
    in a way that would ensure the value could never be redeemed. For example, setting
    the ‘txout’ to only execute if 2 = 3.^([89](#fn_89)) This, of course, does not

    BTC Relay automatically executes with no trusted third parties. BTC Relay is quite
    fascinating in how it incentivizes people to keep adding new Bitcoin blocks to
    the smart contract, on average, every ten minutes. ‘Relayers’ who submit new Bitcoin
    block headers to BTC Relay contract get paid a small transaction fee when other
    developers query BTC Relay to verify a transaction.^([93](#fn_93)) BTC Relay is
    in essence a ‘program’ that reads from one chain to ‘prove’ existence and then
    is used as a ‘true/false’ or as a value in the Ethereum platform.

- en: Many sidechains/relays use Satoshi Nakamoto’s ***Simple Payment Verification***
    (SPV). The idea is that someone can prove that their transaction is included in
    a valid block and that many other valid blocks were built on top of it. Nakamoto
    (2008) described SPV as a way to verify bitcoin transactions without running a
    full network node. Rather, one only needs to maintain a copy of the block headers
    and then find the security links—called a ***Merkle tree*** branch (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml))—to
    the transaction, to prove it was verified and accepted by the network. SPV shows
    that ‘tokens have been locked up on one chain so validators can safely unlock
    an equivalent value on the other chain.’^([110](#fn_110)) [Figure 8.17](#f_8_17)
    illustrates that SPV Proofs can be used to coordinate cross-chain transactions
    without relying on a notary but instead relying only on the algorithmic proofs.

- en: 'HTLCs are a clever way to coordinate transactions across two blockchains by
    relying on the same data trigger, called a ‘secret key’, ‘private key’ or ‘preimage’.
    [Figure 8.18](#f_8_18) shows how it works. Alice initiates a smart contract on
    one blockchain that locks value into an address with the hash of the secret key
    so that one of two things happen: The receiver, Bob, either retrieves the value
    in the address using the secret key (this is the ‘hash lock’) and his digital
    signature, or the contract, expires and returns the value to Alice (this is the
    ‘time lock’). So how will Bob get the secret key in a safe manner? Bob creates
    a smart contract on his chain and locks value using the same hash of the secret
    key. Alice must reveal the secret key (and her digital signature) to unlock the
    value in Bob’s contract. The instance that happens, Bob’s smart contract learns
    the secret key and uses it to unlock the value on Alice’s smart contract. It’s
    a simple, yet brilliant, solution that eliminates counter-party risks.'

    the ILP’s white paper back in 2015\. For a given payment, the ILP protocol sends
    many micropayments with confirmations between micropayments to minimize the risk
    that a node could steal or fail to send a payment through a network (see [Figure
    8.19](#f_8_19)). ILP uses ‘cryptographic escrow’ that ‘conditionally locks funds
    to allow secure payments through untrusted connectors.’^([112](#fn_112)) For a
    given transaction, the ILP recognizes three types of participants: sender, routers,
    and receiver. Routers (also called ‘connectors’) are nodes that find a trust path
    between the sender and receiver. Nodes use the same hashlock for HTLCs across
    the paths.^([113](#fn_113)) (For a detailed example of how HTCLs flow through
    an end-to-end transaction, see [https://interledger.org/rfcs/0022-hashed-timelock-agreements/](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0022-hashed-timelock-agreements/).)'

    and installed for each of the ledgers (blockchains) with which there is interaction.
    This means that as new platforms come online, if they do not follow a standard
    the protocol recognizes, one needs to be added.

- en: Thus far in our journey, we’ve examined the blockchain landscape, the promised
    benefits of enterprise blockchains, actual examples of enterprise blockchains
    across industries, and the major technical challenges and emerging technical solutions.
    Now we turn to business issues. In this chapter, we examine what it takes for
    traditional enterprises to actually gain value from enterprise blockchains. It’s
    not easy; enterprises face a daunting ‘technology-embeddedness’ challenge. Endemic
    to all technologies, live blockchain applications must be assimilated within complex
    institutional, political, regulatory, social, economic, and existing systems.^([2](#fn_2))
    But while most technology solutions are adopted *inside* firm boundaries, blockchains
    are best-suited for inter-organizational contexts. It requires an unprecedented
    level of cooperation with competitors and other mind shifts that only an executive
    can champion efficaciously. It’s no wonder that HfS Research found that only 131
    out of 940 (14 percent) of blockchain initiatives had reached the production stage
    by Q1 2020.^([3](#fn_3)) But the good news is that we can learn important lessons
    from early adopters.

    solutions a reality (see [Figure 9.1](#f_9_1)). Action principles are practices
    identified by our research that produced desirable results in real world implementations.
    Action principles are therefore grounded in data and are designed to assist other
    thoughtful agents as they embark on their own implementation journeys. Action
    principles are similar to best practices in that both seek to share knowledge
    from prior experiences. But whereas ‘best practices’ imply that mimicry is always
    recommended and will always produce similar results, action principles recognize
    that context matters. The usefulness of a practice depends on the objectives the
    organization is trying to achieve, whether the organization has the absorptive
    capacity to implement the practice effectively; and timing—there are better times
    than others to apply a specific practice. As social scientists, we view managers
    as thoughtful agents who scrutinize ‘best practices’ derived from other people’s
    learnings to decide when and whether practices need to be modified, or perhaps
    discarded, within their organizations.^([4](#fn_4))

    from uplifting the entire ecosystem to remove friction and other pain points.
    It requires working with competitors, trading partners, open source communities,
    and regulators. Traditional enterprises need to think differently about competitive
    advantage and what ‘winning’ entails. Traditional enterprises also need to shift
    their mindsets when moving from internal, command-and-control, centralized applications
    to shared, distributed applications. Specifically, traditional enterprises need
    to shift to **coopetition** and **shared governance** mindsets.

    apply. Beginning with his first book on the subject, the *Innovator’s Dilemma,*
    published in 1997, Christensen defined **disruptive innovation** as a *process*
    by which an innovation creates a new market that eventually disrupts an existing
    market, thereby displacing traditional enterprises.^([34](#fn_34))^,^([35](#fn_35))
    Christensen observed that traditional enterprises find it very difficult to break
    their successful business models by cannibalizing revenues from existing products
    with a disruptive innovation. But don’t rule out traditional enterprises, for
    the theory asserts that traditional enterprises can create disruption through
    a separate spinoff, and furthermore, can use technologies for what Christensen
    terms as **sustaining innovations**—those innovations that improve products and
    services within existing markets. Sustaining innovations can deliver substantial
    business value to the entire ecosystem; disruption does not have to be the strategic
    choice. To apply the Theory of Disruptive Innovation to blockchain ecosystems,
    one just needs to elevate the unit of analysis from the firm-level to the ecosystem-level.

    third parties or by-pass intermediaries (although their roles may change). Rather,
    successful endeavors happen when partners work together on the shared objectives
    of reducing friction amongst themselves, and ultimately benefiting their customers.
    In short, many of the enterprise blockchain solutions embody the motto ‘Rising
    tides raise all ships’. KoreConX, Santander’s Bond Issuance, IBM Food Trust, MediLedger,
    and WeTrade are examples of traditional enterprises coming together to uplifts
    all parties rather than to eliminate any one of them. No parties were threatened

    all laws and regulations that grant individuals the right to be forgotten. Designing
    for immutability also requires using quantum-resistant cryptography so that the
    cryptography we use today will remain secure in the future. This means using larger-sized
    cryptographic keys compared to the key sizes we use today, which will have implications
    for storage and scalability. There are redactable blockchains under development

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bitcoin celebrated its eleventh birthday on January 3, 2020\. It serves as our
    most visible example of the power of the ‘Internet of Value’. Built on blockchain
    technologies, Bitcoin’s tamper-resistant distributed ledger has remained intact
    despite its honeypot of value.**^(([i](#rfn_i)))** While Bitcoin comes from a
    community of cypherpunks and libertarians, traditional enterprises soon saw the
    threats and opportunities it posed. For the past five years, traditional enterprises
    across the globe have vetted blockchain technologies with thousands of proofs
    of concept, but mostly for private blockchain solutions. Live enterprise production
    deployments have been slow to come because ecosystem partners have to agree on
    standards, IP rights, shared governance, and business models. Early enterprise
    adopters show us the possibilities of the business and social value that can be
    created by sharing applications.

- en: 'In this book, we have examined numerous blockchain platforms and applications
    that are marching us towards an ‘Internet of Value’. Bitcoin; Ripple; Stellar;
    WeTrade; Sandander; and KoreConX show us that the future of financial services
    is upon us. The IBM Food Trust; EY’s WineChain; Everledger; GE’s TRUEngine; MediLedger;
    TradeLens; VeChain; and VeriTX illustrate asset authenticity and traceability
    through global supply chains. LO3 Energy and Share&Charge show us new markets
    for energy where individuals have platforms to share their excess energy capacity
    with other individuals. SmartResume shows us how to combine verified credentials
    with digital resumes to improve job markets. Each of these blockchain applications
    is a result of dedicated focus by founders and deep cooperation among ecosystem
    partners. Each was aiming to solve specific business and social problems that
    happened to be well-suited for blockchain technologies. The commonality across
    these contexts is this: ***Blockchain-based solutions are uniquely suited to verify,
    share and secure data for contexts that involve multiple trading parties who do
    not trust each other.*** Lack of trust does not mean one doubts the goodwill of
    trading partners; lack of trust means that one party is not willing to let another
    party execute agreements or to create or modify records pertaining to that agreement
    without verification. A well-designed blockchain application allows multiple parties
    to execute agreements as promised and to record, share and update transactions
    pertaining to those agreements safely.'

    state is that these solutions are happening at the application level, not at the
    infrastructure level. We are still missing universal components to realize the
    full vision for an ‘Internet of Value’. We have not yet realized the full power
    of individual self-sovereignty, asset/token transfers across chains, and a truly
    seamless and friendly user experience. But today we can more easily see the possibilities.

    upon the current, global COVID-19 pandemic, as the timing of my request for their
    thoughts happened in late March of 2020, when all of us were sequestered because
    of COVID-19\. When speaking more broadly—beyond the pandemic—the experts agreed
    that blockchain-enabled solutions are uniquely suited for inter-organizational
    contexts but require many people working together to drive standards and to develop
    workable governance frameworks. All concur that we need the power of blockchains

    five months later in May, the world has experienced unprecedented levels of devastation
    caused by COVID-19\. The pandemic has revealed the weaknesses in our supply chains,
    our inability to deploy resources where they are most needed, and difficulties
    in capturing and sharing the data needed to make rapid decisions. But the underlying
    problem is much larger than this single pandemic. COVID-19 is just a single, specific
    manifestation of the systemic risks caused by globalization. Global warming; income
    disparity; the rise of xenophobia; nuclear weapon armament; and the depletion
    of natural resources, are other manifestations. The world is so hyper-connected
    that what happens locally swiftly magnifies and spreads globally. It makes us
    feel uncertain and somewhat helpless. How can we surmount the seemingly insurmountable?

- en: 'Professor Ian Goldin from the University of Oxford and Dr. Mike Mariathasan
    from KU Leuven University, described the systemic risks of globalization in their
    provocative 2014 book, *The Butterfly Defect*. The authors wrote it after the
    2008 Global Financial Crisis, another pandemic—this time a financial one—that
    began in the US subprime mortgage market, and quickly spread worldwide. Their
    book title relates to Chaos Theory, which describes how small changes in initial
    conditions can have exponential consequences. The ***butterfly effect*** is based
    on the popular explanation of Chaos Theory: a butterfly flaps its wings (a small
    perpetration to initial conditions) and prompts a hurricane weeks later. The metaphor
    comes from Ray Bradbury’s short story *A Sound of Thunder*, written in 1952\.
    In Bradbury’s story, time travelers from the year 2055 go back 66 million years
    to hunt dinosaurs, but one hunter falls off the levitation path that prevents

    viability of blockchain is now clear, ubiquitous cross-industry adoption remains
    elusive due to a lack of common standards and governance models. In the short-term,
    we will see efforts focused on interoperability between similar enterprise platforms,

- en: Hopefully, readers by now have been given enough evidence to agree that something
    big is indeed afoot. Blockchains have the potential to change the way we exchange
    value, just as the Internet changed the way we exchange information. Blockchains
    show us new ways to mitigate counter-party risks, to provide reliable bookkeeping
    records, and to secure networks by using cryptography, digital tokens, consensus
    algorithms, distributed ledgers and smart contracts. It’s not just a pipe dream;
    public blockchains have over a decade of operations and a decent track record
    so far. When blunders like the DAO or a 51 percent attack occurs, we learn from
    them. Communities improve the technologies with each iteration of software development
    and upgrades. Private blockchains have a shorter history, but early enterprise
    adopters are proving the concept and realizing the value of sharing solutions
    across ecosystem partners.

    in parallel, converge, intersect, or otherwise have one supplant the other, remains
    uncertain. Early indications suggest that confidential (rather than anonymous)
    transactions over public blockchains may become the dominant model. Personally,
    I do not consider the public versus private blockchains as either/or options.
    As informed by General Systems Theory, ***equifinality*** is an inherent property
    of open systems, whereby an end state can be reached by many paths.^([13](#fn_13))
    In my opinion, the end state of an ‘Internet of Value’ will likely be public *and*
    private solutions; *and* hybrid solutions; *and* blockchain solutions that interface
    with existing systems of record. It’s not really about the technology anyway;
    it’s what the technology is ethically designed to do and the value it can deliver
    that keeps me—and hopefully readers—engaged.
