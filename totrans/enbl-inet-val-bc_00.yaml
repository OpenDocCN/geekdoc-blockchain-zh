- en: It is easy to imagine one of humankind’s earliest transfers of value happening
    over a campfire on a grassy plain or within a cave offering protection from the
    elements. One human passing food or clothing to another in exchange for something
    in kind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For most of humanity’s existence, transactions and the sharing of value were
    like this: payment delivered at the point of exchange; even long-distance transfers
    of money often involved the actual unit of value with coins or money crossing
    bodies of water via ocean liners or miles of the Old West on the backs of ponies.
    There’s a reason treasure hunters invest huge sums of money to explore ancient
    shipwrecks as gold coins still lay at the bottom of the sea where they sank in
    transit.'

- en: For centuries, goods, information, and stores of value all travelled in the
    physical realm, conveyed by people from one destination to another. The advent
    of the telegram broke that cycle with information able to travel far ahead of
    individuals. Today, information can bounce electronically around the world in
    seconds, free to access, and share with no restrictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, stores of value “even when represented as ones and zeros on an
    electronic ledger” are still subject to outmoded rules of transfer. Unable to
    move freely, traditional value must stop and start between countries and currencies.
    Like the hare in its race against the tortoise, speed remains unrealised, instead
    traveling in fits and starts on its way to its final destination.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This current day, yet thoroughly unmodern, the mismatch between the speed of
    transit for information, goods, and value persists because today’s payment systems
    were built for yesterday’s companies. Today’s companies like Amazon, Airbnb, and
    Uber need to make instant payments to customers, contractors, and small businesses
    around the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On its face, this is impossible because of the patchwork quilt of payment systems
    that cover the globe, each with distinct rules, processes, and currencies. To
    compensate, companies and providers must build bridges across these systems manned
    by payment teams that can sometimes grow to hundreds of employees. And to improve
    the speed of transactions, each bridge requires pools of money on either end in
    the local country’s currency to create liquidity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The end result is an enormous investment of cost and effort that is impossible
    for small companies or providers to match. This leaves the reality of instant
    value transfer over the world’s antiquated money networks the domain of only the
    largest and wealthiest organisations; today’s equivalents of the Medici family
    or other well-known financial brokers of the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a new reality for value is growing that has the potential to penetrate
    these walls and deliver a system of value that once again matches the speed at
    which goods and information can flow.

- en: Blockchain technology allows for trust-minimised systems without central operators,
    breaking the monopoly of those able to straddle disparate payment networks by
    virtue of their size and wealth. Paired with digital assets designed for cross-border
    transactions, blockchain-based systems can deliver instant transfers of value
    anywhere in the world.

- en: But we are not there yet. There are still missing pieces to the puzzle. Just
    as you require a specific address to send physical mail, a phone number to call
    someone, or an email address to send an email, so we all need unique digital wallet
    identifiers to send point to point value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the networks themselves still cannot work seamlessly in conjunction. Payment
    systems “whether traditional or blockchain based” have dozens of different methods
    of integration. We are still missing the Rosetta Stone for value the piece that
    will make it possible to unify all of these different networks.
