- en: '[Part III](#developing_smart_contracts_with_hyperle) is divided into Chapters
    [4](ch04.xhtml#smart_contract_development), [5](ch05.xhtml#smart_contract_invocation),
    and [6](ch06.xhtml#testing_and_maintenance). [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#smart_contract_development)
    covers the coding of smart contracts and the API libraries provided by Hyperledger
    Fabric for smart contract development. [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#smart_contract_invocation)
    applies that content to the invocation of smart contracts. Finally, [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#testing_and_maintenance)
    brings it all together as we explore maintaining and testing smart contracts.'
