    and larger stored data volume as the institution approaches closer to the central
    part of this structure. At the same time, they need to spend extensively on cooperation
    costs to maintain data accuracy in this decentralized system. Since Blockchain
    technology is decentralized, it can create a distributed and open network for
    banks, in which all transaction data will be transparent and shared by everyone.
    Distributed accounting based on Blockchain technology has the ability to remove
    invalid bank intermediaries and cut operating costs significantly.

    information be stolen nor the system influenced, as other nodes also store the

    win the bidding. Sometimes, even though they didn’t win the project, their bidding
    plans may be used in the follow-up constructions. What companies can do is to
    comfort themselves that what happens is just a coincidence. With Blockchain technology,
    however, all bidding information can be transparent, and only specific people
    have access to related records, which, to some degree, can curb corruption. Imagine

    serve as a bridge between many devices at low cost.

    Blockchain operations perfectly explain that process. As the foundation technology
    of Bitcoin, Blockchain makes accounting accessible to everyone involved in the
    network. In other words, all maintain their own identical copy of the ledger,
    but no one can delete or modify it, regardless of institution or individuals.
    Since Blockchain is highly transparent with great practical utility, could Blockchain
    and agriculture benefit each other by associating together in China, a vast agricultural

    the pilot is part of two separate but parallel pushes by Walmart and the Chinese
    government to make the supply chain data more accurate, and therefore safer. With
    an estimated $1 trillion to be saved by moving the global supply chain to Blockchain,
    Walmart stands to not only help China makes its food safer, but will cut corners
    on cost. IBM’s head of global supply chain solutions explained that “the pilot,

    a Walmart store, each item will have been authenticated using the Blockchain system

    The reason is that in the Blockchain system, the information for exchanging will
