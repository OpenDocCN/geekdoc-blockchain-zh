    that “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,”
    developed over the course of generations. More than a century earlier, in 1647,
    a group of religious dissenters in England called the Levellers pushed for what
    they termed an “Agreement of the People.” It called for freedom of religion, extensive
    suffrage, and equality under the law. And long before the Levellers, the Romans
    were working out these concepts as well. The Twelve Tables, from 450 BCE, sought
    to codify the laws of the day, to establish equality under the law between the
    ruling class and the common people. It wasn’t exactly the most enlightened set
    of laws—women were by law subject to men, and violent death was a common punishment—but
    it does show men trying to come up with a working set of rules that bound people
    within a civil society. Bitcoin, with its new model of decentralized governance
    for the digital economy, did not spring out of nowhere, either. Some of the elements—cryptography,
    for instance—are thousands of years old. Others, like the idea of electronic money,
    are decades old. And, as should be evident in Bitcoin’s block-size debate, Bitcoin
    is still very much a work in progress. The right conflagration of components that
    will allow this technology to be viable for the entire world is still being worked
    out.

    to how best to manage the kinds of economic and political tensions that have riven
    both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It must be said, though, that the foundational documents
    of Western democracy, including the U.S. Constitution, are having their relevance
    severely questioned in a rapidly changing, digitally interconnected world.

    In fact, even as these new online technologies are enabling borderless communities
    to operate somewhat beyond the oversight of traditional, geographically defined
    governments, they are also giving those governments new tools with which to exercise
    their power. Bitcoin and other systems governed by distributed consensus are built
    expressly not to have any one central point of control, in a deliberate effort
    to avoid giving centralized authority too much power. But other systems aren’t
    so egalitarian. The Snowden leaks showed how willing the U.S. government’s intelligence
    agencies are to use new machines that trace people’s ever-growing online trails
    to pry into their lives without their knowledge. Yet, for now at least, governments
    can also play a vital role in protecting our privacy. That can be found in the
    individual freedom principles that guide the best elements of Europe’s new General
    Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Americans, meanwhile, are learning what happens

    by Bitcoin and other manifestations of blockchain technology, we will be among
    the first to admit that, as currently designed, they don’t hold all the answers.
    The experience so far with Bitcoin itself has been one of narrowly concentrated
    wealth accumulation by the earliest adopters and by a small group of three or
    four large mining pools that control the bulk of the network’s computing power.
    A great deal of work needs to be done to scale the technology for Bitcoin, Ethereum,
    and other blockchain protocols in a way that lives up to the decentralization
    imperative. But as we’ve sought to emphasize, Bitcoin and the blockchain’s greatest
    contribution to the challenge of governance in the Internet age has been to change
    our way of thinking about society’s problems. Bitcoin and the blockchain have
    introduced a new model for confronting these obstacles. What matters most is the
    innovation and ideation that the blockchain concept has unleashed, primarily among
    software engineers and entrepreneurs, but also among political scientists and
    economists. As for the rest of us, we must demand a social and political framework
    that gives this open-ended inventive process the best chance of forging a system
    of open access and opportunity. And for that, we would contend that, whatever
    software system wins out, the common social goal of managing our trust relations
    should be significantly more decentralized and disintermediated. Given all the
    imagination and frenetic, open-source innovation that these ideas have unleashed,
    we don’t believe it is unreasonable or overly utopian to envisage that this approach
    can foster a better world.

    the cost of installing a network of computers to manage trust in a decentralized
    manner, then yes. If not, no.” Since a community must spend significant resources
    to prove transactions on a blockchain, that type of record-keeping system is most
    valuable when a high degree of mutual mistrust means that managing agreements
    comes at a prohibitively high price. (That price can be measured in various ways:
    in fees paid to middlemen, for instance, in the time it takes to reconcile and
    settle transactions, or in the fact that it’s impossible to conduct certain business
    processes, such as sharing information across a supply chain.) When a bank won’t
    issue a mortgage to a perfectly legitimate and creditworthy homeowner, except

    the question of whether doing so would level the playing field, of whether the
    existing centralized structure imposes unreasonable costs on users and limits
    the ability of innovators to introduce better ideas. As a reference point, we
    can go back to Teddy Roosevelt’s landmark anti-trust legislation at the start
    of the twentieth century, which gave us the lasting principle that it was in the
    public interest for the U.S. government to proactively enforce a competitive marketplace.
    The problem with that model, though, is that the industrial-era definitions of
    a monopoly don’t easily apply to the world of software and information networks,
    where value for the consumer is a direct function of network size and where the
    cost to the consumer is not paid in dollars but in valuable personal data. The
    dominant players, who argue that ongoing product improvements and “free” services
    represent a constantly improving customer experience, obscure the true exploitative
    nature of their business models, which combine secret, closed algorithms with
    the allure of an established network to limit the ability of competitors to challenge
    their dominant market position.

    not Facebook’s customer, you are Facebook’s product. In an age where everyone

    And some adventurous governments are open to the idea. By piloting a shareholder
    voting program on top of Nasdaq’s Linq blockchain service, Estonia is leading
    the way. The idea is that the blockchain, by ensuring that no vote can be double-counted—just
    as no bitcoin can be double-spent—could for the first time enable reliable mobile
    voting via smartphones. Arguably it would both reduce discrimination against those

    Well, in some cases, yes. We’ve already talked about how property titles could

    have their eyes on an even bigger goal, however, and hope to supplant what they
    see as a failed, obsolete model of nation-state–led government. The startup BitNation,
    for example, touts blockchain-based “world citizenship ID,” “embassies,” “nations,”
    and “allies” for online communities that create new models of self-government.
    The Bitcoin blockchain, its Web site argues, “allows us to choose to govern ourselves
    for the way we want to live now: peer-to-peer, more locally and globally.” To
    expect such ideas to gain traction on a large scale, at least at this stage of
    human history, is far-fetched. For one, they ignore the deep-seated role that
    our national legal systems play in our sense of justice. The law is a deep concept,
    ingrained into our collective and cultural thinking over centuries of development;
    most people won’t buy the illusion that “code is law” and won’t want to abandon
    that rich element of our social fabric for a software system they don’t understand.

    files around a network of independent computers so that they don’t reside together

    itself the Economic Space Agency, or ECSA. It takes some of its inspiration from
    cryptotokens, decentralized trust systems, and smart contracts, but its approach
    to decentralizing the economy and re-empowering individuals is very different
    from Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s. Rather than having every single transaction or
    smart contract instruction processed by the entire network of a single blockchain,
    ECSA has a bottom-up approach to decentralization. ECSA has a toolkit of programs
    called Gravity that builds on the decades-old “object capabilities” computer security
    work of Cypherpunk Mark S. Miller. Gravity allows computers in a local network
    to safely enter into smart contracts together. ECSA also emphasizes that communities
    should be able to autonomously set their own governance models. The idea, supported
    by an eclectic team of technologists, economists, political scientists, and anthropologists,
    is to empower people to build new “economic spaces” in which their communities
    can issue and trade cryptotokens in support of collaboration and cooperation.
    Unlike Ethereum, their transactions won’t need to be validated by a high-powered
    global blockchain network. Yet by allowing for trading and interaction across
    communities without the intermediation of a trusted third party, Gravity purports
    to be able to build, from this bottom-up starting point, an interoperable, decentralized

    of the nation. It manages property title records. It invests in infrastructure.
    It administers public savings and pension plans. And it ensures that funding goes
    to the judiciary and other agents of justice, as well as to universities and state
    research projects, all in a way that’s meant to be free from political influence.
    If it existed within a more dysfunctional political context, the Caisse des Dépôts
    could become a cesspit of corruption and an agent of political interests that
    would lose the trust of the people. But in France, it is considered a great honor
    to work for the Caisse des Dépôts. And that culture of honor helps build a deep
    wellspring of trust. The question here is: even if it’s possible to replace something
    like the Caisse des Dépôts with an algorithm that creates a system of distributed
    trust, would we want to? Might we undo centuries of cultural and social formation
    that goes into the creation of institutions like this?'

    exchanges and interactions—be they public bodies such as government agencies and
    courts or private entities such as notary publics and utility companies—similarly
    are products of centuries of society-building. The smooth functioning of these
    institutions depends not only on the systems of governance and jurisprudence we’ve
    developed to hold them to account but also on some vital cultural norms. With
    those mores in place, we willingly defer trust to these powerful gatekeepers at
    the same time that the people in charge of them routinely feel compelled to honor
    that trust. It’s an extension of the deep sense of civic responsibility that leads
    people to line up for things, to hold doors for strangers, or simply to say “please”
    and “thank you.” Institutionalized trust is a societal virtue, a form of social
    capital that’s in short supply elsewhere in the world. In those places where we
    have it, it’s not clear that we should be doing away with it. In each case where
    trust has been built up in this way, its value to society is arguably greater
    than the specific purpose that the institution plays.

    at least when dealing with strangers. But when applied more broadly, that maxim
    diminishes the core element of what brings a society together. It’s not for nothing
    that trust is seen as a positive thing and why early cryptographers’ descriptions
    of Bitcoin as a “trustless” system weren’t embraced by non-crypto folks. We should

    same act of computation, all validating the same transaction, identity assertion,
    asset transfer, or smart contract. Although their respective consensus mechanisms,

    claims can process millions of transactions a second; Tezos is reinventing governance
    to allow a more fluid, democratic system of ongoing blockchain protocol improvement;
    and Zcash and Monero are striving to resolve privacy concerns. There’s also James
    Lovejoy’s Cryptokernel project, whose K320 application addresses Bitcoin’s bugaboos
    of currency hoarding and the inequitable dominance of high-powered “ASIC” mining
    equipment. And to these you can add a project called Algorand, the sweeping new
    blockchain proposal from an MIT team including Turing Prize laureate Professor
    Silvio Micali, which addresses many of these challenges at once. If we assume
    that one or more of these can one day surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum’s adoption
    rate and at least match Bitcoin’s proven economic security—or, alternatively,
    that those two established blockchains end up incorporating their ideas—this process
    of invention is a source of great hope. Together they increase the likelihood
    that the global, digital economy can be managed by a decentralized trust architecture

    The complexity, and the overriding need for rock-solid security on a global level,
    mean that blockchain systems currently depend on highly specialized, deep knowledge.
    Without these specialists maintaining, updating, and de-bugging the core software
    protocols, the entire blockchain ecosystem could not function. As they are now
    designed, blockchains have an all-in-one mix of features, from cryptography to
    consensus algorithms, and demanding security features, all of which make them
    very clunky, complicated, and labor-intensive to work on. It takes a special type
    of software coder to deal with all of that.

    we’re still going to need to build up that pool of protocol developers. We’ll
    also need to tap this talent from the widest, most diverse swath of humanity—crossing
    gender, racial, and ethnic lines—so that the values and biases that are inevitably

    of decentralization. It relates to the foundational idea of citizenship. This
    book has explored ways in which individuals might, for the first time, be empowered
    as economic agents to exercise their rights to commerce, unhindered self-expression,
    and creative thought, and at the same time take charge of the property that’s
    rightfully theirs. Now, more than ever, this idea of a citizenship defined by
    these fundamental rights, an idea that began in the Enlightenment, hinges on control
    over information. How we govern information, the right to access and use it, will
    define the boundaries of freedom. That’s why the idea of an unbreakable truth
    machine that no one person or institution can break is so empowering.

    Government Office for Science on blockchain technology and its myriad uses. “The
    technology could prove to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to
    a wide range of services,” two members of Parliament, Matthew Hancock and Ed Vaizey,
    wrote in a foreword. “As we have seen open data revolutionize the citizen’s relationship
    with the state, so may the visibility in these technologies reform our financial
    markets, supply chains, consumer and business-to-business services, and publicly-held
    registers.” Then, further on, in a section entitled “Applications in Government,”
    Catherine Mulligan of the Imperial College London wrote that “the eventual impact
    of [digital ledger technologies] on British society may be as significant as foundational
    events such as the creation of Magna Carta.” That’s right. Magna Carta.

    Well, we’ve said elsewhere that the blockchain could represent the very first
    time that human society has a system for creating an unbroken historical record.
    We’ve also talked about what that might mean for the potential to end a millennia-old
    model in which power stems from control over our information. This is as important
    as ever now, with a U.S. president who believes he alone can define the boundaries
    of what constitutes “fake news” and publishes dubious official information that
    his minders describe as “alternative facts.” Seen from that context, the very
    prospect that we could build a truth machine—whether it resides on a blockchain
    or lives across a patchwork of Gravity-based economic spaces—is incredibly enticing.
    There’s something profoundly empowering about letting self-sovereign individuals
    record data to a publicly verifiable record, without requiring anyone’s permission
    to do so. If you’ve created something of value, such as a popular piece of digital
    art or an idea that could be translated into a profitable venture, it can be a
    game-changer if you can stake your claim to it without the approval of a business
    name registrar or some other certifying entity. That’s especially true for people
    in countries where such institutions are dysfunctional or don’t even exist. And
    when you add in the fact that this record can’t be destroyed, the possibilities
    become quite large indeed. Permanence of information is an essential component
    of democracy.
