- en: The ideas behind America’s Constitution, including its forceful opening declaration
    that “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,”
    developed over the course of generations. More than a century earlier, in 1647,
    a group of religious dissenters in England called the Levellers pushed for what
    they termed an “Agreement of the People.” It called for freedom of religion, extensive
    suffrage, and equality under the law. And long before the Levellers, the Romans
    were working out these concepts as well. The Twelve Tables, from 450 BCE, sought
    to codify the laws of the day, to establish equality under the law between the
    ruling class and the common people. It wasn’t exactly the most enlightened set
    of laws—women were by law subject to men, and violent death was a common punishment—but
    it does show men trying to come up with a working set of rules that bound people
    within a civil society. Bitcoin, with its new model of decentralized governance
    for the digital economy, did not spring out of nowhere, either. Some of the elements—cryptography,
    for instance—are thousands of years old. Others, like the idea of electronic money,
    are decades old. And, as should be evident in Bitcoin’s block-size debate, Bitcoin
    is still very much a work in progress. The right conflagration of components that
    will allow this technology to be viable for the entire world is still being worked
    out.

  zh: 美国宪法背后的理念，包括其有力的开篇宣言：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的，即所有人生来平等”，是在几代人的努力下逐渐形成的。早在一个多世纪之前，1647年，英格兰的一群宗教异议者称为平权派（Levellers）推动了他们所谓的“人民协议”（Agreement
    of the People）。它呼吁宗教自由、广泛的选举权和法律平等。在平权派之前很久，罗马人也在探讨这些概念。公元前450年的《十二表法》试图编纂当时的法律，建立起统治阶级和普通人之间的法律平等。这并不是最有见地的法律体系——女性在法律上受制于男性，暴力死刑是一种常见的惩罚——但它确实显示了人们试图制定一套在文明社会内约束人们的工作规则。比特币及其为数字经济提供去中心化治理模式的新模型也不是突如其来的。其中的一些元素——比如密码学——已经有数千年的历史。另一些，比如电子货币的概念，已经有几十年的历史了。正如比特币的区块大小争论所表明的那样，比特币仍然是一个正在不断发展的工作。允许这项技术在整个世界范围内可行的合适组件仍在努力开发中。

    Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Americans, meanwhile, are learning what happens

    by Bitcoin and other manifestations of blockchain technology, we will be among
    the first to admit that, as currently designed, they don’t hold all the answers.
    The experience so far with Bitcoin itself has been one of narrowly concentrated
    wealth accumulation by the earliest adopters and by a small group of three or
    four large mining pools that control the bulk of the network’s computing power.
    A great deal of work needs to be done to scale the technology for Bitcoin, Ethereum,
    and other blockchain protocols in a way that lives up to the decentralization
    imperative. But as we’ve sought to emphasize, Bitcoin and the blockchain’s greatest
    contribution to the challenge of governance in the Internet age has been to change
    our way of thinking about society’s problems. Bitcoin and the blockchain have
    introduced a new model for confronting these obstacles. What matters most is the
    innovation and ideation that the blockchain concept has unleashed, primarily among
    software engineers and entrepreneurs, but also among political scientists and
    economists. As for the rest of us, we must demand a social and political framework
    that gives this open-ended inventive process the best chance of forging a system
    of open access and opportunity. And for that, we would contend that, whatever
    software system wins out, the common social goal of managing our trust relations
    should be significantly more decentralized and disintermediated. Given all the

    comes at a prohibitively high price. (That price can be measured in various ways:
    in fees paid to middlemen, for instance, in the time it takes to reconcile and
    settle transactions, or in the fact that it’s impossible to conduct certain business
    processes, such as sharing information across a supply chain.) When a bank won’t
    issue a mortgage to a perfectly legitimate and creditworthy homeowner, except

    the question of whether doing so would level the playing field, of whether the
    existing centralized structure imposes unreasonable costs on users and limits
    the ability of innovators to introduce better ideas. As a reference point, we
    can go back to Teddy Roosevelt’s landmark anti-trust legislation at the start
    of the twentieth century, which gave us the lasting principle that it was in the
    public interest for the U.S. government to proactively enforce a competitive marketplace.
    The problem with that model, though, is that the industrial-era definitions of
    a monopoly don’t easily apply to the world of software and information networks,
    where value for the consumer is a direct function of network size and where the
    cost to the consumer is not paid in dollars but in valuable personal data. The
    dominant players, who argue that ongoing product improvements and “free” services
    represent a constantly improving customer experience, obscure the true exploitative

    ECSA has a bottom-up approach to decentralization. ECSA has a toolkit of programs
    called Gravity that builds on the decades-old “object capabilities” computer security
    work of Cypherpunk Mark S. Miller. Gravity allows computers in a local network
    to safely enter into smart contracts together. ECSA also emphasizes that communities
    should be able to autonomously set their own governance models. The idea, supported
    by an eclectic team of technologists, economists, political scientists, and anthropologists,
    is to empower people to build new “economic spaces” in which their communities
    can issue and trade cryptotokens in support of collaboration and cooperation.
    Unlike Ethereum, their transactions won’t need to be validated by a high-powered
    global blockchain network. Yet by allowing for trading and interaction across
    communities without the intermediation of a trusted third party, Gravity purports
    to be able to build, from this bottom-up starting point, an interoperable, decentralized
    global economy.

    claims can process millions of transactions a second; Tezos is reinventing governance
    to allow a more fluid, democratic system of ongoing blockchain protocol improvement;
    and Zcash and Monero are striving to resolve privacy concerns. There’s also James
    Lovejoy’s Cryptokernel project, whose K320 application addresses Bitcoin’s bugaboos
    of currency hoarding and the inequitable dominance of high-powered “ASIC” mining
    equipment. And to these you can add a project called Algorand, the sweeping new
    blockchain proposal from an MIT team including Turing Prize laureate Professor
    Silvio Micali, which addresses many of these challenges at once. If we assume
    that one or more of these can one day surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum’s adoption
    rate and at least match Bitcoin’s proven economic security—or, alternatively,
    that those two established blockchains end up incorporating their ideas—this process
    of invention is a source of great hope. Together they increase the likelihood
    that the global, digital economy can be managed by a decentralized trust architecture
    that is open, permissionless, and dynamic yet also more manageable, scalable,
    secure, and safe for the environment.'

    The complexity, and the overriding need for rock-solid security on a global level,
    mean that blockchain systems currently depend on highly specialized, deep knowledge.
    Without these specialists maintaining, updating, and de-bugging the core software
    protocols, the entire blockchain ecosystem could not function. As they are now
    designed, blockchains have an all-in-one mix of features, from cryptography to
    consensus algorithms, and demanding security features, all of which make them
    very clunky, complicated, and labor-intensive to work on. It takes a special type
    of software coder to deal with all of that.

    as a whole is to have a say in how this new economic governance system evolves,
    we’re still going to need to build up that pool of protocol developers. We’ll
    also need to tap this talent from the widest, most diverse swath of humanity—crossing
    gender, racial, and ethnic lines—so that the values and biases that are inevitably
    baked into the algorithms that rule our lives don’t come from an overly narrow

- en: Yet there’s something more fundamental than financial stability behind the value
    of decentralization. It relates to the foundational idea of citizenship. This
    book has explored ways in which individuals might, for the first time, be empowered
    as economic agents to exercise their rights to commerce, unhindered self-expression,
    and creative thought, and at the same time take charge of the property that’s
    rightfully theirs. Now, more than ever, this idea of a citizenship defined by
    these fundamental rights, an idea that began in the Enlightenment, hinges on control
    over information. How we govern information, the right to access and use it, will
    define the boundaries of freedom. That’s why the idea of an unbreakable truth
    machine that no one person or institution can break is so empowering.

    Government Office for Science on blockchain technology and its myriad uses. “The
    technology could prove to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to
    a wide range of services,” two members of Parliament, Matthew Hancock and Ed Vaizey,
    wrote in a foreword. “As we have seen open data revolutionize the citizen’s relationship
    with the state, so may the visibility in these technologies reform our financial
    markets, supply chains, consumer and business-to-business services, and publicly-held
    registers.” Then, further on, in a section entitled “Applications in Government,”
    Catherine Mulligan of the Imperial College London wrote that “the eventual impact
    of [digital ledger technologies] on British society may be as significant as foundational
    events such as the creation of Magna Carta.” That’s right. Magna Carta.

- en: How, exactly, is this record so important from a constitutional perspective?
    Well, we’ve said elsewhere that the blockchain could represent the very first
    time that human society has a system for creating an unbroken historical record.
    We’ve also talked about what that might mean for the potential to end a millennia-old
    model in which power stems from control over our information. This is as important
    as ever now, with a U.S. president who believes he alone can define the boundaries
    of what constitutes “fake news” and publishes dubious official information that
    his minders describe as “alternative facts.” Seen from that context, the very
    prospect that we could build a truth machine—whether it resides on a blockchain
    or lives across a patchwork of Gravity-based economic spaces—is incredibly enticing.
    There’s something profoundly empowering about letting self-sovereign individuals
    record data to a publicly verifiable record, without requiring anyone’s permission
    to do so. If you’ve created something of value, such as a popular piece of digital
    art or an idea that could be translated into a profitable venture, it can be a
    game-changer if you can stake your claim to it without the approval of a business
    name registrar or some other certifying entity. That’s especially true for people
    in countries where such institutions are dysfunctional or don’t even exist. And
    when you add in the fact that this record can’t be destroyed, the possibilities
    become quite large indeed. Permanence of information is an essential component
    of democracy.

    of love notes, of messages of peace and hope, and of straightforward statements
    that so and so had visited that place—the classic “I Was Here” proof of existence,
