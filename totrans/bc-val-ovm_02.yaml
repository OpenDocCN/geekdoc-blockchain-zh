    (PaaS) or blockchain Platform-as-a-Service (bPaaS), involves the use of cloud
    tools and services to develop blockchain applications. Large companies like IBM
    and Oracle provide an ecosystem of tools for other companies to utilize blockchain
    technology. The final product often operates similar to more familiar platforms
    under those larger companies, such as Office 365, [Salesforce.com](http://www.Salesforce.com),
    Google G Suite, Dropbox, or Slack.

    up a full blockchain system is prohibitively high for many. As a small enterprise,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain-as-a-Service adds an element of centralization to the blockchain.
    For this reason, blockchain purists argue that BaaS is not technically a blockchain
    at all but a more evolved distributed database. One commentator says, “It’s a
    centralized product — buying it is just like buying a cloud service.”

    an end-user, to focus your attention and resources on the actual functionality
    of the blockchain and the problem it is designed to solve, rather than the issues
    that inevitably arise when building a blockchain solution from scratch.[2](11_ch02.xhtml#ch02en2)

    chain. From the time the olives are pressed into olive oil, they’re tracking the
    lifecycle of the olive oil. You can scan the barcode on one of their bottles and
    get information about where the olives came from, like the name of the farm and
    processing plant. They now have this ability to give a lot more information to
    customers.

    and form the Global Shipping Business Network consortium. They’ve got some of
    the largest carriers and shippers and forwarders who are working together to put
    information on blockchain to create much more transparency and eliminate errors.
    For example, the carrier and the port terminal operators must know about the safety
    of the goods being shipped. Are the items dangerous (e.g., corrosive, radioactive,
    can catch on fire or explode)? Because if they are, they’ve got to be handled
    uniquely and placed in a certain part of the ship.

    using blockchain technology to track all the information that’s contained in these
    documents.[23](11_ch02.xhtml#ch02en23) One of the reasons is that when there are
    errors or discrepancies in the documents, there are potential delays, extra fees,
    and fines. If the carrier or the shipper doesn’t handle things properly it can
    delay the inspection and ship leaving the port, or container being cleared through
    customs. The customs or the port may impose extra fees or a fine on the carrier
    or the shipper. These blockchain records also help with a dispute resolution.

    that the information is accurate, and that you can track and trace items. That’s

    on a frequent basis using at-home or wearable devices and share any abnormal readings
    on the blockchain monitored by the distributed care team so they can determine
    if an immediate response is required. Ability to provide and record an audit trail
    of near real-time notifications to all the doctors, nurses, and others participating
    in the patient’s care is part of the value of using blockchain.

    access to information because our electronic healthcare records right now are

    to control and authorize access to their records by various third parties such

    each party has a different view of it. For example, if I order a bunch of goods,

    Maybe it comes in multiple sets of shipments. And if I have a separate system,

    If so, you’re going to have to have interoperation to make sure various blockchains

    to do cross-ledger transfers. This is true within Hyperledger Fabric. It’s also
    true between Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. We’re going to have to solve this
    problem. But as an industry, we’re still quite a way away from having the right
    solution toward interoperability.

    those. We’ve been doing that for decades. Decentralized applications we’ve been
    doing only a few years. We don’t have deep knowledge, we don’t have the design

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Individuals and businesses are increasingly adapting blockchain technology for
    a variety of uses. However, the technical complexities still deter mass adoption,
    and the costly operational overhead in creating, configuring, and operating the
    blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure does not help. Along with well-known
    technology enterprises, many of whom offer favorable prices, many start-ups offer
    a viable solution to this problem through the BaaS model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BaaS lowers the barrier to entry for the use of blockchain technology and may
    enable enterprises to experiment, evolve, and create better solutions. Soon, there
    may be rapid growth in adopting blockchain solutions for businesses. This will
    spurt an innovation drive that will influence possible use cases of blockchain
    for the benefit of industries as well as consumer ecosystems in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BaaS seems to have numerous advantages. The predictable, low costs may give
    users an edge. For many BaaS providers, costs will generally be based on a monthly
    billing model, and they so far seem mostly affordable. Also, BaaS industry has
    the talent that can handle the underlying blockchain technology service. There
    are capable staff and developers ready to handle initial configuration and infrastructure
    maintenance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, projects using BaaS can be rapidly scaled up or down with relatively
    low risk and at your own pace. Furthermore, there is a high level of data and
    information security. BaaS providers can pool resources to move and store data
    with far more protection than a company acting alone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet, BaaS may have drawbacks. By hosting a blockchain on a single provider,
    you may wonder whether the benefits of centralization are worth the risks and
    whether you are truly taking advantage of blockchain capabilities. The data may
    be kept on the provider’s property and governed by its policies. You may not own
    this network and may be required to simply trust those who do. You have limited
    control and, while dependent, pay more for these services. While upfront costs
    tend to be low, the long-term costs of using BaaS may be more expensive than self-hosting.
