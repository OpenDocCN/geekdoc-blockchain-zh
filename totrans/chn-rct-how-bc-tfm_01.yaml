    will succeed and when? Why do some innovations seem to explode onto the scene
    while others build slowly? Why are some innovations credited with making the world
    a better place, while others seem to create new problems faster than they solve
    old ones? These aren’t easy questions to answer, which is why venture capitalists
    spread their risk across a wide array of innovations rather than relying on the
    instincts of a small number of entrepreneurs.

- en: While we may not be able to predict which innovation will succeed, there are
    some principles that help us understand what success is and isn’t. Let’s begin
    at the point where an innovation has been developed, has found some early adopters
    and has made its first tentative steps towards commercialization. It is at this
    stage that many innovations tend to get stuck, while others spread rapidly and
    disrupt existing industries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To move beyond this initial phase, an innovation must be “good enough” to meet
    the needs of a particular market. Innovations tend to attract wider adoption when
    the new thing is good enough to replace the existing thing. The new doesn’t need
    to replicate all the features of the existing. In fact, the new will tend to be
    much better in some new attributes, while only minimally effective in other attributes.^([1](#Fn1))
    One key driver for innovations to encroach upon the existing is the market environment.
    Alternative systems can take root faster and with less overhead the less developed
    the status of existing systems.

    only to thrive in the developing world—perhaps most famously in the case of mobile
    money. M-Pesa, first launched in Kenya in 2007, is one of the earliest and best-known
    mobile money wallets. Starting first as a means to make payments using Nokia-type
    handsets, M-Pesa has inspired multiple similar operations throughout the developing
    world, particularly among lower-income users where bank account penetration is
    low.^([2](#Fn2))

    to raise their hand if they’d used mobile payments in the past month. At that
    time, nobody in a lecture theater in the US or the UK had used mobile payments.
    In fact, the first time that I used a mobile wallet in my daily life in London
    was because I’d left my physical wallet at home. The same question asked across
    Africa or parts of Asia would have triggered an almost unanimous show of hands.'

    launched in June 2007, a month before the iPhone. When M-Pesa really took off
    in 2011, using mobile money was still a pretty awful experience. The rich mobile
    app experiences the iPhone would ultimately create had yet to take over our wallets.
    Mobile money at that time was based on exchanging credit balances held by the
    mobile network, not a bank. It didn’t generate interest or benefit from any sort
    of deposit protection. Users were unable to get credit, as with a credit card.
    Transactions were cumbersome and clunky, effected through sending texts with complicated
    transaction codes to direct the movement of funds. Why would someone with access
    to a credit card or a bank account use a system that had fewer benefits than a
    bank and was more difficult to use than a credit card?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer lies in the concept of being “good enough.” While mobile money was
    much weaker than the system of credit cards, it had attributes that made it much
    more attractive in developing countries. For one thing, you didn’t need a bank
    account or credit history—services that are hard to come by in rural Kenya, particularly
    for informal workers lacking the right documents. For merchants, point-of-sale
    terminals for credit cards at the time required a physical telephone connection,
    a costly piece of infrastructure that could take weeks or even months to install;
    M-Pesa was accessible using the Nokia or equivalent basic phone that every merchant
    already had. Faced with constant risk of robbery, M-Pesa provided an attractive
    alternative to carrying and storing cash. These features—no bank account, credit
    history or landline required, and less need to carry cash—were more highly prized
    in the developing world, enabling mobile money, as clunky as it was, to grow and
    thrive.^([3](#Fn3))

    shape mountains set against the Li River, I found myself in a restaurant with
    little cash, only credit cards. I presented them one by one as my server shook
    her head. “Cash or WeChat,” she repeated. In the hope of sparing me a long night
    of washing up, the server took me to every shop and restaurant in the street to
    see if they would take payment by my Visa or Mastercard, and then transfer my
    payment by WeChat to the restaurant. Half an hour and 25 vendors later, we returned
    to the restaurant. I promised to come back the next day with cash. Not one vendor
    accepted credit cards, only WeChat.'

    of China’s institutions and expansive economy, platform developers mashed mobile
    money with messaging, e-commerce and other digital trends—the most defined example
    being WeChat. This one platform represents a Cambrian explosion of multiple innovations
    (most incubated in more developed economies) coming together as one. No platform
    in the US, UK or other developed markets has come close to replicating the breadth
    of features offered by WeChat, nor the rate of penetration WeChat enjoys within
    the Chinese economy.^([4](#Fn4)) Both WeChat and Alipay now even have versions
    accepting payment via Visa or Mastercard for foreign visitors.

    existing ones. Amazon and the broader e-commerce industry is quickly encroaching
    upon bricks and mortar retail in the US and other western economies, particularly
    since the coronavirus lockdowns. However, physical retail is not going away entirely.
    Even Amazon is opening physical stores. Why? Because what is evolving is no longer
    a binary bricks vs. clicks. What is developing is more an interplay between the
    emerging system and the incumbent. What is afoot is a reordering of the features
    that consumers value. Brand experiences are more important than direct in-store
    sales. For instance, you can buy an iPhone at your local Apple store, but that
    is not its main function; rather the store is a venue where anyone can have an
    Apple experience. It is designed to appeal to non-customers as much as customers.'

    additional productivity in developing countries as in advanced economies, despite
    the fact that they were rolled out much later in the developing world. To understand
    why, consider the system that mobiles replaced in the US compared with India,
    for example. Before mobiles, Americans would fumble for change at a pay phone
    or wait to go back to their home or office to make a call. In rural India, someone
    without access to a fixed-line phone might have to travel for hours for a conversation.

    field among developed and developing economies alike. Fishermen in the US Gulf
    of Mexico have a long history of using radio to work out which harbours to dock

    in the Bay of Bengal to do the same.^([5](#Fn5))

    can skip intermediate technology (landline telephony) and move straight to cutting
    edge tech. Mobile money is proving to be a similar case for financial inclusion
    in countries underserved by their banks. While banks in developed countries are
    closing branches to adapt to online banking, developing countries are able to
    deepen their financial systems, skipping the buildout of nationwide branch banking
    systems all together. The leapfrogged economy is freed of the operating and capital
    cost of offsetting the legacy system.^([6](#Fn6))

- en: Leapfrogging has occurred throughout post-industrial history, and before. Going
    back to the nineteenth century, railways were built in the richest countries long
    before poorer ones, but they provided a bigger incremental improvement in developing countries
    that lacked a pre-existing system of long-distance roads and canals. Where such
    networks existed, railroads offered higher capacity and speed. Where canal systems
    and major roads had not been constructed, trains opened the possibility of long-distance
    overland transport for the first time.

- en: In the same way that prior to mobile and railroads, telephone and transportation
    infrastructure was weaker in developing countries, today’s equivalent lies in
    transactions infrastructure—the networks of accountability and trust that connect
    economic activity. Institutions of trust—the holders of public records such as
    land registries and licensing agencies—tend to be weaker in the developing world.
    Institutions are frequently less reliable, more cumbersome to use or, indeed,
    non-existent.

    economies, developing countries are far from homogeneous. The World Bank Enterprise
    Surveys show that 11% of firms in Italy experience bribery requests, a great deal
    more than in many developing countries, such as Turkey, Chile or Georgia. In European
    Union member state Hungary, firms expect to pay bribes amounting to 14.1% of the
    value of the contract to secure government work, more than in every country the
    World Bank surveys apart from Timor-Leste and Sierra Leone. Overall, though, about
    a quarter of firms operating in emerging and frontier markets report experiencing
    bribery requests, compared to less than 1% in developed countries.^([7](#Fn7))

    more fundamental impact in places where there is a less entrenched way of doing
    things. The World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys show that around a third of firms
    in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, and half of those in South Asia improved
    their processes from the prior year. In high-income countries, less than 7% had

    novel combination of technologies to address this issue.^([10](#Fn10)) Trust between
    total strangers was to be achieved by combining elements of computer science,
    cryptography, game theory and economics. It created a paradigm within which participants

    encompasses all of what many people would correctly refer to as distributed ledger
    technology or “DLT,” being any networked system that has distributed record keeping
    and allows all users within the system to verify data. In this sense, a blockchain
    is essentially just a shared database. This extends the scope of discussion to
    systems and technologies where information is open and searchable in a shared
    ledger, even if they don’t have some of the elements needed to meet purist definitions

    advanced economies are frequently compromised by inaccessibility, under-funding,
    opacity and corruption—characteristics that undermine their role as arbiter of
    truth. Against this backdrop, the new paradigm of transparency made possible by
