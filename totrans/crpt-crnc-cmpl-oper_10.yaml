    which investors can learn more about a potential investment. We will discuss these
    procedures in more detail in this chapter but on a high level they can range from
    simply asking basic questions about a potential investment’s characteristics,
    to very detailed forensic level analysis of particular aspects of an investment
    being considered. In a cryptocurrency context it should also be made clear that
    due diligence can be performed by investors on a wide variety of different crypto
    assets including direct investments in cryptocurrencies, non-fungible token (NFT)
    investments and allocations to cryptocurrency fund managers.

    ODD is the process of detecting and evaluating operational risk. Operational risk
    refers to, “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
    people and systems, or from external events.”[¹](#FPar1) The term business risk
    is also sometimes utilized to refer to operational risk. Coming from the world
    of alternative investments, operational risk has turned into a broad catch-all
    category for LPs to bucket all other risks that do not directly relate to the
    investment function of a fund. It should be noted that while in practice, there
    is overlap between the analysis of operational risk and investment areas of fund
    manager however, this classification of risks into investment and operational
    buckets is still useful in order to guide an LP’s review toward the framework
    by which certain risks are analyzed. In the crypto space, this same broad operational
    risk definitional analysis framework is applied much the same way it is in the
    alternative investment space. Operational risk considerations in a crypto context
    can take on a wide variety of different forms. These are prevalent in both direct
    crypto investments as well as through investments in third-party crypto asset
    managers.

    with direct crypto and digital asset investments. For example, an investment in
    a particular cryptocurrency may have operational as a result of the underlying
    technology and blockchain protocols supporting the particular coin or token. For
    example, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (BSV) suffered a 51% attack in August 2021
    which led to a significant price decline in BSV and an estimated drop in the hashrate
    of almost 50%.[²](#FPar1) This is an example of operational risk because the decline
    in BSV is not as a result of the investment merits of BSV itself but rather from
    operational factors underlying the cryptocurrency.

    in Non-Fungbile Tokens (NFT). An example of an NFT art situation in which operational
    risk played a role was the August 2021 launch of COVIDPunks based on the CryptoPunks
    NFT project. The COVIDPunks project featured, “*10,000 randomly-generated Punks on
    the Ethereum network. Each Punk is wearing a programmatically-assigned, W.H.O-approved mask,
    and has special pandemic-themed metadata that affects its background color and rarity*.”[³](#FPar1)
    When COVIDPunks launched users lost over 174 ETH, valued at approximately $490,000
    at the time, in failed transactions while trying to mint their own COVIDPunks
    NFTs.[⁴](#FPar1) Investors cannot recoup this money because Ethereum gas fees
    are non-refundable. These type of losses have nothing to do with the investment
    merit of the COVIDPunks but rather represent an operational risk of trying to
    make such an investment. Therefore, these could be classified as operational risk
    losses.

- en: Another NFT art-related example of operational risk relates to access the purchases
    of NFTs through marketplaces such as OpenSea. There have been many instances reported
    where an individual makes a purchase of an NFT but then finds they cannot access
    or view the artwork. In these types of cases the NFT itself remains in existence
    on the blockchain, typically Ethereum, but different platforms for can chose to
    no longer display access to it. This leads to a situation where a person cannot
    view the NFT they purchases. There are a variety of reasons this can occur including
    copyright violations, reusing stolen artwork and violations of a marketplace’s
    terms of usage.[⁵](#FPar1) Once again this type of situation represents NFT operational
    risk because there is an impact on the value, and even accessibility, of the digital
    investment for reasons outside of the pure investment merits of the NFTs.

    the nature of the fund’s specific investment strategy (i.e. – investment due diligence),

    investors employ one of our different ODD models. These are the dedicated, shared,
    modular and hybrid models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dedicated - An ODD framework where an investor’s organization has at least one
    employee whose full time responsibility is vetting the operational risks at hedge
    fund managers.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shared - An operational due diligence approach under which the responsibility
    for reviewing the operational risk at a crypto fund is shared by the same individuals
    who have responsibility for investment due diligence, and there are not any dedicated
    ODD resources.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modular – Under a modular framework the ODD process is classified into functional
    components. These individual components are then spread out among individuals
    throughout the investors organization each of which has unique domain-specific
    knowledge. It is important to note that in a modular operational due diligence
    framework, these domain experts typically have other responsibilities within the
    larger investment organization that reach outside of the ODD work. An example
    of this would be an investment allocation organization with a Chief Technology
    Officer (CTO) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In a modular ODD framework, the
    work of these domain experts is often pieced together by an individual or group
    of individuals which we will refer to as an ***operational generalist***. The
    operational generalist can be thought of as an information aggregator who pieces
    together the disparate functional reviews completed by the domain experts to facilitate
    the LP organizations progressing toward arriving at an ***operational risk conclusion***.
    The operational due diligence duties of the operational generalist can be very
    similar to those of operational due diligence analysts under a dedicated framework
    and can include such things as on-site manager visits and operational risk report
    generation. Under a modular framework the operational generalist or group of individuals
    performing the operational generalist function can either be a dedicated operational
    due diligence professional (i.e. - fitting into the definition of the dedicated
    approach) or the operational generalist(s) themselves can serve other functions
    within the organization and may even be domain expert(s) in their own right. An
    example of this would be a COO who has other responsibilities within the LP’s
    organization, yet who also serves as the operational generalist piecing together
    the operational due diligence work of the functional domain experts.

- en: Hybrid - A hybrid ODD approach encompasses some combination of the three previously
    described approaches (dedicated, shared, modular). An example of a hybrid framework
    would be an LP’s organization that would have a full time ODD analyst (i.e. -
    dedicated framework) while leveraging off other in-house domain experts as needed.
    Continuing this example, these domain experts would not be a part of the standard
    operational due diligence review process followed by the LP (i.e. - such as a
    modular approach) but utilized on an ad-hoc basis. Another example of an operational
    due diligence framework which would befall under the hybrid classification would
    be an LP that outsources the operational due diligence function, either in part
    or entirely, to a third-party operational risk consultant.

- en: The use of different ODD frameworks to analyze operational risk in crypto asset
    managers, is related to a concept known as an ***operational veto***. When an
    operational veto is executed, this means that an investor, or the appropriate
    decision mechanisms such as an investment committee, has decided that they will
    not be allocated to a crypto asset manager primarily on the basis of operational
    risk considerations present. The way operational vetos can be distinguished from
    ODD frameworks, is that these different ODD models do not address which individuals
    or groups at an LP’s organization hold the authority to make the ultimate operational
    conclusion regarding a particular crypto asset manager. Furthermore, these style
    buckets do not address which individuals or groups, such as an investment committee,
    has the final authority to make the final allocation decision to a crypto asset
    manager.

- en: It is also considered best practice for the investor ODD process to include
    a review of the legal and associated offering documentation related to the specific
    crypto fund vehicle being considered for investment. It is important to clarify
    that certain investors may have their third-party legal counsel conduct a review
    of the legal documents which some may assume obviates the need for a secondary
    investor ODD review. In practice however, the purpose of these two reviews are
    generally different in nature. The lawyer reviewing the legal docs related to
    the investors proposed investment in the crypto fund is doing so focused primarily
    through the lens of legality. For example, the lawyer reviewing the crypto fund
    documentation is attempting to determine if there is anything in the fund docs
    which would be a potential violation of law, or something that would violate the
    investors fiduciary obligations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A secondary purpose of the lawyers review is focused on negotiation. In this
    instance, the lawyer is trying to determine if there are any terms in the fund
    offering documents that should be negotiated to be more advantageous to their
    client, the potential investor in the crypto fund. Some examples of the types
    of items that investors commonly seek to negotiate with crypto fund managers can
    include fund performance and management fees, notification provisions for specific
    investment-related limits that may be of concern to a particular investor, investment
    level transparency and reporting provisions and key person provisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The review of fund legal documentation by a lawyer differs from the review of
    the same documentation conducted by an investor during ODD in that the focus of
    the review is different. The primary purpose of the ODD review of the legal documentation
    is to focus on making an operational risk assessment of the fund terms and other
    associated considerations as outlined in the documentation. While an ODD review
    may overlap with the lawyers review in terms of general assessments of legality
    and negotiation, this is not the focus. For example, let us consider if a crypto
    asset manager’s legal documentation does not provide for a key person clause.
    A key person clause typically allows for investors to make redemptions of capital
    without penalty and during periods when they would otherwise not normally be allowed
    to because the portfolio manager of the fund or other key personnel, have become
    uninvolved in the fund through a prolonged absence such as a severe incapacitating
    illness. It is not illegal for a crypto asset manager not to have a key person
    clause, but it is certainly considered advantageous to investors for such a clause
    to be present. As such, the ODD review may raise this issue where the legal review
    might otherwise not have.

    regard to previous education and employment in particular, the extent to which
    LPs may be able to verify this information may also depend on the cooperation
    of the GP. In many countries, the subject under investigation (i.e. – the key

    or a former employer to release information about them to a third party. This
    would include even the most basic information such as confirming that they attended

    may vary among different providers. For example, if an LP hires a third-party
    firm to simply perform a criminal investigation, different firms may offer different
    levels of services as to what that category actually covers. For example, one
    consultant may offer a lower level of coverage and fee that a simple summary of

    diligence process and this trend has continued into the crypto space. Unfortunately,
    very similar to the hedge fund space, a key reason for this has been a series
    of outright frauds.. For reference case studies of notable crypto hacks and frauds
    were presented in Chapter [8](513667_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml). Although many of the
    crypto frauds may not have been to as large as scale or as brazen as they include
    the Madoff fraud, the Bayou Hedge Fund Group fraud and the Galleon insider trading
    case, the crypto hacks and frauds have still caused significant concerns for investors.
    While many that have continued to plague the crypto space increase in operational
    due diligence has been a series of high profile operational failures and frauds,
    many of which have been in the hedge fund industry with notable examples of unfortunate
    cases. Some of the more notable crypto frauds have included the 2014 Mt. Gox hack
    with over $460 million stolen from Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mr. Gox and the
    2018 over $500 million dollar hack of Japanese firm Coincheck. There have also
    been a continued series of lower profile cases that have continued to remind investors
    to focus on operational due diligence.

    pervasive skepticism surrounding the security and reputation of crypto related
    investments. Many of these concerns are rooted in the traditionally black cloud
    that has hung over the crypto space where the use of crypto assets such as Bitcoin
    has been thought of to be primarily utilized by criminals on dark web portals
    such as Silk Road to conduct criminal activity. Recent studies have shown that
    these associations continue to over represent the criminal ways in which cryptocurrencies
    are utilized.[⁶](#FPar1) As an example, a series of studies conducted by Chainalysis
    showed that in 2019 criminal activity represented only 2.1% of all cryptocurrency
    transaction volume, or approximately $21.4 billion in transaction volume. In 2021,
    a revised Chainalysis study showed that this number has continued to decrease
    with the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity falling to only 0.34% or
    approximately $10 billion in transaction volume.[⁷](#FPar1)

    and criminal activity involves the use of crypto in ransomware payments. Ransomware
    attacks are common cybersecurity attacks where criminals install software on a
    computer or network that locks the legitimate users out of the system until a
    ransom is paid. Due to the speed and anonymity associated with cryptocurrencies
    increasingly cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are the ways in which the criminals
    require payment for their ransom. A May 2021 ransomware attack by the criminal
    organization the DarkSide group on Colonial Pipeline caused damage to America’s
    supply of gas and resulted in the payment of nearly $5 million in cryptocurrency
    to the group to unlock the compromised systems.[⁸](#FPar1) These types of attacks
    and the association have continued to reinforce not only increased concern among
    LPs allocating to crypto hedge funds, but also among regulators as well. Even
    before the Colonial Pipeline attack, in 2020 the U.S. Treasury Department in conjunction
    with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed enhanced rules
    that would require banks, exchanges and other dealing in cryptocurrencies to undertake
    enhanced compliance measures to better verify the identities of individuals attempting
    to withdraw or resend cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on unhosted wallets.[⁹](#FPar1)
    This type of evolving regulatory uncertainty, coupled with the increasing of ransomware
    attacks to a level quadruple that of 2019 has continued to motivate those LPs
    seeking to allocate to the crypto space to devote more resources toward their
    crypto ODD procedures.[^(10)](#FPar1)

    diligence should not be interpreted to imply that there is necessarily cause for
    concern among all crypto managers. Instead, investors that are devoting more time
    and resources toward performing not only investment due diligence but checks in
    these other areas are demonstrating that they are taking a prudent approach toward
    learning lessons from mistakes that managers have made in the past. Additionally,
    this increased due diligence allows investors to test and verify that a crypto
    fund manager is employing sound operational practices, is being truthful about
    their background and does not have any potentially damaging reputational surprises
    they are hiding. By performing these types of enhanced ODD and investigative checks,
    investors ultimately have more conviction in their investments. This results in
    what is known as ***sticky capital***. It is called this because in general if
    investors spend more time upfront on due diligence, then once they make an investment,
    they are less likely to redeem their capital very quickly and hence the capital
    is thought of as being stuck or difficult to come to lose from the manager.

    and private equity rooted ODD related practices of outsourcing the investigative
    process to a third-party firm that focused only on background investigations.
    As referenced above, today it is increasingly common for investors to not separate
    the investigative due diligence process from the ODD process, but rather to integrate
    them. In many cases, increased familiarity with more common reputation and background
    issues can often help to provide LPs with a benchmark by which they can better
    compare findings.

- en: One area that often serves as a good example of this relates to litigation.
    A crypto asset manager may be involved in litigation as part of normal course
    of their investments. This litigation is not necessarily that of the type which
    many investors would consider to be negative from a reputational perspective.
    One way combining the ODD and investigative due diligence processes can provide
    due diligence efficiencies is if investors need clarification regarding this type
    of litigation and to help better distinguish whether or not a particular legal
    action for example, may be negative in nature. During operational due diligence
    LPs are dealing directly with the crypto asset manager directly. This ODD and
    investigative due diligence process integration removes the need to re-approach
    crypto GP's for background investigation issues. Additionally, as outlined above,

    digital asset, their due diligence process primarily consists of conducting research
    through a wide variety of venues including such as by following those that work
    for the crypto project on Twitter and reading news they produce, reading the cryptocurrencies
    white papers, reading industry publications and attending conferences.

    process should cover the three categories of due diligence outlined above (i.e.
    – investment, operational and investigative). The general steps followed by investors
    in implementing this process are slightly different for each category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In terms of the ordering of the categories, investment due diligence is commonly
    undertaken first ahead of any operational or investigative due diligence. The
    motivation behind this rationale is because if a crypto asset manager would fail
    to pass muster for a potential investor, then there is no need to devote the additional
    resources to conducted operational and investment due diligence. The actual process
    of undertaking investment due diligence on a crypto asset manager is very similar
    to the investment due diligence process for a direct crypto investment. Key steps
    in the investment due diligence process that an investor would undertake include:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key area that investors have devoted increased due diligence resources to
    in the crypto space is in the areas of custody. *The* *term* ***custody*** refers
    to the process by which crypto assets are stored in a secure and documentable
    manner. When the cryptocurrency industry was first getting started, a large number
    of crypto investors held self-custody of assets in cold wallets such as on their
    personal computers or on portable hard drive type wallets. The motivation for
    this was largely due to the belief that crypto investments should support the
    decentralization of financial services. These types of solutions were not very
    secure solutions in the sense that an individual’s home computer is susceptible
    to failure or being hacked. Furthermore, cold storage wallets may be lost or stolen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, there can be a simple case of where a user misplaces or simply
    forgets the password to their wallet. This risk eventually led to the development
    of pneumonic seed phrases so that users could utilize these phrases in an attempt
    to allow them to remember their passwords but once again this is not a fool proof
    system. For all of these reasons, institutional investors are increasingly skeptical
    of self-custody solutions. An alternative to self-custody is for a crypto fund
    manager to employ a hybrid solution that is sometimes referred to as a wallet
    plus solution. These types of wallet plus arrangements involve the use of hardware
    wallets but with additional security measures layered on top of them. Examples
    of these additional security measures could include two-factor authentication
    protocols as well as the requirement for multiple signatories, as administered
    by a third party, prior to any transactions occurring in the wallet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another type of custody model that can be employed by crypto fund managers is
    an entirely third-party custody solution. Third-party custody models are well
    established for other alternative investment vehicles such as non-crypto hedge
    funds and private equity funds. Hedge funds that are increasingly investing in
    the crypto space have embraced the traditional third-party custody model for crypto
    assets with over 52% of crypto hedge funds employing a third-party custodian as
    of 2019, and anecdotal evidence suggest this number has steadily increased as
    more institutional LPs have focused on crypto asset custody during the ODD process.[^(12)](#FPar1)
    For reference custody and the role of custodians is discussed in more detail in
    Chapter [3](513667_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These third-party custody solutions have increasingly been made easier to implement
    through the use of linked custody solutions by crypto exchanges such as Gemini
    and CoinBase. These crypto exchanges already can provide investors with web-based
    hot wallet solutions. These hot wallets allow for the storage of coins owned by
    crypto funds at wallets hosted by the exchange. This would be as opposed to purely
    cold wallet storage. Third-party custodian models meet the more traditional established
    standards of non-crypto hedge fund and private equity institutional level custody.
    Due to the enhanced risks of hacks allowing for the virtually anonymous stealing
    of crypto assets once they are transferred to new wallets, crypto third-party
    custody solutions are increasingly mirroring the security measures employed by
    offsite business continuity and disaster recovery sites utilized by hedge funds.
    These types of hardened facilities allow crypto fund managers to store the physical
    keys to the cryptocurrencies and digital assets, often with a high level of security.
    The hardware devices utilized to maintain crypto keys and wallets are often highly
    specialized security devices such as hardware security modules (HSMs) the most
    secure of which are subject to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
    security ratings.[^(13)](#FPar1)

- en: Outside of investments in cryptocurrencies themselves, in other spaces of the
    crypto universe in spaces such as DeFi, pure self-custody and quasi self-custody
    solutions may still be utilized by crypto asset managers due to a lack of support
    for newer or evolving DeFi projects and related coins. In these types of situations
    investor due diligence becomes increasingly important. This is in large part due
    to the fact that once the current custody solution employed by the crypto fund
    manager is analyzed and the risk level diagnosed, then the investors can work
    in a consultative manner with the crypto asset manager to determine if any alternative
    custody arrangements are available which would still facilitate the fund manager’s
    investment process while minimizing the investor’s operational risk exposure in
    the area of custody risk.

    and digital asset-related investments. We began with an overview of the three
    categories of crypto due diligence on a crypto asset manager: investment, operational
    and investigative. As part of this discussion, we discussed common areas covered
    during the investment due diligence process including analyzing crypto investment
    strategy and fund risk statistics. Next, we turned to a review of the common goal
    of the operational due diligence (ODD) process that includes unique considerations
    applicable to both cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We also discussed
    common operational due diligence models employed by investors in crypto funds
    and the items typically covered during a crypto ODD review. Next, we discussed
    the investigative due diligence process as well as the increasing trend of combining
    the operational and investigative due diligence processes. We concluded the chapter
    by discussing unique consideration for cryptocurrency custody solutions during
    the due diligence process.'
