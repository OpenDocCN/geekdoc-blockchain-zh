    a regulatory gray area, especially with respect to securities law regulations.
    While the issuance of many blockchain-based tokens is likely to fall within the
    scope of securities laws, many grassroots projects or start-ups will have difficulty
    bearing the regulatory burden of these laws—with regard to the disclosure requirements,
    the asymmetries of information surrounding these investment tools, and the current
    lack of accountability or redress for retail investors. At the same time, access

    which represents a fundamental and necessary component of the ecosystem with which
    it is associated, and the issuance of an app coin (short for application coin)
    that may have some functionality similar to loyalty points or be used in lieu
    of cash payment to use services. The difficulty with such app coins is that, in
    many cases, they rely on a thin economic rationale, often merely serving as a
    disguise to fund the development of a blockchain-based application designed around
    a private profit center—acting, in effect, as a security token by other means.

    token. We overview different practices adopted by various projects involved in
    a token sale, and investigate the regulatory approaches taken by existing regulatory
    authorities. We focus, in particular, on the SEC and how its thinking has evolved
    in the past year. We give specific attention to the interpretation of the Howey

    blockchain-based tokens as a fundraising tool.

    have to navigate murky waters. Some projects engage in a series of complicated
    techno-legal solutions in order to adapt their business practices and technological
    design to conform to the intent of existing regulations. These solutions try to
    take advantage of regulatory exemptions in various jurisdictions, with specific
    requirements that—if met—would allow securities issuers to reduce their regulatory
    obligations. Others continue to take the view that true utility tokens should
    be exempt altogether from securities laws, although it is becoming increasingly
    difficult to conduct such sales to the public.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    designed to comply with these different regulatory frameworks. The most common
    of these practices include the creation of nonprofit foundations acting as the
    umbrella organization that issues the tokens (e.g., the Swiss foundation model
    introduced by Ethereum) or the elaboration of specific contractual arrangements,
    such as the SAFT model, introduced by Filecoin. Yet, most of these solutions require
    extensive overhead while still bearing significant regulatory risks and uncertainty,
    and are often limited to specific exemptions under securities laws that do not
    enable token issuers to benefit from the full opportunities of a token sale.

    mechanism for the decentralized web, and analyzes the inherent tension in privately
    funding a public good. We refer here to private funding as funding coming from
    various private sources rather than from government, NGOs, or public institutions,
    which are more centralized funding sources. Private funding is more decentralized;
    however, it is currently caught up in the mental models of Web 2.0, where entities
    extract and monopolize private network value.

    value of shares based on the expectation of revenues and profit in the private
    enterprise. As such, equity is an appropriate tool to fund private profit centers,

    Dapps emerging in the Web 3.0 landscape.

    for these platforms?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advent of the token sale or ICO was an attempt to resolve the tension inherent
    in the private funding of public goods. An ICO consists of the practice of offering
    blockchain-based tokens for sale to the public, and using the collected funds
    to support the development of a blockchain-based platform or Dapp—which, once
    deployed, will become publicly available to all tokenholders. Fundamentally, the
    idea is that if we are building a public good, then we should let the public who
    will benefit from this good fund it.

  prefs: []

    in the commons to gain access to them. Accordingly, ecosystem tokens are often
    required for accessing network resources, used as a means to pay transaction fees
    between network nodes, or employed as other internal accounting and payment mechanisms.
    Participants who contribute to the ecosystem may also be rewarded in ecosystem
    tokens, for example, by running validator nodes or otherwise building network
    infrastructure or applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for validator nodes to confirm on-chain transactions and maintain network security
    that is tied to network value, rather than the profit value of specific applications
    that utilize a particular blockchain. The value of a true ecosystem token captures
    value across multiple profit centers in the network and all possible future profit
    centers, without necessarily taking on specific enterprise risk in any particular
    profit center.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This kind of economic incentive does require secondary market trading in order
    to decentralize its allocation and provide liquidity to validator nodes, allowing
    them to realize the value of their contributions to the network. Furthermore,
    using cryptocurrencies like ether and bitcoin would be inadequate as an incentive
    model. These cryptocurrencies have price movements that are entirely exogenous
    to, and independent of, the network value; a node validator wishing to earn ether
    or bitcoin would simply mine those blockchains instead. It would also be overly
    capital-intensive for new protocols to use ether and bitcoin as the reward mechanism.
  prefs: []

    and products that meet end-user demand, increases demand for access to the network
    and, consequently, the demand for ecosystem tokens. If all else is equal, then
    this increased demand results in an increase in the value of the tokens. Therefore,
    ecosystem tokens align individual incentives with those of the public commons.
    Individuals must, in effect, obtain tokens to access the network and participate
    (both individually and collectively) to build the value of the ecosystem—for instance,
    by contributing to the core network architecture and infrastructure, or by building
    Dapps that enhance the utility value of the ecosystem.

    release cautioning the industry that the use of blockchain technology does not
    exempt token issuers or exchanges from the need to respect existing laws and regulations
    designed to protect investors and market integrity.¹⁸⁶ Specifically, the report
    stated that the sale of digital assets (or tokens) by decentralized block-chain-based
    organizations, such as the DAO, could very well qualify as a securities offering
    and thus be subject to the registration and disclosure requirements of federal
    securities laws.

    of ICO practices, the SEC focused most of its legal analysis on the DAO. Although
    it determines whether a particular token qualifies as a security on a case-by-case
    basis, the SEC focused on the DAO to illustrate the application of securities
    laws to the issuance of blockchain-based tokens in the context of “virtual organizations”
    more generally.

    SEC applied the Howey test, a test from a US Supreme Court case (SEC v W.J. Howey
    Co., 328 US 293) used to determine whether an investment contract implicates US
    securities laws. As the Court in Howey determined, an investment contract requires
    (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation
    of profits (4) to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of
    others. All elements must be met for a security to be found, thereby implicating
    securities laws and regulations.

    the Attacker exploited a weakness in the code and removed investor funds, Slock.it

    In the case of the DAO, a variety of people, including the Slock.it team, contributed
    to building up the value of that ecosystem (thereby also increasing the value
    of the token associated with that ecosystem). Yet, following the SEC report, it
    appears that, if an identifiable team is marketing a potential investment to the
    public and the public is entrusting confidence in that team to galvanize the community,
    then the team’s efforts will necessarily fall within the “managerial efforts”

    of the SEC. Munchee indeed was not an ecosystem as we have defined it above, since
    its goal was not that of building an open network of open-source tools upon which

    Munchee’s argument that the token was integral to the function and internal economy

    was first used to manage the proceeds of initial crowdfunding transactions aimed
    at funding the development of new blockchain-based networks or applications. In
    2014, Ethereum was the first blockchain project to establish its foundation (Stiftung
    Ethereum) in the Swiss canton of Zug. Soon followed by other block-chain-based
    projects, the Ethereum Foundation laid the cornerstone of “Crypto Valley,” self-described

    According to our discussions with several law firms in Switzerland, FINMA (the

    a price floor and price ceiling, whereby—contrary to the Bitcoin economics of
    fixed supply—the token supply may fluctuate to keep within price boundaries. As

    that token purchasers may otherwise have. Any low-enough ceiling can prevent pumps-and-dumps’

    mechanism than some broad-based economic definition of inflation.

    easy to do, since it requires automatically issuing new tokens at the ceiling
    price whenever there is demand. However, guaranteeing a floor level may not be

    raise the floor price if doing so would make it unable to purchase all of the
    tokens at the floor price.”²¹⁹

    While there is merit to a true ecosystem token sold to core ecosystem stakeholders
    for maintaining and developing common resources, in early-stage fundraising, distinguishing
    between the development of a networked ecosystem and the deployment of a Dapp
    operating on top of that ecosystem might be difficult. In other words, the difference

    the underlying public rails is often theoretical and unclear.

    classical debt or equity financing instruments. This model would be analogous

    of nonprofit software foundations (e.g., the Linux Foundation), and for-profit
    companies commercializing particular products or services related to open-source
    software (e.g., the Red Hat company that distributes and commercializes an operative

    compensation for open-source IP development), which would not run afoul of any
    securities law regulations. The private enterprise could focus on a particular
    vertical or business application of the ecosystem, or be a for-profit incubator
    for other Dapps in the ecosystem—thereby kick-starting the ecosystem development.

    to tokens through the balance sheet of the private enterprise. In effect, the
    value of the ecosystem tokens represents the value of the private enterprise’s
    contribution toward the open-source IP. Unlike traditional proprietary IP, which
    is often a start-up’s core asset, the ecosystem tokens sitting on the balance

    people seem to think today. While currently a large majority of ICOs have been
    done at the preproduction phase (i.e., at the seed level), we argue that it is
    very difficult—both for an ecosystem token and for an app coin—to avoid securities
    laws and regulations if a token is sold before its associated blockchain-based
    platform or decentralized application is built.

    system and might therefore have a greater chance of being regarded as a utility
    token. However, the current SEC guidance with respect to the Howey test seems
    to confirm the idea that selling a token with an actual or potential utility does
    not constitute, as such, a sufficient condition to preclude it from being sold
    as a security. We must also take into account how tokens are marketed to the public
    and why people are buying them.

    reduce or eliminate speculative opportunities over the appreciation of their tokens
    (e.g., by making the tokens nontransferable or by creating a low-ceiling token
    price cap), they need to devise new approaches to ensure that the tokens being
    sold do not qualify as securities. While the SAFT (and the related SAFTE) is an
    interesting proposition for achieving that goal, the SEC will likely not accept
    its logic, post-Munchee.

    the platform has been deployed and an ecosystem has emerged around it, will the
    utility emerge and the value inherent in these tokens become apparent to all.
