- en: The blockchain concept relies on cryptography that links the blocks and each
    block holds the cryptographic hash of a previous block and timestamp along with
    data to be transferred. The openness in the distributed setup is achieved with
    the help of a peer-to-peer network. The main idea is that the need for central
    trusted third party is obsolete. Each node, another name for block, possesses
    a complete replica of the blockchain. Adding a new transaction, that is, adding
    a block, ensures that block is appended to all blocks such that transparency is
    maintained. Tampering with data is not possible, and the working of a system is
    flawless when integrated with blockchain technology. Cryptographic arrangements
    help in increasing the security of the transaction in any sort of application.
    The type of restriction blockchain is broadly classified into public, private
    and consortium. The blockchain provides reliable, immutable, irrevocable, transparent
    data available at all times, with reduced costs because a third party is not required.

    measures to curb traffic congestion that leads to over-pollution. So the issue
    of smart mobility becomes a nightmare for almost all governments across the globe.
    The defined government may provide a framework and handle mobility for their public
    transport since they might have complete information about mobility. However,
    this kind of centralized system is limited to government-approved transport and
    mobility services only. All the urban areas across the globe have huge unaccounted
    highly dynamic private vehicular mobility about which centralized traffic management
    cannot make any prediction. This added mobility issue will make the estimates
    of centralized public transport systems imprecise, and hence the citizens may
    be frustrated with inaccurate prediction results by the so-called centralized
    mobility management systems. It is quite common that many nations have well-regulated
    public rail and road transport services, and there are several web and mobile
    applications running presently to address the needs of smart mobility. But the
    significant thing is this kind of application mostly does not take into account
    a sudden outburst of private unpredictable traffic which may defeat the purpose
    of the smart mobility features incorporated in place.

    we are supposed to follow blockchain technology insurance companies. The Estonian
    government has taken a step to improve health care in the commercial sector and
    the government sector. The Estonian government created an innovation strategy
    that implements the blockchain technology in the whole country. They demonstrated
    how the process works in govtech partnerships. The population of the country year
    by year increases and places greater demands on the health care system. Not only
    is demand rising but the cost of the medicines is also increasing. In order to
    solve this problem, Estonia introduced an innovative plan in 2011 with a technology
    called blockchain in govtech partnerships. In this method a proprietary keyless
    signature was introduced in blockchain to ensure the security of the records,
    and it authorizes the availability of parties also. This blockchain-based health
    care records system has some benefits like its scalable, secure record system.
    Because of its distributed nature blockchain can easily share data only with authorized
    parties. The data auditing method was improved by the blockchain because blockchain
    records are immutable.

    if any third party person requires big data, it will set permission to access
    those third parties. Nowadays medical industries work based on value-based business;
    this will help to prevent the diseases, change each and every person’s lifestyle,
    identify infections, etc. In order to manage the complexity of health care sector
    data, analytics tools help to smooth the process as well as improve the efficiency
    of the medical practice and make workflow accurate. Here blockchain technology
    starts with one trusted ecosystem especially for decision making, and this blockchain
    involves a timestamp that helps to authenticate dataset changes; this ability
    provides the permission to manage the electronic health record data for one user
    or more than user if they edit any document purpose. Previously patients were
    not able to share their personal data but now they can share their data securely
    with even new members because here the blockchain technology used as authentication
    with a timestamp that makes more secure about patient record details. In this
    type of approach if any patient’s data are lost or crash in the sense automatically
    bulk of data that was crashed, those data will be updated soon as well as if any
    of the attackers attack those data at last the attacker may get a message called
    failure or rejection because this whole system conditions verified by multiple
    system conditions. Even though we are using the current technology to enable or
    keep data very secure or maintain privacy a little bit of difficulty. When we
    use big data technology that helps to keep data security also sometimes we can
    break personal data. For such issues, blockchain is one possible best fit model.
    When we divide our data into so many categories big data with blockchain provide
    security to the users as well as to hospital management (Shilpa et al., 2018).
    In the past all records were created in handwritten format only. But now a new
    trend has evolved in health care to generate reports as well as data in the format
    of the digital chart. This new method of electronic medical records and electronic
    health records replaces the old method anticipated paper chart creation and cumbersome.
    To keep electronic records secure, one protocol helps which is based on the HIPAA
    Security rule. This protocol protects health records from virus attacks, making
    records confidential. There are two different methods used to secure data in blockchain;
    one is the Mooti model, and the other model is the Enigma model. The Mooti model
    in blockchain keeps data secure and gives access only to those who are authenticated
    users; the Enigma model organizes entire medical health records which include
    private information across a distributed network, and only the party owner can
    decrypt (Daniel et al., 2017).

    health care sector. This method is based on a framework that gives an efficient
    and fraud-free solution to the insurance claims. This framework is designed based
    on permissionless blockchain, an open source called “Ethereum”. This process of
    authentication depends on the involvement of various parties over the network.
    Involving blockchain in health insurance decreases the amount of time and cost
    required for processing. There are technical challenges. In order to overcome
    these, blockchain cannot solve the data standardization problem but can provide
    a data share method in real time only in the trusted network. In this type of
    blockchain (Health Insurance) initially tested three types of nodes in a framework
    that was created earlier. The blockchain framework is Ethereum solidity v4.0.31
    but contracts were written. Experiment setup requires Ubuntu 64 bit, Intel i5
    processor and RAM, 15.6 GB with 15 Mbps of local area network speeds. After successful
    completion of experiments, Ethereum gives results like different confirmation
    time for the different networks as well as smart contracts and is different from
    the Ethereum framework. While implementing this proposed method the same framework
    is used with the help of IPFS for different applications in the same framework
    environment (Sravan et al., 2018).

    again it lacks in offering standards in terms of making a system more reliably
    secure as well as providing authentication to the users and preserving the data
    for a long time. In India deploying blockchain in public services is a big challenge.
    Some of the states in India have started to adopt blockchain-based IT in their
    state services. This creation of blockchain-based health care and making it a
    public service may be challenging, but when compared to the above process, the
    health information or health records of the patient’s are brought into important
    changes in the health public sector concern; records or information has been criticized
    on account of the centralization process. The problem in the public sector to
    develop blockchain in all the places is due to the lack of platform availability;
    this is the major reason why we were not able to develop across the country. However,
    when we try to develop means the cost will be high. A security system in the blockchain
    is another criterion while developing in the public sector. This security system
    requires the following type of security data security (records, information):
    Physical security, user-provider key-secret key security and risk management.
    The above types of security ensure trustworthiness of records or information which
    is stored in the health care sector (Navadkar et al., 2018).'

    turning into an important issue around the world. Blockchain technology is generating
    significant interest across a wide range of industries in India. The use cases
    and blockchain fit assessment have also been performed for some banking transactions.
    Every bank and financial office needs to perform the KYC method one by one and
    transfer the valid data and documents to the central register. By using a unique
    ID, banks can access the stored data to perform due diligence whenever customers
    request a new service within the same banking relationship or from another bank.
    Having explained about the need for blockchaining in banking and finance, what
    are all the solutions offered by the blockchaining, uses cases or processes where
    the blockchaining can play a key role? The main benefits of blockchaining are
    that it’s near real-time, i.e. the blockchain technology enables near real-time
    settlements of recorded transactions, removing friction and reducing risk. The
    next benefit is that there is no intermediary, i.e. blockchaining technology is
    based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two parties to transact
    directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. The next
    benefit of blockchaining is irreversibility and immutability, i.e. the blockchain
    contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made.
    This prevents past blocks from being altered and in turn stops double spending,
    fraud, abuse and manipulations of transactions (Jani, 2017).

    that create and maintain the user account. Sound identity management and governance
    are needed to manage identities for online services. Identity management is needed
    to alter the user provisioning method, enabling new users to get access to online
    services and de-provisioning users to ensure that only the rightful users have
    access to services and data. Identity management is classified into different
    types, and they are independent IDM, federated IDM and self-sovereign IDM. In
    independent IDM, users do not know their identity record and it can be revoked
    or misused by the identity provider. In federated IDM, users’ accounts are managed
    independently by an identity provider and no enterprise directory integration
    is required. In self-sovereign IDM, users should be able to control their own
    identity. The discovery of this new mechanism creates a secure platform for service
    providers to authenticate users who do not have a single entry of failure and
    prevents attacks and leakages of user data. Blockchaining identity management
    and authentication solution by design are decentralized and distributed, which
    decreases the deployment and maintenance cost. On the other hand, instead of premise
    deployment of the blockchain network, blockchain as-as service (BaaS) permits
    consumers to go ahead with cloud-based solutions to construct, host and make use
    of their own applications and smart contracts with blockchain.

    to reduce the burden of almost all the government activities significantly. This
    may lead to total virtual governance in which the entire administrative machinery
    can discharge its duties without any manual intervention that can be audited at
    any time for any reason. The permissive blockchain and stateless blockchain, when
    combined suitably, may lead to a fully democratic government in which there is
    no central power of authority, totally eliminating corruption, bias and over-exercising
    of power. Also, the cost of running government activity would be slashed drastically
    that may in turn benefit the people of the country by heavily reduced direct and
    indirect taxes. This will lead to most of the money earned by the government for
    the reduction of unemployment and other social welfare schemes. In another 20
    years, many fast-growing countries may join the developed nation bandwagon due
    to this disruptive technology.
