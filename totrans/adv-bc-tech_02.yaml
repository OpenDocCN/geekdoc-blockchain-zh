- en: The concept of “blockchain” became widely known in 2009 with the emergence of
    the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and relatively recently, the prospects of blockchain
    application in other areas began to be discussed. Blockchain is a technology of
    storing and processing data in a chain of blocks in computer networks, which does
    not refer to any particular domain [[1](#CR1)]. Each block in the chain can contain
    arbitrary data, including production processes, which allows describing the possibilities
    of using this technology in production systems [[2](#CR2)].

  zh: “区块链”概念在 2009 年因加密货币比特币的出现而广为人知，而最近，区块链在其他领域的应用前景开始被讨论。区块链是一种在计算机网络中存储和处理数据的技术，它不指涉任何特定领域
    [[1](#CR1)]。链中的每个区块都可以包含任意数据，包括生产过程，这使得可以描述在生产系统中使用该技术的可能性 [[2](#CR2)]。
- en: The growth of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Industrial Internet of Things
    necessitate the resolution of several data interchange and processing issues,
    including storage, access, security, and so on. Furthermore, there is a contemporary
    trend toward developing distributed systems rather than centralized ones. One
    of the most essential characteristics of the Internet of Things is its nodes’
    autonomy and capacity to interact with one another [[3](#CR3)]. This is a service-based
    interaction in which specialized nodes deliver services to other nodes in the
    network. Some blockchain implementations use a smart contract mechanism to enable
    such interaction.

  zh: 物联网技术和工业物联网的增长需要解决若干数据交换和处理问题，包括存储、访问、安全等。此外，当今趋势是开发分布式系统而不是集中式系统。物联网最重要的特征之一是其节点的自主性和彼此交互的能力
    [[3](#CR3)]。这是一种基于服务的交互，专门的节点向网络中的其他节点提供服务。一些区块链实现使用智能合约机制来实现这种交互。
- en: A smart contract is a self-executing script that is stored with other data in
    the blockchain. Each smart contract has its algorithm written in a specific programming
    language and automatically conducts any activities without the involvement of
    other parties. A smart contract monitors the fulfillment of specified circumstances
    and, using the given algorithm, takes choices based on them. Because every network
    member may sign a contract, this mode of engagement extends to Internet of Things
    nodes. This technique creates a dependable environment for transferring network
    nodes and makes services visible and uniform. Furthermore, because all contracts
    are already maintained in blockchain, there is no need to construct a separate
    service registry [[4](#CR4)].

  zh: 智能合约是存储在区块链中与其他数据一起的自执行脚本。每个智能合约都有其用特定编程语言编写的算法，并自动执行任何活动，无需其他参与方。智能合约监视指定条件的实现，并根据给定的算法做出选择。因为每个网络成员都可以签署合约，所以这种参与模式扩展到物联网节点。这种技术为转移网络节点创建了可靠的环境，并使服务可见且统一。此外，由于所有合约已经在区块链上维护，所以无需构建单独的服务注册表[[4](#CR4)]。
- en: Blockchain technology is highly general; many of its applications are now employed
    in various domains of human activity [[5](#CR5)]. To effectively use all of the
    benefits of blockchain technology for developing CPS and the Industrial Internet
    of Things, it is required to design the ideal blockchain network topology based
    on the tasks to be done and select the most relevant tools (software and hardware).

- en: A cyber-physical system (CPS) results from the integration of computation with
    physical processes. On the other hand, some argue that it is a system that combines
    environmental elements with the computational part. Data acquired from the environment
    and actions in the environment correspond to the environmental elements. From
    the moment there is a translation of data from the environment into the digital
    world, it is the responsibility of computing to handle this data. CPSs monitor
    and control the physical world, with the possibility of having sensor networks,
    as well as associated actuators [[6](#CR6)]. Thus, this type of systems depends
    on the synergy between physical and computational components. On the other hand,
    and unlike traditional embedded systems, the CPSs emphasize a holistic view of
    the system, that is, it is seen as a whole, and not only as several isolated modules.

    are rigidly bound to the cryptocurrency utilized in one or more global blockchains.
    Changes in exchange prices in the cryptocurrency market are nearly hard to foresee,

    A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” signed by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto,
    was published. It described the theoretical foundations for creating a new generation
    of electronic currency: decentralized, transparent, and independent of central
    banks and regulators [[8](#CR8)]. However, it was not widespread and in the first
    months it was discussed in academic circles – among cryptographers, mathematicians,
    and programmers. Bitcoin, the world’s first blockchain, which is the embodiment
    of the concept of this article, was launched on January 3, 2009, and has been
    successfully functioning for almost 10 years. Several thousand blockchains have
    emerged during this time, replicating bitcoin with minor variations and bearing
    little resemblance to its progenitor. Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity is still unknown,
    as he stepped away from bitcoin development in 2010 and has never revealed his
    name or even the country where he lives. Researchers and journalists have put
    forward many theories about Satoshi, but none have been confirmed. There have
    also been many imposters who have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but not one
    of them has been able to provide sufficient evidence to back up their claims.
    To date, the public is likely to accept only one way to confirm Satoshi’s identity:
    ownership of bitcoins he mined in 2009–2010\. Satoshi is credited with more than
    a million bitcoins, which have never come to fruition except for a few test transactions
    sent to prove the blockchain is working. In particular, Satoshi sent the first-ever
    10 BTC blockchain transaction to the famous cryptographer Harold (Hal) Finney,
    who was actively involved in the discussion of the theoretical foundations of
    bitcoin. However, while all the glory of creating bitcoin as the world’s first
    workable blockchain undoubtedly belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, the blockchain did
    not emerge as an isolated discovery that appeared out of nowhere, from nowhere.
    In fact, blockchain is the result of the synthesis of several trends in information
    and financial technology, united by the insights of Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever
    he may be. Among the technologies and solutions from which bitcoin and blockchain
    emerged are commonly cited:'

    Finney）发送了有史以来第一笔10 BTC的区块链交易，后者积极参与了比特币理论基础的讨论。然而，尽管毫无疑问地，创造比特币作为世界上第一个可行的区块链的荣耀归于中本聪，但区块链并不是一项孤立的发现，毫无征兆地出现。事实上，区块链是几个信息和金融技术趋势的综合产物，是由中本聪的见解所团结起来的，不管他是谁。比特币和区块链出现的技术和解决方案中，通常被引用的有：

    development (although an entry fee must be obtained). If a transaction has been
    approved, it is added to the bitcoin blockchain; otherwise, it is removed. To
    maintain transaction security and integrity, a variety of cryptographic techniques
    are employed. At the moment, bitcoin is the most popular public blockchain system
    on the Internet. Bitcoins are created in exchange for the processing of each transaction,
    according to the software source code. Users (miners) use their computing power
    to verify, save, and guarantee transactions and burn them into the blockchain.
    This work done by miners is called Proof of Work (PoW) and consists of solving
    algorithmic problems that are part of the bitcoin protocol. Once the transaction
    is validated, it is time-stamped, added to the blockchain, and is then visible
    to the recipient and all members of the network. The blockchain described above

    ability to participate in transactions and the verification tasks are both determined
    by an organization. There is a private network with a predetermined number of
    nodes, such as a blockchain of location, described in the literature. A cryptography-based
    technique is not required in a private blockchain. There are no miners, no Proof
    of Work, and no monetary reward on a private blockchain. These are the primary
    differences between public and private data storage and transmission systems (public

    an instance of blockchain access and transaction software. The wallet can run
    on almost any electronic device with an operating system, including a server,
    PC, laptop, or smartphone. A blockchain wallet has similarities to online banking,
    which provides access to money in a bank account. Still, the blockchain user has
    sole and complete control over their money and can independently start any number
    of wallets without providing personal information or documents to any organization.
    At the same time, the user is solely responsible for all actions with the wallet,
    and all technical and legal problems he will have to solve. The blockchain circulates
    virtual units of account, which can be used as money or perform certain technical
    functions. These units have the same name: bitcoin (bitcoin, BTC, from “bit,”
    a minimal unit of information, and coin, a coin) in the bitcoin system. Because
    bitcoin was conceived as the electronic equivalent of gold, cryptocurrency monetary
    units are commonly referred to as coins. At the same time, the broader term “token,”
    long used in IT systems and games, is now used for nonfinancial blockchains. As
    blockchain systems became more complex and tiered networks emerged, more or less

    and anyone who receives a copy of that key will have the same power in the blockchain
    as the owner of the original wallet. Therefore, the security of private keys requires
    the highest level of security possible. Hacking into the bitcoin network from
    the outside is now virtually out of the question, as its reliability has been
    confirmed by many years of operation. However, individual hacking wallets or centralized
    services that handle cryptocurrencies and tokens cannot be ruled out. A wallet
    can also be lost after a hardware failure or natural disaster. The wallet or private
    keys can be stored in any number of copies, as long as you manage to keep them
    secure. If all wallet copies are lost, all bitcoins associated with it will forever
    remain immovable in the blockchain, since the private key is the only guarantor

    transfer of information messages with different content in other types of blockchains.
    Each transaction is a financial message composed according to the established
    rules and signed with the sender’s cryptographic key. The transaction contains
    the amount of coins (tokens) to be transferred, the sender’s signature, and the
    recipient’s address based on his public key. To use the coins transmitted in a
    transaction, a private key must be paired with the public key specified in the
    transaction. Once transmitted to the network, the transaction must be validated,
    written into a blockchain block, and distributed to all nodes in the bitcoin peer-to-peer
    network. The block contains a header for transmitting technical information and
    a list of transactions in which user data – payment or any other transaction –
    is transmitted. A blockchain consists of blocks connected in series. The previous
    block’s hash is supplied in each new block’s header. In this way, an unbreakable
    chain is formed. It can only be broken or changed by recalculating all block headers
    and reassembling the chain from the break point. This requires using computational
    resources equivalent to or greater than those expended in assembling the original
    chain. This means that the long-term security of a classic blockchain depends
    on total computational power. The most trusted blockchains are those that require
    a resource expenditure that is incomparable to the benefit gained.

    technology that allowed the seller to transfer the money. How does it work? Every
    transaction on the blockchain network, such as a transfer of funds from one person
    to another, is translated as a block and added to the chain of other blocks in
    the chain. Such transfers are secure because they are effectively an encrypted
    message that only the recipient can open and use the contents. All transactions
    are undisputed and recorded in a blockchain that resembles a large ledger. With
    a blockchain, participants in a process store information about transactions and
    transactions between them. This data is visible to all of them and cannot be deleted
    or changed retroactively. This technology property opens up great opportunities
    for businesses and consumers: many processes can be simplified, paperwork and
    intermediaries can be eliminated, and all transactions can be controlled in real-time.
    Companies can significantly reduce business costs, and their customers can get
    the final product at a lower price. Perhaps the only drawback of the technology
    to date is the small number of parties connected to it. In a blockchain network,
    all parties, including the manufacturer and often even the customs authorities,

    decentralization, and cost efficiency make an excellent record-keeping system.
    Their comparison of the system to the traditional centralized system highlights
    the tremendous revolution blockchain has brought to the record-keeping industry.
    One of the blockchain’s essential features is the algorithms that permit record-keepers
    to rewind and undo false reports in the ledger’s historical records. Besides the

    by the people and are made to transact and manage their assets by themselves to
    avoid risk and make money. Blockchain is a platform that helps to create a central
    resource that will automatically act as a ledger where these resources and the
    records could be verified to validate the information.

    for traceability to be achieved. Using tracking information, I am able to keep
    track of where my product is at all times. The history of all the steps my thing
    has taken is referred to as tracking data. According to Wattanakul et al. [[14](#CR14)],
    monitoring data comes in three forms: setting data, transport-related conditions,
    and business-related transactions. A frequency (real-time, event-driven, batch,
    or offline) and a collection method are often specified for each of these kinds
    of data. Wattanakul et al. [[14](#CR14)] state that this traceability data may
    be divided into three categories based on their characteristics: (1) master (for
    non-changing data, such as IDs); (2) transactional (e.g., departure and arrival
    times); (3) status conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity). This data may also
    be utilized to make tactical and strategic choices after being collected, cleansed,
    aggregated, and archived. When it comes to supply chain traceability, the traditional
    design relies on information gathering mostly through EDI exchanges, with some
    calls to web services thrown in. In some instances, the carriers’ information
    systems are the only source of all traceability information. Therefore, these

    informed in the case of an accident, sensor fusion synchronizes input from several
    sensors with real-time data from the road. It is because of this that driver assistance
    technologies like lane departure warnings and accident prevention techniques are
    becoming more commonplace. All of these aspects have resulted in modern automobiles
    being equipped with a wide range of communication devices and protocols that make

    It rewards effective communication by exchanging trust bits. These trust bits
    were traded in the vehicle cloud using blockchain technology, which recorded and
    preserved historical documentation of those transactions. This makes it possible

  zh: 区块链技术在许多健康和医疗领域都有巨大的潜力。生物识别技术、区块链和电子健康记录（EHR）自上世纪以来，医生、医院和医疗设备一直在推动医疗记录的数字化，因为数字化这些数据使其更易于访问和共享，并为更好和更快的决策提供了基础。区块链技术在医疗保健中最常见的应用之一是电子医疗记录。
- en: Patients who later split from the data of a healthcare provider may easily lose
    access to past data if they use electronic health records (EHRs), which are not
    intended to keep track of the records of several medical facilities and patients.
    Many academics have considered the use of blockchain technology for EHR maintenance
    since it is vital to discover an innovative approach to administer EHRs in order
    to encourage patients to access their current and historical health data. A “MedRec”
    prototype utilizes specific benefits for handling authentication, secrecy, integrity,
    and easy data exchange, all in one package. They offer patients an immutable,
    entire history and simple access to their healthcare information from different
    physicians or treatment facilities through a decentralized record management system
    [[37](#CR37)]. “MedRec” does not keep any records of your medical care and does
    not need to be adjusted. It alerts the patient, who is in charge of the record’s
    location, and records a mark on a blockchain. The mark serves as a guarantee that
    you have purchased a replica of the document. Similarly, it gives patients more
    control over their health by shifting the organization’s burden of care to them.
    Administrator associations perform the function of patient agent for patients
    who do not want their information processed. Today, users’ patient entries are
    complex in design, require more labor, and have different user interfaces depending
    on the foundation. An interface is included in the MedRec architecture to help
    maintain connections with healthcare records when they travel between organizations
    ([https://​medrec.​media.​mit.​edu/​](https://medrec.media.mit.edu/)). With EHR
    implementation, medical data sharing typically confronts significant restrictions
    such as loss of controlled data and dependability and verification and safe backup
    of medical information. Medical Data Sharing MeDShare, developed by Xia et al.
    [[38](#CR38)], is a safe system that ensures the transmission of medical data
    between parties who are not trusted. MeDShare may be used by cloud service providers,
    hospitals, and health research to share medical data and manage electronic health
    records. More substantial data sources, personalized audit control, and minimum
    dangers to privacy and safety are all characteristics of good governance organizations

- en: Typically, electronic health records (EHRs) include highly confidential patient
    data that must be shared among physicians, radiologists, nurses, pharmacists,
    researchers, and others in the healthcare industry to provide accurate diagnosis
    and treatment. As long as this extremely sensitive patient information is stored,
    transmitted, and disseminated among many organizations, it poses a significant
    danger to patients’ health and the preservation of patients’ medical records.
    The incidence of these hazards can become bigger than the history of previous
    and subsequent treatment, follow-up, and rehabilitation procedures in patients
    with chronic illnesses (such as cancer or HIV). In order to provide successful

    Key Signature Infrastructure (KSI). Each node in the blockchain stores the state
    of the data, network, and hash. KSI will constantly monitor the hash value with

    making it better suited to our current context, which includes networked object
    data and services [[103](#CR103)]. Second, not everyone should have access to
    blockchain data. This challenge may be solved by utilizing private blockchains,
    which can govern blockchain access privileges and transaction execution rights.
