- en: The concept of “blockchain” became widely known in 2009 with the emergence of
    the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and relatively recently, the prospects of blockchain
    application in other areas began to be discussed. Blockchain is a technology of
    storing and processing data in a chain of blocks in computer networks, which does
    not refer to any particular domain [[1](#CR1)]. Each block in the chain can contain
    arbitrary data, including production processes, which allows describing the possibilities
    of using this technology in production systems [[2](#CR2)].

    necessitate the resolution of several data interchange and processing issues,
    including storage, access, security, and so on. Furthermore, there is a contemporary
    trend toward developing distributed systems rather than centralized ones. One
    of the most essential characteristics of the Internet of Things is its nodes’
    autonomy and capacity to interact with one another [[3](#CR3)]. This is a service-based
    interaction in which specialized nodes deliver services to other nodes in the
    network. Some blockchain implementations use a smart contract mechanism to enable
    such interaction.

- en: A smart contract is a self-executing script that is stored with other data in
    the blockchain. Each smart contract has its algorithm written in a specific programming
    language and automatically conducts any activities without the involvement of
    other parties. A smart contract monitors the fulfillment of specified circumstances
    and, using the given algorithm, takes choices based on them. Because every network
    member may sign a contract, this mode of engagement extends to Internet of Things
    nodes. This technique creates a dependable environment for transferring network
    nodes and makes services visible and uniform. Furthermore, because all contracts
    are already maintained in blockchain, there is no need to construct a separate
    service registry [[4](#CR4)].

    benefits of blockchain technology for developing CPS and the Industrial Internet
    of Things, it is required to design the ideal blockchain network topology based
    on the tasks to be done and select the most relevant tools (software and hardware).

    physical processes. On the other hand, some argue that it is a system that combines
    environmental elements with the computational part. Data acquired from the environment
    and actions in the environment correspond to the environmental elements. From
    the moment there is a translation of data from the environment into the digital
    world, it is the responsibility of computing to handle this data. CPSs monitor
    and control the physical world, with the possibility of having sensor networks,
    as well as associated actuators [[6](#CR6)]. Thus, this type of systems depends
    on the synergy between physical and computational components. On the other hand,
    and unlike traditional embedded systems, the CPSs emphasize a holistic view of
    the system, that is, it is seen as a whole, and not only as several isolated modules.

    A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” signed by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto,
    was published. It described the theoretical foundations for creating a new generation
    of electronic currency: decentralized, transparent, and independent of central
    banks and regulators [[8](#CR8)]. However, it was not widespread and in the first
    months it was discussed in academic circles – among cryptographers, mathematicians,
    and programmers. Bitcoin, the world’s first blockchain, which is the embodiment
    of the concept of this article, was launched on January 3, 2009, and has been
    successfully functioning for almost 10 years. Several thousand blockchains have
    emerged during this time, replicating bitcoin with minor variations and bearing
    little resemblance to its progenitor. Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity is still unknown,
    as he stepped away from bitcoin development in 2010 and has never revealed his
    name or even the country where he lives. Researchers and journalists have put
    forward many theories about Satoshi, but none have been confirmed. There have
    also been many imposters who have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, but not one
    of them has been able to provide sufficient evidence to back up their claims.
    To date, the public is likely to accept only one way to confirm Satoshi’s identity:
    ownership of bitcoins he mined in 2009–2010\. Satoshi is credited with more than
    a million bitcoins, which have never come to fruition except for a few test transactions
    sent to prove the blockchain is working. In particular, Satoshi sent the first-ever
    10 BTC blockchain transaction to the famous cryptographer Harold (Hal) Finney,
    who was actively involved in the discussion of the theoretical foundations of
    bitcoin. However, while all the glory of creating bitcoin as the world’s first
    workable blockchain undoubtedly belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, the blockchain did
    not emerge as an isolated discovery that appeared out of nowhere, from nowhere.
    In fact, blockchain is the result of the synthesis of several trends in information
    and financial technology, united by the insights of Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever
    he may be. Among the technologies and solutions from which bitcoin and blockchain
    emerged are commonly cited:'

    back in 1998, more than 10 years before bitcoin appeared. BitGold was never put
    into practice, but its concept is almost identical to bitcoin in some aspects
    of a decentralized payment network. Nick Szabo has been repeatedly “put on a pedestal”
    by declaring that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, but Szabo himself denies it. He is also
    the author of the term “smart contract.” The smart contract was realized with
    cryptocurrencies and will be met many times in this book.

    curve cryptography (ECDSA), sends transactions, and creates addresses using a
    classical pair of private and public keys. Like any other blockchain token, owning
    bitcoins is analogous to owning the private key needed to send it to another network

    hashing standard SHA2-256, while other blockchains often use other hashing algorithms.
    The hash tree is used to form a block header, and calculating a hash of the required
    complexity is a computational task that must be performed to create a new block

    ledger” is also often used. There is some conceptual difference between the two,
    because a distributed ledger is a broader concept. We can even say that blockchain
    is a particular case of a distributed ledger. Government and corporate projects
    often create distributed registries with a hierarchical rather than peer-to-peer
    structure, where some nodes have a higher level of authority and can influence
    the entire network and make decisions without the support of the majority.

    electronic currency system, which is peer-to-peer or decentralized. There will
    be no need for a trusted third party using the protocol’s decentralized fiduciary
    mechanism. Decentralization dictates that anybody can contribute to the code’s
    development (although an entry fee must be obtained). If a transaction has been
    approved, it is added to the bitcoin blockchain; otherwise, it is removed. To
    maintain transaction security and integrity, a variety of cryptographic techniques
    are employed. At the moment, bitcoin is the most popular public blockchain system
    on the Internet. Bitcoins are created in exchange for the processing of each transaction,
    according to the software source code. Users (miners) use their computing power
    to verify, save, and guarantee transactions and burn them into the blockchain.
    This work done by miners is called Proof of Work (PoW) and consists of solving
    algorithmic problems that are part of the bitcoin protocol. Once the transaction
    is validated, it is time-stamped, added to the blockchain, and is then visible
    to the recipient and all members of the network. The blockchain described above
    and used to generate bitcoins is a public blockchain.

    a small and specified number of participants instead of a public blockchain. The
    ability to participate in transactions and the verification tasks are both determined
    by an organization. There is a private network with a predetermined number of
    nodes, such as a blockchain of location, described in the literature. A cryptography-based
    technique is not required in a private blockchain. There are no miners, no Proof
    of Work, and no monetary reward on a private blockchain. These are the primary
    differences between public and private data storage and transmission systems (public
    key infrastructure). Thus, a blockchain of any sort is a low-cost, decentralized,
    and fully secure storage and data transmission mechanism.

    interbank financial messaging networks (such as SWIFT), but has a number of differences
    in how it is communicated and managed. Blockchain nodes, called wallets, are analogous
    to bank accounts, just as a bitcoin address is analogous to a customer’s bank
    account number or SWIFT bank identifier [[10](#CR10)]. A blockchain wallet is
    an instance of blockchain access and transaction software. The wallet can run
    on almost any electronic device with an operating system, including a server,
    PC, laptop, or smartphone. A blockchain wallet has similarities to online banking,
    which provides access to money in a bank account. Still, the blockchain user has
    sole and complete control over their money and can independently start any number
    of wallets without providing personal information or documents to any organization.
    At the same time, the user is solely responsible for all actions with the wallet,
    and all technical and legal problems he will have to solve. The blockchain circulates
    virtual units of account, which can be used as money or perform certain technical
    functions. These units have the same name: bitcoin (bitcoin, BTC, from “bit,”
    a minimal unit of information, and coin, a coin) in the bitcoin system. Because
    bitcoin was conceived as the electronic equivalent of gold, cryptocurrency monetary
    units are commonly referred to as coins. At the same time, the broader term “token,”
    long used in IT systems and games, is now used for nonfinancial blockchains. As

    Each address is unique and the probability of creating two identical addresses
    in different wallets is almost zero. The movement of coins (tokens) between wallets
    in a blockchain is certified by a user’s unique private key, which he uses to
    make a cryptographic signature of the transaction, thus certifying his authority
    as a wallet owner. A wallet’s private key is the only proof of token ownership,
    and anyone who receives a copy of that key will have the same power in the blockchain
    as the owner of the original wallet. Therefore, the security of private keys requires
    the highest level of security possible. Hacking into the bitcoin network from
    the outside is now virtually out of the question, as its reliability has been
    confirmed by many years of operation. However, individual hacking wallets or centralized
    services that handle cryptocurrencies and tokens cannot be ruled out. A wallet
    can also be lost after a hardware failure or natural disaster. The wallet or private
    keys can be stored in any number of copies, as long as you manage to keep them
    secure. If all wallet copies are lost, all bitcoins associated with it will forever
    remain immovable in the blockchain, since the private key is the only guarantor
    of their transferability. Therefore, the node owner (wallet) must be fully responsible
    for the safety of its assets.

    – debits from one address and credits to another in financial blockchains or the
    transfer of information messages with different content in other types of blockchains.
    Each transaction is a financial message composed according to the established
    rules and signed with the sender’s cryptographic key. The transaction contains
    the amount of coins (tokens) to be transferred, the sender’s signature, and the
    recipient’s address based on his public key. To use the coins transmitted in a
    transaction, a private key must be paired with the public key specified in the
    transaction. Once transmitted to the network, the transaction must be validated,
    written into a blockchain block, and distributed to all nodes in the bitcoin peer-to-peer
    network. The block contains a header for transmitting technical information and
    a list of transactions in which user data – payment or any other transaction –
    is transmitted. A blockchain consists of blocks connected in series. The previous
    block’s hash is supplied in each new block’s header. In this way, an unbreakable
    chain is formed. It can only be broken or changed by recalculating all block headers
    and reassembling the chain from the break point. This requires using computational
    resources equivalent to or greater than those expended in assembling the original
    chain. This means that the long-term security of a classic blockchain depends
    on total computational power. The most trusted blockchains are those that require
    a resource expenditure that is incomparable to the benefit gained.

    technology that allowed the seller to transfer the money. How does it work? Every
    transaction on the blockchain network, such as a transfer of funds from one person
    to another, is translated as a block and added to the chain of other blocks in
    the chain. Such transfers are secure because they are effectively an encrypted
    message that only the recipient can open and use the contents. All transactions

    According to Gupta [[11](#CR11)], the blockchain is an information recording system
    customized with security features that make it impossible to hack attacks or cheat
    in the system. Abadi and Brunnermeier [[12](#CR12)] indicate a ledger system that
    decentralizes the records by distributing them across all the blockchain networks.
    Transactions in the blockchain system are distributed to all the system participants,
    making it hard to cheat or steal. They further indicate that technology’s correctness,
    decentralization, and cost efficiency make an excellent record-keeping system.
    Their comparison of the system to the traditional centralized system highlights
    the tremendous revolution blockchain has brought to the record-keeping industry.
    One of the blockchain’s essential features is the algorithms that permit record-keepers
    to rewind and undo false reports in the ledger’s historical records. Besides the
    finance industry, the system is quite useful in procurement, Internet apps, among
    other industries where transparency is highly required.

    on a global scale to be more agile, efficient, and efficient while providing an
    attractive price, security, and security model. Blockchain is a technology enabling
    digital transactions between a human or an entity and an outside entity. The blockchain
    is a distributed database that stores information about everything. It is used
    to store a wealth of information about users, the networks that connect them,
    and any other connected devices. Each blockchain is called a “wallet” or “blockchain”
    because of the blockchain’s blockchain. These wallets store information recorded
    by the network. This information is known as the “transaction.” Blockchain provides
    a framework for decentralized application developers, allowing users to communicate
    directly and secure their assets using cryptography. It will enable users to store
    digital signatures for goods and services securely. They can also send messages
    to each other. Some of these messages can be used to make payments, but this is
    still more than an intermediary service. It is the application-level layer where
    the application can perform operations. The application can be any operating system
    or application program with a blockchain backend [[13](#CR13)].

    works. The concept of blockchain differs from traditional banks as they are created
    by the people and are made to transact and manage their assets by themselves to
    avoid risk and make money. Blockchain is a platform that helps to create a central
    resource that will automatically act as a ledger where these resources and the

    informed in the case of an accident, sensor fusion synchronizes input from several
    sensors with real-time data from the road. It is because of this that driver assistance
    technologies like lane departure warnings and accident prevention techniques are
    becoming more commonplace. All of these aspects have resulted in modern automobiles
    being equipped with a wide range of communication devices and protocols that make

    physicians or treatment facilities through a decentralized record management system
    [[37](#CR37)]. “MedRec” does not keep any records of your medical care and does
    not need to be adjusted. It alerts the patient, who is in charge of the record’s
    location, and records a mark on a blockchain. The mark serves as a guarantee that
    you have purchased a replica of the document. Similarly, it gives patients more
    control over their health by shifting the organization’s burden of care to them.
    Administrator associations perform the function of patient agent for patients
    who do not want their information processed. Today, users’ patient entries are
    complex in design, require more labor, and have different user interfaces depending
    on the foundation. An interface is included in the MedRec architecture to help
    maintain connections with healthcare records when they travel between organizations
    ([https://​medrec.​media.​mit.​edu/​](https://medrec.media.mit.edu/)). With EHR
    implementation, medical data sharing typically confronts significant restrictions
    such as loss of controlled data and dependability and verification and safe backup
    of medical information. Medical Data Sharing MeDShare, developed by Xia et al.
    [[38](#CR38)], is a safe system that ensures the transmission of medical data
    between parties who are not trusted. MeDShare may be used by cloud service providers,
    hospitals, and health research to share medical data and manage electronic health
    records. More substantial data sources, personalized audit control, and minimum
    dangers to privacy and safety are all characteristics of good governance organizations
    (GROs).

    data that must be shared among physicians, radiologists, nurses, pharmacists,
    researchers, and others in the healthcare industry to provide accurate diagnosis
    and treatment. As long as this extremely sensitive patient information is stored,
    transmitted, and disseminated among many organizations, it poses a significant
    danger to patients’ health and the preservation of patients’ medical records.
    The incidence of these hazards can become bigger than the history of previous
    and subsequent treatment, follow-up, and rehabilitation procedures in patients
    with chronic illnesses (such as cancer or HIV). In order to provide successful
    therapy, it is critical to maintain the patient’s current medical history. Blockchain-based
    architecture for organizing, storing, and sharing cancer patients’ electro-medical
    information has been developed by Dubovitskaya et al. [[39](#CR39)] to get around
    these restrictions. To access, manage, and store encrypted patient data, they

    the increasing usage of blockchain technology in medicine throughout the world
    is a good sign for patients who want their medical information to be as accurate
    and unaltered as possible. Any effort to gain access or make adjustments is easily
    identified and tracked over the blockchain. Not only does this assist in maintaining
    the integrity of the patient data, but it also identifies any illegal activity
    such as blockchain fraud or record fabrication. It will be much easier to share
    and evaluate approved medical care records now that they have been standardized.
    Most of the patient’s providers had already seen it by the time of the appointment.
    Patient management algorithms that take into account prescription interactions,
    hypersensitivities, and pharmacological solutions make it possible to process
    all of these things across all blockchain records quickly. Consequently, blockchain
    innovation will benefit from medical record management [[41](#CR41)], faster validation

    enrolment. Blockchain, the Internet’s next-generation, has the potential to solve
    these issues. Healthcare experts are using blockchain technology to try to find
    solutions to these issues. Blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine
    learning will soon be taking over the healthcare industry. The Ethereum-permissioned
    protocol described by Nugent et al. [[42](#CR42)] provides smart contract capabilities
    on the blockchain, which is employed in clinics together with data administration
    systems. The study’s primary goal was to find a solution to the challenging challenge
    of patient recruitment. As a result of the study’s findings, it was recommended
    that Ethereum smart contracts be used in clinical trials for data management system
    transparency in order to make transactions more efficient. As a result, one of
    the current uses of blockchain technology in clinical research is patient enrollment.
    Benchoufi et al. [[43](#CR43)] devised a procedure that allows for the collecting
    of patients' informed consent, which is bound to protocol changes, the storage
    and tracking of the consent in a secure, unfalsifiable, and publically verifiable
    manner, and the real-time exchange of this information. The management of the
    medication supply chain is a major use of blockchain in the medical business.
    In many sectors, supply management is vital, but it is even more so in healthcare
    due to the industry’s rising complexity. Any lapse in the healthcare supply chain
    directly impacts the health of the patients [[44](#CR44)]. Because of the numerous
    moving elements and individuals involved, blockchains are extremely insecure and
    include several security gaps that hackers may exploit. Due to greater data openness
    and improved product traceability, blockchains offer a secure platform for eliminating
    this problem and preventing fraud in some circumstances. Manipulating the blockchain
    is difficult since the string in the blockchain cannot be confirmed or modified

    According to [[11](#CR11)], the blockchain is an information recording system
    customized with security features that make it impossible to hack attacks or cheat
    in the system. Abadi et al. [[12](#CR12)] indicate a ledger system that decentralizes
    the records by distributing them across all the blockchain networks. Transactions
    in the blockchain system are distributed to all the system participants, making
    it hard to cheat or steal. They further indicate that technology’s correctness,
    decentralization, and cost efficiency make an excellent record-keeping system.
    Their comparison of the system to the traditional centralized system highlights
    the tremendous revolution blockchain has brought to the record-keeping industry.
    One of the blockchain’s essential features is the algorithms that permit record-keepers
    to rewind and undo false reports in the ledger’s historical records. Besides the
    finance industry, the system is quite useful in procurement, Internet apps, among
    other industries where transparency is highly required. My focus will be on the

    tremendously. The financial organizations dealing with money and assets transactions
    are highly exposed and susceptible to experiencing losses brought about by fraud
    or crime. The financial sector has previously depended on a centralized system
    for record-keeping. Hackers and crime agents are well versed with this kind of
    design, and it is effortless for them to manipulate it as one access to such a
    system would give them the ultimate power to do as they please. Blockchain is
    a secure, non-corruptible technology that depends on a hard decentralized network
    for attackers to manipulate or penetrate. Each transaction is recorded and stored
    in the form of a cryptographic mechanism. The mechanism has an almost impossible
    way of being corrupted, and if corrupted, there are easy ways of tracing the attackers.
    The difficulty is linking all blocks so that if one breach is detected, they all
    detect and show the change. The linked blocks also reduce the time of tracing
    the breach, reducing the time for the attackers to conduct any illegal business
    in the system.

    of this review’s papers [[80](#CR80)]. The ability to alter the degree of distortion

    network data to protect against clone sensor nodes attacks. The embedding is based

    consistently and independently since they are not dependent on the values of these
    sensory data or some of their features. While traditional digital watermarking
    methods and algorithms and the problem of wireless sensor networks and the Internet
    of Things can create a digital watermark based on protected data, the notion is
    exceedingly wide.

    on the sensor data elements’ values. The embedding approach provided in [[86](#CR86)]
    is one example. This approach generates the digital watermark bit inserted in

    nonetheless, this technique poses a challenge with timing. Think about what may
    happen if a message arrives with the data out of order. The digital watermark
    extraction will be hampered even if there is not an active intruder on the communication
    channel. Wang et al. [[87](#CR87)] offer an answer to this dilemma. Sensor data
    is divided depending on the key into variable-length groups, as proposed by the
    authors in their paper. Digital watermark chains are produced and implanted for
    pairs of adjacent groupings. A series of digital watermarks are used to verify
    the sensor data. Separators and data synchronization are provided by the second
    digital watermark chain, which encodes group separators.

    of their characteristics is possible in a more complex scenario. Ferdowsi et al.
    [[88](#CR88)] proposed a watermarking algorithm for dynamic authentication of
    IoT signals to detect cyber-attacks. It is possible for IoT devices (IoTDs) to
    extract a collection of stochastic characteristics from their produced signal
    and dynamically watermark these features into the signal using the suggested watermarking
    technique. In order to authenticate the signals collected by the IoT gateway,
    this approach allows the IoTDs to be authenticated. Hameed et al. [[89](#CR89)]
    also addressed how to create a digital watermark using several aspects of the
    acquired data, such as data length, frequency of occurrence, and time of capture.
    Nguyen et al. [[90](#CR90)] create a digital watermark based on CSMA/CA protocol
    collisions to deter sensor node clone attacks. Furthermore, the way the sensor
    data is portrayed is a distinguishing characteristic of the study. They are combined
    to make a matrix resembling a digital image. In general, such a system enables
    the adoption of methodologies that have proven successful when dealing with digital
    pictures with sensory data.

    in the mentioned study work. Watermarking analog transmissions (particularly modulated
    signals) to solve signal source authentication is also a field of study. The answers
    discovered in those works are ideally comparable to those found in digital watermarking.
    The distinction is solely in the manner in which the signal is represented and,
    as a result, in the manner in which it is processed.

    of Things) standard focuses on research [[91](#CR91)]. The notion of a radio-frequency
    watermark is used in the investigation. Rather than using binary sequences for
    future embedding, the watermark is first created as a digital one and then converted
    to modulated signals. The main benefit of the suggested technique is that it is
    more reliable since the useable signal and the watermark signal do not conflict
    with one another.

    Rubio-Hernan et al. [[92](#CR92)] suggested an adaptive control-theoretic technique
    for detecting cyber replication attempts on networked control industrial systems.
    This refers to an intruder’s effort to tamper with system control by replicating
    previously intercepted data sequences. The fundamental contribution of this work
    is not the embedding technique, which is borrowed from prior publications, but
    rather the approach for employing this algorithm to guard against an intruder.

    in signals conveyed in “hard” real-time industrial control systems. The authors
    choose ship control systems as the most important field of application. A secret
    key must be delivered in advance through a secure communication channel before
    embedding can begin. The approach described here can detect attacks that aim to
    cause signal delay and distortion.

    have begun to emerge as outlined in the preceding section. Different security
    concerns in cyber-physical systems are addressed by blockchain and digital watermarks.
    Their combined use may produce a better level of security than each of these methods
    alone. This concept has previously been explored in prior works, but mostly in
    one aspect, namely, the issue of digital rights management [[79](#CR79), [91](#CR91)].
    The collaborative implementation of these technologies in other areas [[7](#CR7),

    as seen by the numerous breaches and frauds that have been reported. This is a
    paradoxical snare to fall into for a system whose key touted attributes are dependability
    and inviolability. Computer assaults, on the other hand, are carried over to all
    types of interactions with other systems – primarily markets, which are vulnerable
    to the classic flaws of centralized systems, like banks [[102](#CR102)].

    issues with blockchains have been shown and well documented. Mining issues, which
    are at the heart of the Proof of Work on which the bitcoin consensus is based,
    are also the subject of much debate. On the theoretical level, it is a matter
    of rigorously defining the conditions that will protect against malicious validation
    nodes. The level of 51% of the computing power held by a malicious entity is certainly
    considered the reference level. However, this value is the subject of controversy
    in the research community. The number and distribution of nodes is also a sensitive
    issue. Economic issues are also beginning to mobilize researchers [[10](#CR10)].
    In addition to the monetary and financial aspects (competition between currencies,
    monetary systems), the themes concern the economics of mining, with the question
    of cooperative incentives for miners or the evolution of mining capacity. And
    the debates do not stop at bitcoin, since many depend on the consensus model chosen
    to replace the centralized decision-making system. Whatever the case may be, the
    technological environment for distributed registries will continue to evolve significantly.

    Due to the vastness of the bitcoin network, this process might take many hours
    to complete. Using a blockchain like Hyperledger Sawtooth helps reduce this latency
    since it allows the PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time) consensus process to be used,
    which is among the fastest and least resource-hungry in terms of reaction time,
    making it better suited to our current context, which includes networked object
    data and services [[103](#CR103)]. Second, not everyone should have access to
    blockchain data. This challenge may be solved by utilizing private blockchains,
    which can govern blockchain access privileges and transaction execution rights.
    Second, the blockchain’s consensus algorithms, notably the PoW (Proof of Work),
    are extremely energy-hungry in terms of calculations.

    whether or not a new block may be added to the blockchain are energy-hungry. The
    blockchain, in the end, represents a sea change in thinking. In other words, the
    network is becoming decentralized instead of centrally controlled. Customers may
    have difficulty adopting and integrating this technology into their existing ecosystems
    as a result of this.

    between transparency and confidentiality, between anonymity and identification
    of stakeholders. Because the register is widely disseminated, stakeholders may
    easily access the plain language information it includes. When it comes to tracing
    transactions, this is a benefit, but when it comes to corporate confidentiality,
    such as in banking or healthcare, it is a redhibitory problem. The market looks
    for ways to reliably disguise information while engaging in activities that require
    the disclosure of some and the protection of others [[58](#CR58)].

    a lot of power-hungry verification, validation, and cryptography procedures. If
    this technique is widely used, it might have significant negative environmental
    externalities.

    registries are not a panacea. Blockchain is not yet suitable for the fast processing
    of large amounts of data, especially video and audio, and use in a fast-changing
    environment for use in fast-changing environments. Blockchain is ideal for the
    long term and most as reliably as possible for storing information that changes
    infrequently. Therefore, the technology is promising for capturing customer data
    from banks, medical institutions, and insurance and logistics companies [[104](#CR104)].
    A distributed transaction registry will benefit patent offices and cadastral offices.
    Technology is suitable for law enforcement and tax authorities to record personal
    data. Brokerage and investment firms will benefit from blockchain as a registry
    of transactions. The technology’s current capabilities are just an in-between.
    The continuous improvement of blockchain opens up prospects for its application
    in new industries. In its evolution, any technology must overcome resistance to
    change. Blockchain has already passed that stage, and, therefore, it will continue
    to evolve.
