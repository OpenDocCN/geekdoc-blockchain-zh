- en: The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and digital assets has grown in
    recent years at an exponential rate. There are a wide variety of reasons for this.
    Firstly, both retail and institutional investors are seemingly continually hungry
    for new types of non-traditional, also called alternative investments. Historically,
    these alternative investments have included vehicles such as hedge funds and private
    equity funds. Today these types of so-called alternatives are now well-established
    and well-funded. While hedge funds and private equity still continue to grow,
    the continued strong performance of large cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum has reignited investor interest in the space.

    investible opportunity set in the crypto and digital space. Outside of simply
    well-established cryptocurrencies, there are a variety of emerging crypto-related
    investment options such as yield farming and newer digital investments such as
    stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFT), security tokens and DeFi tokens. As institutional
    and retail capital continue to invest in the crypto and digital space, the worldwide
    adoption and continued regulation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is inevitable.

    In the early days of the space, there were a number of technical complexities
    making the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies complex. Today, retail investors
    can easily create accounts with a variety of well-established multi-billion dollar
    crypto exchanges and make purchases in a user-friendly way. Similarly, catering
    to the institutional investor space traditional asset managers are increasingly
    launching multi-million dollar, and in some cases multi-billion dollar, investment
    vehicles to invest in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, a whole host of industries
    and related service providers have developed to support these new capital flows
    into the space.

    and compliance aspects related to cryptocurrency investing. While this book does
    provide an introductory background to allow the reader to gain a basic understanding
    of the technical aspects of how cryptocurrencies work, the focus is not on technology.
    A key reason for this is that there are a myriad of technologies and computer
    languages supporting cryptocurrencies that are constantly evolving. Examples of
    these are blockchain, distributed ledger technology, Ethereum virtual machine
    (EVM) platform technology for smart contracts and Dapps. The specifics of these
    different technologies continue to be researched and refined as new applications
    for them are developed. New cryptocurrencies are being developed and rolled out
    on a regular basis and these evolving technologies are utilized to support them.
    Topic-specific books on these crypto-related technologies can be referenced to
    learn about each specific technology.

    general idea of what the term cryptocurrency, often simply abbreviated as ***crypto***,
    means but you might not be able to clearly come up with a universal definition
    of what crypto is specifically. A key reason for the difficulty in defining what
    crypto is relates to the fact that the space continues to rapidly evolve. These
    evolutions in the crypto space have across a number of fronts. From a technology
    perspective, there have been continued technological advances in the underlying
    capabilities of cryptocurrencies, the ways crypto is stored and traded as well
    as the technical applications of their use. From a capital markets perspective,
    the amount of money that has been invested in crypto has continued to increase
    exponentially in recent years and this has fueled a number of new advances with
    regard to the ways in which cryptocurrencies can be profited off of including
    increased platforms for the profitable lending of cryptocurrencies.

    think of Bitcoin. This is understandable as Bitcoin has received not only the
    bulk of media attention related to the cryptocurrency markets, but also the bulk
    of capital in the space. Recent estimates mark Bitcoin as having a market capitalization
    of approximately $650 billion which makes up approximately 68% of the total cryptocurrency
    market.[¹](#FPar1) While Bitcoin’s percentage of the overall crypto markets has
    not always been so large, with this type of current market dominance it is no
    wonder, that Bitcoin has been at the forefront of investor’s initial interest
    in the cryptocurrency space.

    growing constellation of cryptocurrencies. But what exactly is a cryptocurrency?
    Merriam-Webster defines a cryptocurrency as, “*any form of currency that only
    exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority
    but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the
    issuance of new units, and that relies on* *cryptography* *to prevent counterfeiting
    and fraudulent transactions*.”[²](#FPar1)

    Let us unpack it to understand some key areas it addresses. First of all, the
    definition states that a cryptocurrency only exists digitally. While this is true,
    a cryptocurrency is only one type of a broader category of digital assets. We
    will address the larger concept of digital assets as compared to cryptocurrencies
    throughout this book, but for now let us acknowledge that a cryptocurrency is
    not something we can physically hold or touch in the real world, but instead cryptocurrencies
    only exist digitally. In contrast, an example of a non-digital asset would be
    actual paper money or physical coins.

- en: Historically there were two broad categories of non-crypto ***money***. The
    first is known as ***representative money***. This type of money is a certificate
    or a token that can be exchanged for an actual physical underlying commodity.
    An example of this would be paper money or coins that could be exchanged for gold.
    In this way, the money or coins was a representative placeholder for holding gold.
    The United States adhered to a gold standard for much of its history up until
    June 1933 when spurred in large part by gold hoarding caused by the Great Depression,
    the decision was made to transition away from the gold standard.[³](#FPar1) This
    transition process ultimately ended in August 1971 when the US would no longer
    convert US currency to gold.

    category of money known as ***fiat money***. Fiat money derives its value from
    simply being declared so-called, “legal tender” by the government of a country
    that issues it.[⁴](#FPar1) From a legal perspective in the United States the Article
    IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, also known as the ***Full Faith and Credit
    Clause***, outlines in part that the government agrees to repay any debt it owes
    such as those incurred by issuing money. Despite the fact that there is no physical
    commodity behind the paper bills and coins, as is the case with representative
    money, it is this full faith and credit promise by the government that gives people
    confidence in fiat money. For reference, fiat money is also sometimes called ***fiat
    currency***, or simply ***fiat***.

    of metal coins and paper fiat, there were intermediary means of exchange utilized
    such as commodities as salt, cattle, the exchanging of ceremonial objects such
    as the Kula system of the Trobriand Islands and cowrie shells.[⁶](#FPar1) As societies
    transitioned from barter and commodity type exchange systems to fiat money there
    was a shift in the perception of the way the concept of wealth or value can be
    stored and transacted in. Today as cryptocurrencies become increasingly popular
    and attract more investments from both retail and institutional investors, there
    has once again been a shift in the perception of what constitutes a currency and
    how value can be stored and transacted in.

    such as Bitcoin are not truly fungible because of this lack of uniform synchronicity
    of prices. As a counter to this argument, as the cryptocurrency markets have continued

- en: Returning to our definition of cryptocurrency, a key element of the definition
    was that cryptocurrencies exist only digitally, and not physically. It is important
    to highlight this point, that cryptocurrencies are only in digital form because
    this is in contrast to fiat money which can exist both in digital and in physical
    form. Based on our discussion of fiat money above, this statement might cause
    you to pause. We previously only discussed the physical aspects of fiat money,
    such as paper notes or coins. Fiat can exist digitally as well. As the economic
    and financial systems of the world have increasingly become digitized through
    technology this has resulted in the expansion of people not only utilizing physical
    fiat money (i.e., bills and coins) to pay for goods and services to other methods,
    but other fiat-based methods as well that do not directly involve the actual holding
    of fiat currency.

    a debit card to pay for something such as a good, fiat money from their bank account
    is transferred to the bank account of the merchant. The debit card itself is not
    fiat, but its use causes the real-world transfer of fiat. In practice, this transfer
    does not involve banks physically moving currency among account but rather transferring
    the money electronically and recording the transactions in digital ledgers accordingly.
    A similar process digital process is employed for electronic wire transfers of
    funds. In this way, the use of fiat currency has both real-world and digital applications.

    the central banks of countries and CBDC, a key point of distinction is that money
    held by a CBDC website or app will be the fiat equivalent of a deposit at the
    central bank of the CBDC issuer.[^(11)](#FPar1) This would represent a ***centralized
    type of digital money***, sometimes called ***e-money***, where a central authority
    maintains control over the money. To be clear this could be distinguished from
    the traditional concept of money that investors would store at a commercial bank
    instead of directly with the central bank of their respective country. Furthermore,
    the centralization of CBDCs is an important difference from cryptocurrencies such
    as Bitcoin which are ***decentralized types of digital money***, where there is
    no centralized government control or authority. The Bahamas launched what is considered

    for a number of reasons. One reason is it would allow country’s central banks
    to maintain more control over digital transactions as opposed to having them carried
    out almost exclusively over networks of private companies such as Apple Pay or
    Alipay. A second reason that central banks are increasingly recognizing the importance
    of CBDCs is because there is a general decline in the use of physical cash coupled
    with an adoption of various forms of digital forms of cash. This has spurred the
    desire by central banks to remain relevant while accepting the increasing realities
    of a transition to digitization. Highlighting this point, Deputy Governor of the
    Bank of Italy, Piero Cipollone, stated in a February 2021 interview, “*in an environment
    where cash is used less and less by both the customer and the merchant because

    Particularly, the work of private sector companies’ stablecoin proposals, such
    as the announcement of Facebook’s Libra project in 2019, has spurred the exploratory
    work of central banks in the area of CBDCs.[^(37)](#FPar1) A January 2021 survey
    by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an international organization
    of central banks, found that central banks collectively representing a fifth of
    the world's population are likely to launch retail CBDCs in the next three years
    and this timeline may likely be further sped up by the implications of the Covid19
    pandemic.[^(38)](#FPar1)

    on a country’s monetary policy, and overall financial stability. For example,
    in one study a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with sticky
    prices and adjustment costs was built to study the macroeconomic effects of CBDCs.[^(39)](#FPar1)
    This study also assumed a one-for-one exchange of CBDC with government debt, such
    as a US Dollar. The study concluded that by introducing the CBDC under a one-to-one
    exchange ratio there would be a decrease in interest rates and distortionary taxes,
    thus increasing long-run GDP.

    known as ***bank runs***. A bank run is when many clients of a bank all seek to
    withdraw their money at one time. This creates a problem for banks that utilize
    what is known as a fractional-reserve system, where only a portion of deposits
    is maintained on hand by the bank as cash. Once a large number of deposits are
    requested at a single time, or very close together, the bank therefore does not
    have enough cash on hand to meet their requests and the bank can ultimately become
    insolvent. Bank runs often occur during times of broader economic stress such
    as during the Great Depression from 1929 and into the early 1930s.

    referred to as the ***unbanked*** and ***underbanked***. Unbanked individuals
    are those that do not use banks in any way, and this includes not maintaining
    a checking or saving account. Instead, the unbanked rely on other types of alternative
    financial services from other institutions. These include other services, such
    as short-term payday loan, prepaid credit cards and money orders. Underbanked
    individuals do utilize banking institutions they do so on a limited basis in conjunction
    with alternative financial services.

    Firstly, the use of alternative financial services often comes with increased
    fees as compared to traditional banking products. Secondly, being unbanked or
    underbanked can either totally prevent or at the very least stymie the ability
    of an individual to build a credit history. This lack of credit history can negatively
    impact an individual’s ability to secure a loan. Thirdly, when not using the traditional
    banking channels the unbanked and underbanked do not have access to traditional
    banking products and online tools. Further exacerbating the problem is that unbanked
    and underbanked individuals are often low-income families who feel the impacts
    associated with higher fees and inability to take out loans more harshly than
    higher income families.[^(40)](#FPar1) Research has suggested that while CBDCs
    will address problems related to theft in areas such as interest payments to the
    unbanked and underbanked, but that this may have unintended consequences for households
    that are banked (i.e., not unbanked) unless they also hold CBDC in their portfolios.[^(41)](#FPar1)

    larger category of ***digital assets***. To clarify the term digital asset can
    have meaning outside of the context of something that can be invested in. Digital
    assets can most broadly be defined as anything that can be stored digitally. Historically,
    digital assets included content such as images, photos and text files. These can
    be referred to a content-related digital assets. People would use these types
    of digital assets in a number of ways to facilitate work activities such as information
    storage and sharing. People don’t make investments in things like Microsoft Word

    will be the focus of our discussion here. Before proceeding with our conversation
    of investable digital assets we need to first clarify some important terminology.
    To start with, the term digital asset is often confused with the term crypto asset.
    For the purposes of our discussion here we will define a ***crypto asset*** as
    a type of digital asset that is distinguished by its use of cryptography.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Cryptography*** can be defined as the enciphering and deciphering of messages
    in secret code or cipher. Cryptography is also equated with encryption; however,
    they are not exactly the same thing. Encryption is a type of cryptography in which
    information is transformed into a different format in an attempt to make it unrecognizable
    from its original form. Decryption is the process of reversing the encryption
    to decode the data into its original recognizable format. One of the key purposes
    of encryption is to prevent bad actors, sometimes called adversaries, from accessing
    information that they should not be. Modern encryption and decryption processes
    are typically performed by computer through the use of complex cryptographic algorithms.'

    are cryptocurrencies and ***crypto tokens***. Cryptocurrencies have their own
    blockchains.[^(43)](#FPar1) These can be distinguished from crypto tokens that
    are built and developed on pre-existing blockchains. We are using the term ***blockchain***
    here but have not formally defined it as yet. For the purposes of our discussion,
    we can think of blockchain as simply a ledger in which the records of transactions
    occur. These transactions are stored in so-called ***information blocks***, that
    are chained together. There are both public blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
    and private blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key goal of blockchains is to provide ***non-repudiation*** which means irrefutable
    proof that a transaction occurred. This proof comes in the forms of cryptographic
    evidence in the ledger, and different blockchains demonstrate this proof in different
    ways. An important aspect of these data blocks is that they are generally thought
    to be immutable and cannot be changed easily. We use the term generally immutable
    here because exploits have been found in public blockchains that have caused changes
    in blocks resulting in financial losses. An example of this was the June 2016
    hack of the Ethereum-based smart contract called The DAO. A vulnerability was
    found in The DAO’s code which allowed funds to be drained and losses in excess
    of $50 million to occur.[^(44)](#FPar1)

- en: It is important to note that blockchains are not the same thing as distributed
    ledgers but rather, blockchain is a type of distributed ledger. The broader category
    of distributed ledger technology, often abbreviated DLT, is implemented through
    the use of nodes (i.e., independent computers) that are utilized to document,
    synchronize and share transactions in a respective electronic ledger.[^(45)](#FPar1)
    A key benefit of DLT is that the data contained across the ledgers is decentralized
    and replicated across the nodes. This is as opposed to the centralization that
    is in place in traditional ledgers. We will discuss blockchains and their associated
    technology in more detail in Chapter [7](513667_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml).

    allocate to the crypto space. The first option was to allocate capital to a third-party
    manager who would then make investments into the crypto space on their investor's
    behalf. The second option was for an investor to allocate capital directly to
    the crypto space themselves. Within this latter direct investment option, there
    are actually several different methods by which these direct investments can be
    made. The term, “direct investment” in this context could be better classified
    as an investment that is managed directly by an investor, as opposed to a third-party
    manager. This would be in contrast to the actual nature or method of the actual
    investment being made.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first and most straightforward direct investment method would be for an
    investor to go to the markets and directly purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. This is not the only way by which direct investing can occur. A second
    way an investor can gain exposure to the crypto space under a direct investment
    model (i.e., one in which the investor controls the capital) would be through
    the use of derivatives. At their most basic level, a derivative is something that
    derived its value from something else. In a financial context, this value is derived
    from an underlying financial asset. An example of a derivative would be an options
    contract whose value is based on the value of an underlying publicly traded stocks.
    Other examples of derivatives could include futures contracts on a wide range
    of underlying assets ranging from stock indices and currencies to commodities
    such as oil, soybeans and livestock such as lean hogs.

    common uses of derivatives is for risk management purposes. This is commonly referred
    to as ***hedging risk***. An example of the way this works in practice would be
    if an investor owns a share of Google stock. They want to keep holding the share
    of Google stock (i.e., the underlying financial asset) but they want to protect
    themselves in the case of large declines in the price of the stock. Derivatives
    such as put options contracts can be employed to minimize losses in the event
    of declines while still allowing the investor to maintain a position in the underlying
    asset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common use of derivatives is to make a speculative bet on the future
    price of an underlying asset without owning the underlying itself. Continuing
    our example, if an investor felt the price of Google stock was going to rise substantially,
    they could buy a Google call option to implement this strategy. One reason an
    investor would do this, instead of simply buying a share of the underlying Google
    stock, would be because it is often much cheaper to purchase options than a position
    in the underlying asset. The ability to invest in derivatives with a much smaller
    outlay of capital, as compared to buying a position in the underlying asset, also
    allows investors to capitalize on the leverage capabilities afforded by derivatives.
    This leverage, also referred to as gearing, can magnify the gains associated with
    derivatives but can also greatly magnify the losses and, therefore, is often considered
    a riskier investment option as opposed to owning the underlying asset.

    a non-deliverable forward contract based on the relative value of the U.S. Dollar
    and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the Bitcoin Swap). On October 8, 2014, the only
    two market participants authorized at that time to trade on Tera’s SEF entered
    into two transactions in the Bitcoin Swap. The transactions were for the same
    notional amount, price, and tenor, and had the effect of completely offsetting
    each other. At the time, these were the only transactions on Tera’s SEF.

    Tera brought together the market participants, telling one that the trade would

    to the Order.

    statements at a meeting of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC)
    announcing the transactions, creating the impression of actual trading interest

    meeting indicated that the October 8 transactions were pre-arranged wash sales

    Bitcoin futures exchange accounting for approximately 19% or $2.1 billion of the

    symbol ETH.[^(74)](#FPar1) It is likely that the continued expansion of the crypto
    derivatives market will likely continue. One reason supporting this continued
    expansion is the likely continued increases in the total market capitalization
    of the entire crypto space. Additionally, as more of the capital flowing into
    the crypto space represents that of institutional investors, as compared to retail
    investors, the demand for more sophisticated risk management capabilities provided
    by products such as derivatives will likely increase.

    for investments in physically settled derivative products.[^(75)](#FPar1) Increasingly,
    physical settled Bitcoin futures have gained increased traction and have surpassed
    cash-settled Bitcoin futures during certain periods.[^(76)](#FPar1) Physical settlement
    derivatives transactions involve the actual physical delivery of products, in
    this case Bitcoins at the settlement date of the contract. By contrast to physical
    settlement, the above referenced CME BTC futures contract is cash settled.[^(77)](#FPar1)
    As the name implies, in cash settlement derivative transaction, the buyers and
    sellers of the transaction would net their positions at the end of the contract
    and would pay or receive cash from each other depending on their relative positions
    in the contract.

    and operations. It began by outlining the historical role of fiat money and discussing
    the characteristics of cryptocurrencies. Next, we discussed the development of
    Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). We then proceeded to outline the distinctions
    between different types of digital assets including tokens and stablecoins. We
    then discussed the role derivatives play in cryptocurrency investing. Now that
    we have established an understanding of the fundamentals of the cryptocurrency
    space in the next chapter, we will discuss the operational procedures involved
    in launching a cryptocurrency investment fund.
