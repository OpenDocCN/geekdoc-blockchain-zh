    lots of time and energy to a larger project, and there’s nothing wrong with that!
    Here is a fast project that you can do in an hour or less!Crochet ScrunchieThere
    is so much to love about this crochet scrunchie pattern. It can be made with countless
    color and texture combinations, so feel free to get creative and try it out with
    all your favorite yarns.Materials:●     Any bulky 5 or medium weight yarn●     H
    5.0 mm hook●     Yarn needle●     Scissors●     Plain hair tieStep 1: Attach the
    yarn to the hair tie by using an SC. Continue around the hair tie until it is
    covered, about 12 SC. SL ST into first SC to complete.Step 2: DC approx. 150 times
    around. This can depend on the size of your hair tie and the type of yarn being
    used. The yarn should take on a “scrunched up” look.Step 3: SL ST into the top
    of the first DC of that round.Step 4: Fasten off the yarn and weave in the loose
    ends using a yarn needle. Your scrunchie is complete!Crochet-Along ProjectsYou
    may be asking yourself: What is a crochet-along?Crochet-alongs, commonly referred
    to as CALs, are essentially a larger group of crocheters that are all working
    together on the same, big project at the same pace. Many CALs are offered for
    crocheters of all skill levels, so that even absolute beginners can participate.CALs
    are a great way to connect with the crocheting community and share ideas. People
    host CALs on many social media platforms and websites, so if this sounds like
    something you’d find interesting, finding one to join is only an internet search
    away.![A group of people sitting on a log  Description automatically generated

    point and 3 SC around each chain space. Join with the first DC.Step 13: Chain

    handles.Step 14: SC in each stitch around the rim of the basket (or along handles,
