  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, the first factor is the real benefit of using a particular currency.
    The second one is the belief in the growth of an ecosystem of this coin. The third
    factor is the belief in the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole,
    i.e. the belief that most businesses will want to use the cryptocurrency system.
    The last factors of pricing are the extra charges for the deficit and future profit
    as well as the risk discount.

- en: Also, it happens quite often that various speculations and demand for a coin
    raise its price in disproportion to its intrinsic value. The most important thing
    here is to find out the percentage ratio between a soap bubble and something really
    efficient. There is no exact algorithm for calculating this ratio. Therefore,
    everyone solves this task relying only on own views.

    is, you simply enter this query into the Google search engine and any resource
    will give you the same information. However, it won’t fly with cryptocurrency.
    The cryptocurrency exchanges are local, and cryptocurrency trading resembles the
    Forex market. In other words, it is an over-the-counter market. There is no central
    market where you can track the value of a certain currency. As a rule, members
    of the cryptocurrency community view prices at different sites, which vary in
    regional terms, and the price gap may reach ten to twenty percent.

    on the [GIT HUB](https://github.com/) site, the most popular resource that unites

    exchanges. Here you may read about each currency and view its current rate to
    another currency, including the US dollar.

    column (Market Cap) shows capitalization of the currency. How is it calculated?
    It is very simple. The amount of currency that is circulating in the market now
    (Circulating Supply) is multiplied by the price (Pricе).

- en: If you want to invest in cryptocurrency, I recommend that you choose among top
    10 or at least top 20 best cryptocurrencies. The rest are not reliable and can
    demonstrate both ups and downs. These currencies with lower rank have bigger volatility,
    posing a significant risk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Volatility is good for professional traders since they are able to manage risks
    and the price dispersion offers greater opportunities for making money. At the
    same time, volatility is bad for a novice or an investor. That is why most funds
    tend to buy only the top 10 best cryptocurrencies. Yes, sometimes new cryptocurrencies,
    which have only recently appeared in the market and already managed to attract
    a huge amount of money, hit this list. But they do not stay among best for long.
    An example of such a cryptocurrency is IOTA. The capitalization of this currency
    has already declined almost twofold since it entered the market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would also like to say a few words specifically to Bitcoin fans. Now there
    is a huge amount of different cryptocurrencies in the market, so it would be very
    foolish to fixate on just one option. Indeed, Bitcoin is the most reliable cryptocurrency
    and is growing rapidly. However, these days there are plenty other interesting
    cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin. Each of them has its own advantages.

    an audit of its code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'After all, as I wrote earlier, all cryptocurrencies are open-source: they utilize
    the open-source code and are similar to each other. In fact, any person can get
    the code for Bitcoin, for instance, change some parameters, and thus invent a
    new cryptocurrency. To be blunt, this is the way the fork appears.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fork is the use of the code base of a software project as a start for another
    one. Each such project can develop independently from the main one and can realize
    the opportunities which the main project lacks. The process of creation of such
    cryptocurrencies is called forking.

    coins are called Bitcoin forks.

    Therefore, it turns out that it is actually impossible to have a diversified investment
    portfolio, i.e. to distribute risks by holding more than one currency.

- en: Litecoin is the first currency I want to focus on. In my opinion, it is one
    of the safest currencies after Bitcoin. It was created in 2011 and is a Bitcoin
    fork, i.e. the code of this coin is based on the Bitcoin source code. Litecoin
    block generates every 2.5 minutes. About 84 million Litecoins are now in circulation,
    which is four times more than the number of Bitcoins. In addition, Litecoin already
    has SegWit, which was activated on the Bitcoin network only on August 1, 2017.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lighting Network has also been recently activated in Litecoin. Lighting Network
    is an off-chain micropayment system with exceptionally low fees. If you think
    it is not important, then just believe me, it is really of a landmark nature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, Litecoin is a modern, fast-paced currency. I recommend you have both
    Bitcoin and Litecoin in your investment portfolio. Bitcoin as a very reliable
    currency and Litecoin is used for conducting experiments which can later be applied
    to Bitcoin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zcash is another quite interesting coin to pay attention to. It is the most
    anonymous coin available today. It uses zero-knowledge proofs, a building block
    for greater financial and data privacy in cryptocurrencies. Only professional
    developers understand how it works. Nevertheless, the protocol of this coin is
    now used in many Blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The value of this currency was immediately more than $4,000 when it appeared.
    In other words, the recoupment of mining for one day was 100%. However, the price
    of this coin fell sharply after a while.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here I want to move your attention to a very important issue. People are often
    inclined to buy up cryptocurrency, falling for the hype. In other words, they
    buy a particular coin only because a lot of other people do so, not realizing
    that can be done for speculative reasons, not because the coin has any real value.
    As a consequence, you can be in the red for a very long time. This is why I recommend
    you not fall for the hype of a new kind of cryptocurrency and just keep your coins
    in your wallet so you can earn much more.

    appeared.

- en: In June 2016, perhaps the most massive attack in the history of the cryptocurrency
    industry happened. A very promising and popular project The DAO lost more than
    $60 million due to a mistake in the code. But let's back up a moment first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DAO is the largest crowdfunding project ever. It was the first Ethereum-based
    decentralied autonomous organization and a form of investor-directed venture capital
    funds. When buying tokens in this organization, you got into a certain company,
    which you could remotely control by voting. Put simply; it was a whole corporation
    where people could reach agreements, choose investment instruments, and then get
    dividends from the company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, one day a certain person found a loophole in The DAO algorithm and
    stole tokens worth about $60 million. Later, this person stated he had done nothing
    illegal as he had not cracked the code. He even warned he was ready to defend
    his position in court.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The action of this person provoked a real panic because many users lost their
    money. Also, the situation with The DAO very much affected the Ethereum itself.
    The Ether price immediately dropped by 50%. That's why founder of Ethereum Vitalik
    Buterin was forced to make a centralized decision to save the situation. He decided
    to create a fork.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two types of fork: soft fork and hard fork. Soft fork is a change
    to the software protocol where only previously valid blocks/transactions are made
    invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is
    backwards-compatible. Hard fork is a radical change to the protocol that makes
    previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa). Hard fork is a permanent
    divergence from the previous version of the Blockchain, and the newest version
    will no longer accept nodes running previous versions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vitalik Buterin suggested creating a soft fork, i.e. to roll back all transactions
    on the network until the moment of the theft. Initially, all The DAO members consented
    to his proposal, but then some people appeared who said they were not ready for
    such a centralized change. It is because of those people the hard fork took place.
    Ether split into two currencies. The first and basic is Ethereum Classic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the way, there are some forecasts that after Ethereum switches from Proof
    of Work to Proof of Stake, as we mentioned above (i.e. when part of the coins
    will be mined, and the nodes will guarantee the other), many miners will earn
    less on Ether. They are likely to switch to Ethereum Classic. I think this situation
    can cause the growth of this currency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let’s consider Dash currency. This currency is a tool for intraday trading.
    This coin is very technical regarding charts. It works on a partial Proof of Work
    and Proof of Stake system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, it is a wonderful currency for everyday spending. Also, Dash
    offers a masternode tool, which is only expected to be launched on Ethereum platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This currency has a great future if it will be the first one to provide an opportunity
    to transfer money easily and pay for purchases. For example, a project called
    Dash Evolution is being developed now. It is habitual online banking, which is
    already called the best alternative to PayPal. It is expected to be completed
    by the end of 2017\. I predict that the project will be praised by users who do
    not support cryptocurrency anarchism or rigid decentralization but just want to
    take advantage of cryptocurrency for making transactions and holding their money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another great advantage of this currency is anonymity. The coins are mixed with
    every new transfer of this currency, making it rather difficult to track a transaction
    on your wallets. Bitcoin has a separate service for mixing coins, but this happens
    automatically when using Dash.

- en: The next coin for discussion is Waves, created by Russian programmer Alexander
    Ivanov. The Waves platform allows you to create your own tokens in a few clicks
    and sell them immediately. They are traded on the decentraliszd Waves exchange,
    and any person who buys tokens from you can immediately try to sell them on this
    exchange. It will take just 5-10 minutes to create your own tokens on Waves.

    they do not require complex programming.

    in jest. No one expected it would circulate. In any case, this coin has no value
    and is practically never used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Dogecoin price is deliberately screwed up now and then, and people gladly
    participate in this amusement. The person who is the last to buy the coin at the
    highest price, loses money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And a few words about Namecoin. It is a Bitcoin fork which allows you to buy
    a .bit website, i.e. a decentralized hosting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me also mention some rather unreliable currencies. Ripple is an example
    of such cryptocurrency (although many have already earned much on it).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ripple is a centralized currency. It is controlled by a consortium of banks,
    the largest of which are located in Japan. This coin started to grow after Bitcoin
    had been legalized in Japan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A significant disadvantage of this currency is that you lose a certain amount
    of Ripple when, for example, you transfer dollars or euros to someone. And so
    the question arises: how does this affect the exchange rate, depending on the
    number of transactions?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you want to create a wallet, you will have to look for it on [gatehub.net](https://gatehub.net/).

- en: Now let's summarize. At the time of writing this book, a total of 804 cryptocurrencies
    exist. But I do not advise you to study all of them, just the top ten. You can
    invest beyond thistop ten only when you start making profit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let me give you some practical advice. So before choosing a currency for investment,
    I recommend reflecting on the composition of your investment portfolio (I'm talking
    about passive portfolio investment). If you want to have the top three best cryptocurrencies
    in it, then consider what can affect the price of these currencies shortly. You
    also need to carefully analyze the markets on which this currency is traded and
    watch the daily charts to estimate the turnover of your currency in last 24 hours.

- en: Finally, I want to remind you once again that cryptocurrency market provides
    no guarantees. If you have read information about more or less reliable coins,
    it does not mean this information is true. This is just my subjective opinion.
    Therefore, it is up to you to decide whether to buy particular coins or not.
