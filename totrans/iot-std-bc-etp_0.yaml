  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Digital transformation is the transformation of business and organizational
    activities, processes, competencies, and models to fully leverage the opportunities
    of a mix of digital technologies and their accelerating impact across industries
    in a strategic and prioritized way, with present and future shifts in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Digital transformation is not about technology, but it is a way for enterprises
    to do business and operations differently to remain competitive and be disruptive
    in their marketspace. To achieve this change, technology is utilized. Being digital
    requires enterprises to be open to reexamining their entire way of doing business
    and understanding where the new frontiers of value are and how technology can
    play a key role in bringing this value faster. In practice, end-to-end [customer
    experience](https://www.i-scoop.eu/customer-experience/) optimization, operational
    flexibility, and innovation are key drivers and goals of digital transformation,
    along with the development of new revenue sources and information-powered ecosystems
    of value, leading to business transformation and new forms of digital processes.

- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most widely spoken digital technologies
    that promises a lot of benefits to enterprises. IoT is all about connecting devices
    and factory equipment over the Internet. In other words, it is the convergence
    between Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OT is about (heavy) machineries, safety of people, and so on. There is almost
    zero tolerance toward downtime, errors, and safety. This is one of the core reasons
    why OT has always operated in a highly risk-averse manner. Another aspect of OT
    is that the machineries deployed at the factories cannot be upgraded or replaced
    at the same pace as IT systems, and these are the ones that will remain for years
    once purchased. This becomes a hurdle to deploy new innovative ideas on these
    machineries to make them more efficient. From a people perspective, these two
    departments (IT and OT) have traditionally and culturally not spent a lot of time
    together. A typical IT department is measured on system uptime, availability of
    applications and IT infrastructure, number of security breaches, and reducing
    costs of IT. On the other hand, the OT department constitutes of the factory managers,
    production managers, and even agriculture farmers. These are the folks who produce
    food, control the oil and gas process, or pump oil from the ground. An OT department
    is measured on entirely different success criteria, such as what is the yield
    of the crop, how much water is being used to create that yield, what is the production
    uptime of the factory, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IT and OT departments are two different worlds, and each department is measured
    very different on success. With IoT, both these departments need to come together,
    and this is where connecting people becomes equally important along with connecting
    things. Successful IoT use cases have provided several benefits to enterprises
    such as opening up new business opportunities and increased revenue along with
    powering enterprises with an ability to perform better operations and become more
    productive, more protected, and more profitable. A classic example is the smart
    fridge. Using IoT, a fridge could tell us it was out of milk, text us if its internal
    camera saw there was no milk left, or that the carton was past its expiry date.
    The benefits of IoT to enterprises are enormous if applied carefully, and this
    is one of the reasons why IoT has become so popular. However, IoT is in a very
    early stage of maturity, and several guidelines and ways of working are still
    being defined to bring standardization in IoT projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though IoT is a relatively new area for many enterprises, this cannot stop us
    on our journey toward excellence with IoT. The good news is that there are several
    guidelines, mature practices, tools, and technologies that have already been developed,
    and by carefully choosing the right ones, enterprises can achieve success with
    IoT. This book is one such step toward standardizing an end-to-end IoT implementation
    approach and is based on several best practices and successes in IoT that have
    been achieved in the past across multiple industries.

    IoT Standards, that will enable enterprises to do business better and achieve
    operational benefits using IoT.

- en: This book is an outcome of multiple successful engagements in IoT which I have
    led during the last several years. Finally, this book is also an outcome of my
    learnings and those of my colleagues on failed IoT projects – a combination which
    had helped me to define a solid methodology to execute large-scale enterprise-level
    IoT use case implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before officially releasing this methodology into the market, IoT Standards
    were implemented at several organizations. The methodology has demonstrated superior
    benefits when compared to any other guidance available in the industry today.
    There are several case studies described in the book, all of which are from experiences
    with real companies, but their names have been changed to disguise their identity.
