- en: I want to thank everyone who helped in the creation of my book. In technology
    projects, many in the role of client, employer, or colleague helped me directly
    or indirectly to obtain the proper image of the impact technology has on business.
    I would also thank the many online experts and content publishers who increased
    my knowledge of blockchain, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence.
