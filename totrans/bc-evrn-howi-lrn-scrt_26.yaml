    update for modern times. Imagine the market is a hormonal teenager called Moody
    McMarketson. Some days Moody is on top of the world. “I’ll give you $20,000 for
    a single bitcoin!” shouts Moody. “I just asked Jenny out to the prom and she said
    yes! Twenty grand for a bitcoin! Let’s do this!”

    bitcoin for $7,000.” Then he breaks down weeping.

    moods. We can calmly watch as Moody McMarketson goes through the emotional turbulence
    of adolescence. Tomorrow he’ll be back with a new price. And the day after that.
    We don’t have to take any of his offers. We can wait.

    offers are just downright nuts. When they get unreasonably low, we buy. And when
    they get unreasonably high, we sell.
