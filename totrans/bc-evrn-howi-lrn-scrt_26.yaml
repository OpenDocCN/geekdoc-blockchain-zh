    part was that I was getting heckled.

    I was constantly working on new material, and I welcomed the chance to practice.
    I would often record my talks, then watch them afterward, nipping and tucking.
    In comedy lingo, I was working on my “tight ten.”

    sitting at the front table. I was in the function room of an Italian restaurant
    on Cape Cod, speaking to a crowd of about thirty Rotarians. The mood had been
    fun-loving and jovial, until he interrupted me.

    to the projector screen, titled “Centralization vs. Decentralization.” “I was
    saying that most of the human institutions we’ve created have been centralized
    institutions. Governments. Corporations. The Church.”

    $20,000.

    pouring into the blockchain industry. So the value of the overall market, in theory,
    was even higher.

- en: The legendary investor Benjamin Graham had a funny analogy for this, which I’ll
    update for modern times. Imagine the market is a hormonal teenager called Moody
    McMarketson. Some days Moody is on top of the world. “I’ll give you $20,000 for
    a single bitcoin!” shouts Moody. “I just asked Jenny out to the prom and she said
    yes! Twenty grand for a bitcoin! Let’s do this!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other days Moody is down in the dumps. “Jenny stood me up,” he says, slumping
    onto your couch. He smells of Mountain Dew and Fritos. “I’ll sell you back that
    bitcoin for $7,000.” Then he breaks down weeping.

- en: Graham taught that intelligent investors don’t have to respond to any of these
    moods. We can calmly watch as Moody McMarketson goes through the emotional turbulence
    of adolescence. Tomorrow he’ll be back with a new price. And the day after that.
    We don’t have to take any of his offers. We can wait.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moody McMarketson’s prefrontal cortex has not fully evolved, so some of his
    offers are just downright nuts. When they get unreasonably low, we buy. And when
    they get unreasonably high, we sell.

- en: In the blockchain world, Moody is even moodier. The highs are stratospheric,
    and the lows are cataclysmic. But what’s low and what’s high? That’s where our
    investor judgment, informed by careful research and analysis, must override Moody’s
    moods.

- en: To beat the market, you must sometimes bet against the market. This is common
    sense. You’ve got to zig when everyone else is zagging and zag when everyone else
    is zigging. You’ve got to ignore the market’s moods.

    upward and approaching $20,000\. It’s not so easy when it’s in a prolonged slump

    look for great bargains and buy them when they’re not fashionable.'

    sitting on a store shelf with a giant red tag saying, 65% OFF.

    shows you that the market is undervaluing a token, buy. This is the opposite of
    what the market will be doing, and that’s how fortunes are made.
