- en: The primary objective of this book is to provide an in-depth understanding of
    blockchain technology and to demonstrate how to use it in a distributed setting
    or environment. The Blockchain technology employs several aspects of distributed
    networks and the distributed system is also connected to the majority of blockchain-based
    applications. As a result, you need a thorough understanding of emerging technologies
    in the distributed systems.

  zh: 本书的主要目标是深入理解区块链技术，并展示如何在分布式环境中使用它。区块链技术利用了分布式网络的几个方面，而分布式系统也与大多数基于区块链的应用程序相连接。因此，您需要对分布式系统中的新兴技术有透彻的了解。
- en: 'When you think of distributed systems, you must keep in mind that they are
    systems for which processing is distributed. This does not necessarily have to
    be physically distributed, but the processing components must be distributed and
    not united in a single block. This means that hardware and software architectures
    maintain the distributed system. Everything must be interconnected: the CPU through
    the network and the processes through the communication system. Distributed systems
    have infinite use cases, including electronic banking systems, massively multiplayer
    online games, and sensor networks.'

- en: '**Blockchain in the** **insurance sector** **:** In the insurance industry,
    blockchain enables safe and decentralized transactions, establishing a solid foundation
    for preventing fraud, providing more control, and improving data and reporting.
    Furthermore, insurance companies can have up-to-date, accurate notifications about
    changes, thanks to blockchain, which allows them to improve risk management and
    maximize capital and fund opportunities. It also allows for the possibility of
    implementing Big Data strategies, which are very useful for obtaining secure information
    about customers, priorities, and preferences.'

    applications in digital payments. Obviously, there are still many issues to be
    resolved, such as transaction processing time, which is still extremely sluggish
    when compared to the demands of the market and a fast-paced world. The system’s
    performance should be enhanced so it can be better absorbed by digital payments.
    Clear regulatory guidelines and a more thorough study of risks are two of blockchain’s
    problems in the digital payments industry. Despite these difficulties, there is
    potential for this new technology to be used in digital payments.'

    industry are numerous. There are several uses of blockchain in the agrifood business,
    ranging from decentralization to shared control to immutability and information
    conservation. Blockchain’s advantages appear to be particularly essential to the
    processing sector, as well as all operations and innovations linked to food certification.
    The blockchain allows users to establish open supply chains that include all of
    the players: raw material producers, logistics and transportation businesses,
    companies that work with raw materials at various stages of transformation, and
    companies that work with packaging and marketing. Finally, retail may pass along
    data and information to all other players while maintaining complete openness.'

    energy systems. The energy system operations and its markets and customers can
    all benefit from blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Blockchains provide
    disintermediation, transparency, and tamper-proof transactions, but they also

- en: To implement blockchain effectively in a distributed system, you first need
    to understand the blockchain technology and its related components in depth. These
    are covered in Chapters [2](520777_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)-[7](520777_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml).
    Since consensus algorithms are an important concept in a distributed system transaction,
    Chapter [8](520777_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml) includes a project related to this topic.

    ideas in distributed systems that are covered in Chapters [9](520777_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml)
    and [10](520777_1_En_10_Chapter.xhtml). (With real-time systems, the book explains
    how scheduling works. When many processes have the same demands and time restrictions
    and must be efficiently handled by the scheduling policy, this is known as *homogenous
    process scheduling* .)

    When modeling systems, the above-mentioned approach must be used. When using blockchain
    technology in a distributed system, you must model the blockchain layers as part
    of the distributed system modeling to get a clear image of the system architecture
    and the systems of systems (SoS) capabilities. The BLOCKLY 4SOS modeling approach
    is used to create all these models.
