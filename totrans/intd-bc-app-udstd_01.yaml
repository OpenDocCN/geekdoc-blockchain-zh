- en: The primary objective of this book is to provide an in-depth understanding of
    blockchain technology and to demonstrate how to use it in a distributed setting
    or environment. The Blockchain technology employs several aspects of distributed
    networks and the distributed system is also connected to the majority of blockchain-based
    applications. As a result, you need a thorough understanding of emerging technologies
    in the distributed systems.

    systems for which processing is distributed. This does not necessarily have to
    be physically distributed, but the processing components must be distributed and
    not united in a single block. This means that hardware and software architectures
    maintain the distributed system. Everything must be interconnected: the CPU through
    the network and the processes through the communication system. Distributed systems
    have infinite use cases, including electronic banking systems, massively multiplayer
    online games, and sensor networks.'

    it is good to know about these technologies in depth. Let’s look at a few examples.

    blockchain enables safe and decentralized transactions, establishing a solid foundation
    for preventing fraud, providing more control, and improving data and reporting.
    Furthermore, insurance companies can have up-to-date, accurate notifications about
    changes, thanks to blockchain, which allows them to improve risk management and
    maximize capital and fund opportunities. It also allows for the possibility of
    implementing Big Data strategies, which are very useful for obtaining secure information
    about customers, priorities, and preferences.'

    applications in digital payments. Obviously, there are still many issues to be
    resolved, such as transaction processing time, which is still extremely sluggish
    when compared to the demands of the market and a fast-paced world. The system’s
    performance should be enhanced so it can be better absorbed by digital payments.
    Clear regulatory guidelines and a more thorough study of risks are two of blockchain’s
    problems in the digital payments industry. Despite these difficulties, there is
    potential for this new technology to be used in digital payments.'

    industry are numerous. There are several uses of blockchain in the agrifood business,
    ranging from decentralization to shared control to immutability and information
    conservation. Blockchain’s advantages appear to be particularly essential to the
    processing sector, as well as all operations and innovations linked to food certification.
    The blockchain allows users to establish open supply chains that include all of
    the players: raw material producers, logistics and transportation businesses,
    companies that work with raw materials at various stages of transformation, and
    companies that work with packaging and marketing. Finally, retail may pass along
    data and information to all other players while maintaining complete openness.'

    platforms open to all energy system stakeholders. For example, Power Ledger is
    an Australian startup involved in a variety of blockchain applications for renewable
    energy systems. The energy system operations and its markets and customers can
    all benefit from blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Blockchains provide
    disintermediation, transparency, and tamper-proof transactions, but they also
    provide unique ways for consumers and small renewable providers to participate
    more actively in the energy market and monetize their assets.'

- en: To implement blockchain effectively in a distributed system, you first need
    to understand the blockchain technology and its related components in depth. These
    are covered in Chapters [2](520777_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)-[7](520777_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml).
    Since consensus algorithms are an important concept in a distributed system transaction,
    Chapter [8](520777_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml) includes a project related to this topic.

    ideas in distributed systems that are covered in Chapters [9](520777_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml)
    and [10](520777_1_En_10_Chapter.xhtml). (With real-time systems, the book explains
    how scheduling works. When many processes have the same demands and time restrictions
    and must be efficiently handled by the scheduling policy, this is known as *homogenous
    process scheduling* .)

    When modeling systems, the above-mentioned approach must be used. When using blockchain
    technology in a distributed system, you must model the blockchain layers as part
    of the distributed system modeling to get a clear image of the system architecture
    and the systems of systems (SoS) capabilities. The BLOCKLY 4SOS modeling approach
    is used to create all these models.

- en: To model SoS systems, you must include BLOCKLY 4SOS as part of model-driven
    engineering. In Chapters [11](520777_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml) and [12](520777_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml),
    these topics are discussed in detail.

    all of these approaches. The book presents five projects. They were created using
    a variety of programming languages, and Chapters [13](520777_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml)-[17](520777_1_En_17_Chapter.xhtml)
    include source code and modeling languages. For each project, the components of
    cyber-physical systems are also discussed.
