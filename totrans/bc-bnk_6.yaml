- en: The banking industry is in the midst of major changes, and banks are facing
    several challenges. On the one hand, recent advances in technologies have had
    a significant impact on the expectations and behaviours of consumers, who are
    now demanding better-quality and more customised services and products. At the
    same time, new technologies are increasing competition in the industry, opening
    the doors to many new entrants (e.g. fintech firms and technology providers) seeking
    to offer financial services in innovative ways and provide a better user experience.
    On the other hand, new technologies are enabling banks to improve the efficiency
    of the processes underlying their offer of financial services. In this regard,
    new technologies can be instrumental in improving the quality of the services
    being offered to clients and ensure that they have a competitive edge.

  zh: 银行业正在经历重大变革，银行面临着几个挑战。一方面，技术的最新进展对消费者的期望和行为产生了重大影响，他们现在要求更高质量和更定制化的服务和产品。与此同时，新技术正在增加行业内的竞争，为许多新进入者（例如金融科技公司和技术提供商）敞开大门，他们寻求以创新方式提供金融服务并提供更好的用户体验。另一方面，新技术使银行能够提高其金融服务基础流程的效率。在这方面，新技术可以在提高向客户提供的服务质量并确保他们具有竞争优势方面发挥关键作用。
- en: 'In this environment, an innovation that is relevant for the banking industry
    is blockchain technology—a decentralised and distributed ledger that is constantly
    updated and allows for the recording of transactions and the tracking of assets
    in a given network (Swan [2015](#CR15); Crosby et al. [2016](#CR3); Walport [2016](#CR18)).
    It started as the technology underlying Bitcoin (Nakamoto [2008](#CR9))—that is,
    first-generation blockchain (Blockchain 1.0.), which has been used to allow the
    recording of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) transactions—and has become
    a tool facilitating the process of recording any transaction type and tracking
    the movement of any asset. These uses have made it applicable to multiple areas
    in the form of second-generation blockchain (Blockchain 2.0) onwards (Ulieru [2016](#CR17);
    Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR6); Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR16)). Specifically,
    blockchain represents a break and a more efficient alternative from the centralised
    data repositories that have historically been used to support transaction processing
    (Yermack [2017](#CR19)): by combining several computer technologies, including
    distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms and
    cryptography functions, blockchain can solve the problems of traditional databases
    (i.e. centralised systems). Blockchain allows fast, low-cost and secure transactions
    without the need for third parties.'

  zh: 在这种环境下，对银行业有关的一项创新是区块链技术——一种分散和分布式账本，不断更新，并允许在给定网络中记录交易和追踪资产（Swan [2015](#CR15);
    Crosby et al. [2016](#CR3); Walport [2016](#CR18)）。它起初是比特币的底层技术（Nakamoto [2008](#CR9)）——也就是第一代区块链（区块链1.0），用于记录比特币（和其他加密货币）交易，并成为一种工具，促进了记录任何交易类型和追踪任何资产的过程。这些用途使其在第二代区块链（区块链2.0）及以后的形式中适用于多个领域（Ulieru
    [2016](#CR17); Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR6); Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR16)）。具体来说，区块链代表着一种突破和更有效的替代方案，远离了过去用于支持交易处理的集中式数据存储库（Yermack
    [2017](#CR19)）：通过结合包括分布式数据存储、点对点传输、共识机制和密码学功能在内的多种计算机技术，区块链可以解决传统数据库（即集中式系统）的问题。区块链可以实现快速、低成本和安全的交易，而无需第三方参与。
- en: Thanks to the characteristics of the underlying technology, blockchain has been
    widely acknowledged as a disruptive force in the financial sector and a key source
    of future financial market innovation because it undermines the traditional business
    models still used in many financial service transactions. Concerning the banking
    industry, in particular, numerous studies (e.g. MacDonald et al. [2016](#CR7);
    Buitenhek [2016](#CR2); Guo and Liang [2016](#CR5); Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR12);
    Yermack [2019](#CR20); Stulz [2019](#CR14)) argue that blockchain can create new
    opportunities for banks and pose new threats to their business. In this regard,
    this study underscores the importance of differentiating between the various types
    and uses of blockchain technology.

- en: First-generation blockchain—i.e. blockchain used to launch cryptocurrencies
    (usually public blockchains)—poses a threat to banks because blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    (like Bitcoin) are tools that can be used to disintermediate banks. Specifically,
    blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies enables new players (e.g. blockchain-based
    start-ups) to enter the market and offer products and services that have traditionally
    been banking products, as well as new and innovative ones, at a lower price, thereby
    increasing competition in the banking industry. This may cause banks to lose their
    market shares and, consequently, jeopardises their profitability. Conversely,
    second-generation blockchain—i.e. the adoption of the distributed ledger technology
    (DLT) of blockchain that provides banking services (usually private blockchains
    )—gives banks an opportunity since the technology can improve the quality of the
    services they offer their clients. In particular, by automating such processes
    and eliminating the parties involved in the operations , blockchain’s DLT can
    enhance the efficiency of middle and back-office processes and, consequently,
    improve the products and services the banks offer their customers. Activities
    like lending , payments , trade finance and capital markets are the main banking
    areas that may benefit from adopting the technology, which can cut costs and increase
    transaction speeds. In addition, as discussed in Chapter [3](490216_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml),
    blockchain can allow banks to create new product and services and reach new potential
    customers (i.e. unbanked and underbanked populations), thus generating new and
    potentially important revenue streams. Through these three channels (i.e. efficiency
    improvements , product innovation and new market segments), blockchain technology
    can positively affect banks’ profitability and represent an important source of
    competitive edge.

  zh: 第一代区块链，即用于发行加密货币的区块链（通常是公共区块链），对银行构成威胁，因为区块链和加密货币（如比特币）是可以用来解除银行中介的工具。具体而言，与加密货币相关的区块链使得新的参与者（如基于区块链的初创企业）能够进入市场，并提供传统银行产品以及新颖产品和服务，而且价格更低，从而增加银行业竞争。这可能导致银行失去市场份额，进而危及其盈利能力。相反，第二代区块链，即采用区块链的分布式账本技术（通常是私有区块链）来提供银行服务，给银行提供了机会，因为这项技术可以提高他们为客户提供的服务质量。特别是，通过自动化这些流程并消除参与操作的各方，区块链的分布式账本技术可以提高中后台流程的效率，进而改善银行为客户提供的产品和服务。贷款、支付、贸易融资和资本市场等活动是可能受益于采用这项技术的主要银行业务领域，这可以降低成本并提高交易速度。此外，正如第[3](490216_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml)章所讨论的，区块链可以让银行创造新的产品和服务，并接触到新的潜在客户（即无银行账户和无法充分利用银行服务的人口），从而创造新的、具有重要潜力的收入来源。通过这三个渠道（即效率改进、产品创新和新的市场细分），区块链技术可以积极影响银行的盈利能力，并成为一个重要的竞争优势来源。

- en: Building on the framework of the Business Model Canvas by Osterwalder and Pigneur
    ([2010](#CR11)), this study shows that blockchain’s potential impact on banks
    ’ business models could be broad, with all the elements of a bank’s business model
    significantly affected. As discussed in Chapter [4](490216_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    blockchain can enable banks to offer their customers a new value proposition,
    namely providing traditional products and services more efficiently and creating
    and offering new ones that are not necessarily associated with traditional banking
    products but are tailored to meet customers’ individual needs. For this reason,
    innovation will become a central element of a bank’s strategy. Moreover, the technology
    can allow banks to open new market segments, thereby reaching a multitude of new
    potential customers. This will require banks to rethink their key internal resources
    and activities, as well as their partnerships, to make the new value proposition
    possible. First, banks will need to move outside of their traditional resources
    to improve their ability to deal with and leverage the technology in order to
    foster innovative solutions. In particular, human resources capable of understanding
    the technology and translate it into costs and economy of scale (e.g. blockchain
    experts, technologists, IT experts, etc.), as well as resources that can help
    to develop and exploit the vast and diversified quantity of information recorded
    in the distributed ledger (e.g. data scientists), will be key enablers of the
    new business models. At the same time, activities like *data analytics* *, research
    & development* and *customer relationship management* will be major factors driving
    innovation in banks and, in this way, become more valuable than they ever were
    before. In this regard, collaboration with other financial institutions, technology
    firms (e.g. blockchain-based start-ups) and universities will be crucial for banks
    to acquire particular resources or perform certain activities.

  zh: 在奥斯特瓦尔德和皮涅尔（[2010](#CR11)）的商业模式画布框架基础上，本研究表明，区块链对银行业务模式的潜在影响可能是广泛的，银行业务模式的所有要素都会受到显著影响。
    正如第4章[4](490216_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml)所讨论的那样，区块链可以使银行能够向客户提供一个新的价值主张，即更有效地提供传统产品和服务，并创造并提供新的产品，这些产品不一定与传统银行产品相关，而是量身定制以满足客户的个性化需求。
    因此，创新将成为银行战略的核心要素。 此外，该技术可以使银行开拓新的市场细分，从而达到大量新潜在客户。 这将要求银行重新思考其关键内部资源和活动，以及其合作伙伴关系，以使新的价值主张成为可能。
    首先，银行需要超越其传统资源，以提高其处理和利用技术的能力，从而促进创新解决方案。 特别是，能够理解技术并将其翻译成成本和规模经济（例如区块链专家，技术专家，IT专家等）的人力资源，以及能够帮助开发和利用分布式分类账中记录的大量多样化信息的资源（例如数据科学家），将成为新业务模式的关键推动因素。
    同时，*数据分析*，*研发*和*客户关系管理*等活动将成为银行推动创新的主要因素，并因此变得比以往任何时候更有价值。 在这方面，与其他金融机构，技术公司（例如基于区块链的初创公司）和大学的合作对于银行获取特定资源或执行特定活动将至关重要。

    suggests that blockchain can change the status quo and lead to new business models
    in banking. To date, however, it has been difficult to assess how and to what
    extent blockchain can affect the traditional banking business model.

- en: Although blockchain continues to develop at a rapid pace, with numerous large
    banks investing and experimenting with the technology, recent evidence (Bank of
    Italy [2019](#CR1); EBA [2019](#CR4)) shows that most blockchain projects in banks
    are still in the development phase. Moreover, some restrictions on the widespread
    adoption of blockchain persist and have to be addressed. This relates particularly
    to the interoperability among different types of blockchains and compliance with
    existing regulatory frameworks. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that
    much has been done over the years to face such challenges. As discussed in Chapter
    [5](490216_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml), regulators and authorities around the world
    have been actively assessing compatibility with the current regulatory framework
    and identifying any regulatory “gaps” and potential risks. To this end, numerous
    initiatives, including the revision of existing rules and/or the introduction
    of new ones, have been undertaken to promote the development of the technology
    in compliance with the existing regulatory framework. At the same time, banks
    are actively collaborating with each other and with other stakeholders (governments
    , universities, etc.) to promote the development of the technology and its applications
    in financial services. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that further action is
    still needed to enable blockchain to flourish.

  zh: 尽管区块链仍在快速发展，许多大型银行都在投资和尝试这项技术，但最近的证据（意大利银行[2019](#CR1); 欧洲银行[2019](#CR4)）显示，大多数银行的区块链项目仍处于开发阶段。此外，一些限制仍然存在，阻碍着区块链的普及和应对。这尤其涉及不同类型区块链之间的互操作性以及与现有监管框架的合规性。值得指出的是，多年来在应对这些挑战方面取得了不小的成就。如《第5章》所述，世界各地的监管机构和权威机构一直在积极评估与当前监管框架的兼容性，并识别任何监管上的“空白”和潜在风险。为此，已经采取了许多倡议，包括修订现有规则和/或引入新规则，以促进技术的发展并符合现有的监管框架。与此同时，银行积极与彼此以及其他利益相关者（政府，大学等）合作，推动技术在金融服务中的应用。然而，值得注意的是，尚需要进一步的行动才能使区块链得以蓬勃发展。
- en: With the technology advancing at an accelerated pace, academic research should
    also offer an important contribution to the understanding of the technology and
    the evaluation of its possible uses in the banking sector. Despite the growing
    number of studies on blockchain technology, the literature on blockchain in banking
    is still in its infancy, with the majority of studies being conceptual. Therefore,
    this study indicates the need for further research on this topic. First, a deeper
    investigation of blockchain projects in banks would be needed to fully understand
    the implications of the technology for banking business models. For instance,
    future studies could build on the framework of the Business Model Canvas to explore
    whether blockchain projects lead to a revision of existing business models (e.g.
    by optimising existing processes to increase overall efficiency and the quality
    of products and services) or change it completely (e.g. by offering a new value
    proposition such as the development of new products and services). Moreover, with
    more projects moving from the pilot stage to the production phase, it will be
    interesting to provide empirical evidence about the true benefits that blockchain
    technology may provide for banks and their profitability. This is essential to
    understand which banking areas can benefit from the adoption of blockchain and
    to identify which (internal and external) factors can determine whether the implementation
    of the technology in banks is successful or not. In turn, this will provide important
    insights into the ways in which banks (can) tackle the challenges of blockchain
    technology.

  zh: 随着技术以加快的步伐发展，学术研究也应该对理解技术以及评估其在银行业可能应用方面做出重要贡献。 尽管有越来越多的区块链技术研究，但关于银行业的区块链文献仍处于萌芽阶段，大多数研究是概念性的。
    因此，本研究表明有必要进一步研究这个话题。 首先，需要对银行中的区块链项目进行更深入的调查，以充分理解技术对银行业务模式的影响。 例如，未来的研究可以基于商业模式画布的框架，探讨区块链项目是否会导致对现有商业模式的修订（例如，通过优化现有流程以提高整体效率和产品服务的质量），或者完全改变它（例如，通过提供新的价值主张，比如开发新产品和服务）。
    此外，随着更多项目从试点阶段转向生产阶段，提供有关区块链技术可能为银行和其盈利能力带来真正好处的经验性证据将是很有趣的。 这对于理解哪些银行领域可以从采用区块链中受益，并确定内部和外部因素（可以）确定区块链技术在银行中的实施是否成功至关重要。
    反过来，这将为理解银行（可以）如何应对区块链技术的挑战提供重要见解。
