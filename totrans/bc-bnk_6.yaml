- en: The banking industry is in the midst of major changes, and banks are facing
    several challenges. On the one hand, recent advances in technologies have had
    a significant impact on the expectations and behaviours of consumers, who are
    now demanding better-quality and more customised services and products. At the
    same time, new technologies are increasing competition in the industry, opening
    the doors to many new entrants (e.g. fintech firms and technology providers) seeking
    to offer financial services in innovative ways and provide a better user experience.
    On the other hand, new technologies are enabling banks to improve the efficiency
    of the processes underlying their offer of financial services. In this regard,
    new technologies can be instrumental in improving the quality of the services
    being offered to clients and ensure that they have a competitive edge.

    is blockchain technology—a decentralised and distributed ledger that is constantly
    updated and allows for the recording of transactions and the tracking of assets
    in a given network (Swan [2015](#CR15); Crosby et al. [2016](#CR3); Walport [2016](#CR18)).
    It started as the technology underlying Bitcoin (Nakamoto [2008](#CR9))—that is,
    first-generation blockchain (Blockchain 1.0.), which has been used to allow the
    recording of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) transactions—and has become
    a tool facilitating the process of recording any transaction type and tracking
    the movement of any asset. These uses have made it applicable to multiple areas
    in the form of second-generation blockchain (Blockchain 2.0) onwards (Ulieru [2016](#CR17);
    Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR6); Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR16)). Specifically,
    blockchain represents a break and a more efficient alternative from the centralised
    data repositories that have historically been used to support transaction processing
    (Yermack [2017](#CR19)): by combining several computer technologies, including
    distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms and
    cryptography functions, blockchain can solve the problems of traditional databases
    (i.e. centralised systems). Blockchain allows fast, low-cost and secure transactions
    without the need for third parties.'

    widely acknowledged as a disruptive force in the financial sector and a key source
    of future financial market innovation because it undermines the traditional business
    models still used in many financial service transactions. Concerning the banking
    industry, in particular, numerous studies (e.g. MacDonald et al. [2016](#CR7);
    Buitenhek [2016](#CR2); Guo and Liang [2016](#CR5); Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR12);
    Yermack [2019](#CR20); Stulz [2019](#CR14)) argue that blockchain can create new
    opportunities for banks and pose new threats to their business. In this regard,
    this study underscores the importance of differentiating between the various types
    and uses of blockchain technology.

- en: First-generation blockchain—i.e. blockchain used to launch cryptocurrencies
    (usually public blockchains)—poses a threat to banks because blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    (like Bitcoin) are tools that can be used to disintermediate banks. Specifically,
    blockchain linked to cryptocurrencies enables new players (e.g. blockchain-based
    start-ups) to enter the market and offer products and services that have traditionally
    been banking products, as well as new and innovative ones, at a lower price, thereby
    increasing competition in the banking industry. This may cause banks to lose their
    market shares and, consequently, jeopardises their profitability. Conversely,
    second-generation blockchain—i.e. the adoption of the distributed ledger technology
    (DLT) of blockchain that provides banking services (usually private blockchains
    )—gives banks an opportunity since the technology can improve the quality of the
    services they offer their clients. In particular, by automating such processes
    and eliminating the parties involved in the operations , blockchain’s DLT can
    enhance the efficiency of middle and back-office processes and, consequently,
    improve the products and services the banks offer their customers. Activities
    like lending , payments , trade finance and capital markets are the main banking
    areas that may benefit from adopting the technology, which can cut costs and increase
    transaction speeds. In addition, as discussed in Chapter [3](490216_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml),
    blockchain can allow banks to create new product and services and reach new potential
    customers (i.e. unbanked and underbanked populations), thus generating new and
    potentially important revenue streams. Through these three channels (i.e. efficiency
    improvements , product innovation and new market segments), blockchain technology
    can positively affect banks’ profitability and represent an important source of
    competitive edge.

    to cope with the challenges mentioned above. This book provides new insights on
    the developments, trends and challenges of using blockchain in the banking industry.
    More specifically, it outlines the potential impact of blockchain’s DLT on the
    traditional banking business model and the current undertaking by banks to embrace
    the technology.

- en: Building on the framework of the Business Model Canvas by Osterwalder and Pigneur
    ([2010](#CR11)), this study shows that blockchain’s potential impact on banks
    ’ business models could be broad, with all the elements of a bank’s business model
    significantly affected. As discussed in Chapter [4](490216_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    blockchain can enable banks to offer their customers a new value proposition,
    namely providing traditional products and services more efficiently and creating
    and offering new ones that are not necessarily associated with traditional banking
    products but are tailored to meet customers’ individual needs. For this reason,
    innovation will become a central element of a bank’s strategy. Moreover, the technology
    can allow banks to open new market segments, thereby reaching a multitude of new
    potential customers. This will require banks to rethink their key internal resources
    and activities, as well as their partnerships, to make the new value proposition
    possible. First, banks will need to move outside of their traditional resources
    to improve their ability to deal with and leverage the technology in order to
    foster innovative solutions. In particular, human resources capable of understanding
    the technology and translate it into costs and economy of scale (e.g. blockchain
    experts, technologists, IT experts, etc.), as well as resources that can help
    to develop and exploit the vast and diversified quantity of information recorded
    in the distributed ledger (e.g. data scientists), will be key enablers of the
    new business models. At the same time, activities like *data analytics* *, research
    & development* and *customer relationship management* will be major factors driving
    innovation in banks and, in this way, become more valuable than they ever were
    before. In this regard, collaboration with other financial institutions, technology
    firms (e.g. blockchain-based start-ups) and universities will be crucial for banks
    to acquire particular resources or perform certain activities.

    Morkunas et al. [2019](#CR8); Rajnak and Puschmann [2020](#CR13)), this study
    suggests that blockchain can change the status quo and lead to new business models
    in banking. To date, however, it has been difficult to assess how and to what
    extent blockchain can affect the traditional banking business model.

    banks investing and experimenting with the technology, recent evidence (Bank of
    Italy [2019](#CR1); EBA [2019](#CR4)) shows that most blockchain projects in banks
    are still in the development phase. Moreover, some restrictions on the widespread
    adoption of blockchain persist and have to be addressed. This relates particularly
    to the interoperability among different types of blockchains and compliance with
    existing regulatory frameworks. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that
    much has been done over the years to face such challenges. As discussed in Chapter
    [5](490216_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml), regulators and authorities around the world
    have been actively assessing compatibility with the current regulatory framework
    and identifying any regulatory “gaps” and potential risks. To this end, numerous
    initiatives, including the revision of existing rules and/or the introduction
    of new ones, have been undertaken to promote the development of the technology
    in compliance with the existing regulatory framework. At the same time, banks
    are actively collaborating with each other and with other stakeholders (governments
    , universities, etc.) to promote the development of the technology and its applications
    in financial services. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that further action is
    still needed to enable blockchain to flourish.

- en: With the technology advancing at an accelerated pace, academic research should
    also offer an important contribution to the understanding of the technology and
    the evaluation of its possible uses in the banking sector. Despite the growing
    number of studies on blockchain technology, the literature on blockchain in banking
    is still in its infancy, with the majority of studies being conceptual. Therefore,
    this study indicates the need for further research on this topic. First, a deeper
    investigation of blockchain projects in banks would be needed to fully understand
    the implications of the technology for banking business models. For instance,
    future studies could build on the framework of the Business Model Canvas to explore
    whether blockchain projects lead to a revision of existing business models (e.g.
    by optimising existing processes to increase overall efficiency and the quality
    of products and services) or change it completely (e.g. by offering a new value
    proposition such as the development of new products and services). Moreover, with
    more projects moving from the pilot stage to the production phase, it will be
    interesting to provide empirical evidence about the true benefits that blockchain
    technology may provide for banks and their profitability. This is essential to
    understand which banking areas can benefit from the adoption of blockchain and
    to identify which (internal and external) factors can determine whether the implementation
    of the technology in banks is successful or not. In turn, this will provide important
    insights into the ways in which banks (can) tackle the challenges of blockchain
    technology.
