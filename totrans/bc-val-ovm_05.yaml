    NFT representing that you voted on this item, then maybe some third-party developer
    can see that you voted on it and will want to incentivize you to do other things.
    Then your vote becomes an actual asset. It is now a digital good.

    products and services. Lapham says, “It becomes more powerful when we start thinking
    about the interactions and the bundles of actions that we can take with collections
    of NFTs. You can start to get creative with it and think of some interesting use
    cases.”

    goods, say a badge. They have value and you can exchange it for whatever. It could
    be tickets, other goods, or money. The money could be in whatever form you like—Ether,
    Bitcoin, a stable coin, fiat, or something else.

    collecting various rewards. This collection may be viewed as a form of payment.
    In other words, if you contribute to an open-source project, you get some benefits
    in return. This way I can signal my ability as a developer and improve your reputation,
    social capital, and employment opportunities. Lapham explains, “Once you start
    using blockchain to explicitly attach awards through your activity, then it becomes
    more interesting. This allows you to trade.”

    their value and uses. It increases the value of social capital or reputation.
    In the process, they can incentivize certain behaviors. Lapham observes,

    and writing actively within the thread online, then you know the person is a really
    good user. You may want to reward them to encourage further engagement. This may
    further increase incentives for people to contribute to open-source projects.

    to collaborate and monetize their skills while working on open-source projects
    through bounties. Gitcoin is on a mission to make open-source contribution sustainable
    by allowing developers to choose projects that fit their portfolio, preferences,
    and time, as well as to incentivize open-source software development in blockchain.
    As Gitcoin’s website explains, “The weight of maintaining open-source falls on
    the shoulders of 0.01 percent of developers. This is not sustainable. This is
    not right.”

    send information over a network without an intermediary. Blockchain I think does
    the exact same thing for money or for value; it allows you to send it over a network
    without an intermediary. If you think about what the Internet did to turn our
    media into entertainment, I just think that if you project that forward it’s possible
    that what Napster did to record companies, blockchain could do to financial services
    companies. It could change the way we think about work and invest in financial
    services. That’s the broad thinking about blockchain’s potential. My specific
    niche within that is thinking jobs might look like in that ecosystem.[12](14_ch05.xhtml#ch05en12)

    developers to design, test, code, and build your project teams today. It also
    allows you to crowdfund for your open-source start-up or project to increase your
    budget and bring in more developers. As a coder, you get paid in crypto for freelance
    jobs, building features and solving bug bounties. You can work with top open-source
    projects and get paid fast.

    work that they’re going to do while allowing them to test drive relationships
    before they decide to go full time and before they decide to get hitched. By doing
    a bounty with the counterparty, you’re really able to try before you buy. And
    I think that’s an important component of the ecosystem that we’re building.[13](14_ch05.xhtml#ch05en13)

- en: The introduction of the Internet has changed the world in many ways, but perhaps
    its greatest impact has been in fostering collaboration across boundaries previously
    thought insurmountable. We can now connect not just potential collaborators on
    another continent but also connect with amateurs or hobbyists who are sitting
    on creative, unusual solutions. Blockchain promises to take this radical networking
    to the next level. By enhancing the power of open source, it will change the way
    we think about exchange, cooperation, and connection
