    cryptocurrency, smart contracts, distributed ledger-based DAPPs, ICOs, and tokens.
    We’ve also explored how crypto exchanges support direct trading between major
    cryptocurrencies and fiat money, as well as trading among and between different
    cryptocurrencies. And we’ve reviewed how ICOs have established themselves as a
    powerful new way of raising capital in crypto world.

    market.” And when an ICO is listed in a crypto exchange, it also has to confront
    investors from the secondary market. The secondary market is kind of similar to
    the stock market. But because cryptocurrency is still young, when it comes to
    secondary market influence, we are seeing phenomena that can be quite unusual.

- en: There is imbalance between the prime market and secondary market. That’s the
    first thing to understand. The prime market has become standardized and has been
    so ever since traditional VC came onto the ICO evaluation scene. Many quality
    ICOs have been received well in the prime market. However, these same ICOs often
    get the cold shoulder when they’re listed on the secondary market. There are many
    reasons for this.

- en: Liquidity reveals how strong a project is in terms of potential cash-out. In
    a market where there are fewer buyers than sellers, sellers will lower their trading
    price to attract buyers. In the crypto world, this decreases the value of tokens.
    The twenty-four-hour trading cycle of the prime market is frenetic and crazy,
    but the secondary market remains extremely inactive. There are hundreds of tokens
    being traded in the secondary market, true, but investors do not see any liquidity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason behind this mainly arises from people trying to make quick money
    in the secondary market. When ICOs reach the secondary market, the prices are
    much higher than they were in the prime market. Accordingly, shareholders of an
    ICO often try to cash out before the prices go down in the secondary market. However,
    prime market investors making fast money and cashing out leaves a mess for the
    individual investors in the secondary market who have purchased the tokens at
    the peak of their price. An ICO is like a stock that needs constant buying and
    selling to maintain its liquidity and value. When early investors in the ICO cash
    out their shares, it makes it very challenging to maintain stability.

    Once it is listed in the market, the startup may find it is not able to keep up
    with innovations it promised to deliver on paper. What then makes such a situation
    even worse is when the shareholders try to cash out, which in turn drives the
    anxiety level of the whole market up. True, some strong projects do continuously
    improve their service and technology and see their quarterly net profits reliably
    increasing. However, we cannot assume that this will always, or even typically,
    be the case.

- en: The design of the early token economy is certainly not perfect. In a traditional
    financial market, before a company launches an IPO, the CEO and management team
    design a thoughtful plan detailing how shares will be offered, and price of shares,
    in a way that ensures the liquidity of the stock after the IPO is launched. But
    many blockchain projects launch an ICO without sufficient experience (or any experience).
    This lack of experience usually reveals itself when the secondary market comes
    in to play. Currently, there are just not enough competent financial teams available
    to help startups to properly analyze all pertinent aspects of their offerings.
    As a consequence, many companies overoffer shares to investors when conducting
    the ICO launch. For example, many only reserve 10 percent of issued tokens, meaning
    90 percent of tokens will go flooding into the market, which makes it possible
    for speculators to manipulate the prices. Once a bad actor controls over 50 pecent
    of the tokens of one ICO, the team on the project will have no control over the
    tokens or the prices of the tokens in the secondary market. This kind of situation
    happened a lot in the early days of the cryptocurrency market. Many investors
    took advantage of insider information to make a quick buck off of people in the
    secondary market. While the overall situation has improved, the lack of strong
    regulation still hurts liquidity in the secondary market (as well as some investors
    in the prime market). Yet, so far, the majority of ICOs are still using the utility
    token format. They are not traded in markets where security regulations are fully
    developed. The role the SEC is playing—or hints that it may play—is increasingly
    critical. Total transparency would greatly increase market liquidity. As it stands,
    the violent up and down of token values in the secondary market remains a major
    issue. (Just look at the market prices at which Bitcoins are valued in different
    countries.)

    than schemes—a way for a few people to cash in. Yet he believes when regulation
    is in place, the market value will return to a reasonable level, these schemes
    will go away, and all good actors will benefit over time. Long-term investment
    will become the rule and not the exception. Consider that in the prime market
    of an ICO, it usually takes six months to a year to turn capital into profits.
    Whereas, in traditional VC, as I noted earlier, it usually takes ten years.

    the token economy is nonetheless constantly evolving on its own. By learning from
    the past, new ICOs will improve by offering fewer shares so as to have better
    control of the project and the market prices of issued tokens. In this connection,
    many investment institutes are already playing important roles in stabilizing
    the secondary market and increasing confidence in investors.

    market makers to increase liquidity, and also to support the price of the stock.
    Market makers enable the smooth flow of financial markets. The SEC defines a “market

    of their tokens in the first three months of the ICO. Since the end of 2017, there
    has been a flood of market makers coming into the ICO scene. This is because the
    secondary market for cryptocurrency is similar to the traditional financial market
    in terms of operation. Market makers coming into the cryptocurrency space serve
    the same purpose as when they’re working in the traditional stock market. But
    because of the absence of regulation, market makers in the crypto secondary market
    are not required to be licensed. Some are still very professional and helpful.
    But, of course, some are not. Many market makers do little to help increase market
    liquidity and facilitate trades. Instead, they are only facilitating arbitrage.
    Accordingly, anyone working in this space should be very careful when dealing
    with them.

    that were faced by American stock exchanges 100 years ago. When a market lacks
    certain regulations and oversights, predictable things happen. Pump and dumps
    are very common in the secondary market of cryptocurrency, just as they were on
    the US stock exchange so many years ago. Fraudsters spreading false news about
    new cryptos in a chat room have a great deal in common with con artists who sent
    false telegrams with information that might impact a stock in 1919.

    will always have an innate uniqueness. This won’t change even when it becomes
    more regulated. Stock markets are usually open between 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
    weekdays, meaning trades only happen during this specific time frame. It allows
    for high-volume trading and high liquidity, but you can’t trade on weekends or
    at midnight. In contrast, the secondary market of cryptocurrency will always be
    open twenty-four hours a day.

- en: We’ve discusses the importance of liquidity and investor confidence in the secondary
    market. Now I’d like to discuss OTC (Over The Counter) trading, and its importance
    for the top 1 percent of investors and traders in cryptocurrency world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OTC is a relatively simple concept. An OTC trade is done directly between two
    parties without the supervision or facilitation of an exchange, but buyers and
    sellers still need to find each other to close that trade. In the world of cryptocurrency,
    OTC is mostly used for fiat-to-cryptocurrencies trades. (Exchange trading is mostly
    comprised of trades among different tokens and cryptocurrencies.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why does OTC exist in the first place? Well, the financial market is a bit like
    a domino. When you push one down, it will trigger a chain reaction. In an exchange
    where information is transparent, a very large movement of cash will trigger sudden
    price movements in the market—which has the potential to impact the person or
    group of people behind the trade. Many would prefer to go the OTC route and keep
    things quiet.
  prefs: []

- en: OTC traders dealing in amounts over $250,000 are often called “whales.” Other
    customers are often called “small fish.” People on exchanges such as Huobi and
    Binance are often individual traders. This is the visible market that the majority
    of crypto players are most familiar with. But the liquidity of the visual market
    is restricted by the number of individuals participating at any moment. It’s also
    restricted by which currencies carry which liquidity. Exchanges are like retail
    shops on the street, open to everyone. When a whale shows up in the market to
    purchase a large amount of cryptocurrencies, the whole market goes up. This is
    usually referred to as “slippage.” For big players, OTC is the preferred option
    precisely because it’s not supposed to generate a sudden market up or down. OTC
    traders can be private traders, brokers, or institutions. Their major function
    is to provide security during the buy to avoid turbulence on transparent exchanges.
    The crypto exchange Altonomy serves as an OTC provider and puts its own funds
    into the platform to secure the liquidity of OTC trades. Increasing liquidity
    means maintaining a relatively stable and reasonable price for buyers and sellers.
    Once the price is set, Altonomy will offset the risk in the market. Meanwhile,
    a price for the trade will be decided. For example, if a buyer is considering
    purchasing a certain amount of Ethereum, Altonomy will generate a relatively low
    price that will also have a low influence on the market.

- en: Despite the secretive nature of specific trades, OTC trading has a profound
    influence over the cryptocurrency market. The liquidity of exchanges is only going
    to go up as more and more individuals come into the game. OTC also provides a
    strong support function exterior to the traditional exchanges. For example, the
    price of Bitcoin and Ethereum is largely dependent on its prices in OTC trading.
    The volume of OTC trading also reflects the market liquidity and market cap. OTC
    also influences the confidence of future cryptocurrency trades. The more trades
    made through OTC, the more confidence is injected into the market. If the amount
    of cash being invested into the market decreases, so will the confidence in cryptocurrency.
    According to an OTC trading desk (with whom, full disclosure, my company has a
    collaboration), the cash flowing into the crypto market in January of 2018 was
    only two-thirds of what it was in 2017\. As a result, the whole market was suffering
    from poor liquidity, and fewer trades were made during this period.

    capital, family office trading, and hedge funds. But due to a lack of regulation,
    many pension funds, banks, and wealth management companies stay out of the market
    entirely. However, there’s a major OTC desk called Circle, where you’ll find very
    high-profile investors such as Goldman Sachs, DRW, Genesis, Smart Contract, and
    Octagon Strategy. According to Reuters, Circle’s daily volume of digital assets
    trades was between $1.5 billion and $2 billion during December of 2017 alone.
    In addition, I should note that Skype and Google Voice are places where OTC trades
    can also take place.

    of institutional investors. So far, the SEC and CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission) have shown themselves to be very fond of derivatives. Yet limited
    tradable cryptocurrencies are not giving a lot of incentive for old money to come
    into the market. In July of 2018, a Chicago-based exchange handed in an application
    for a Bitcoin ETF to the SEC. Previously, Gemini and Winklevoss had tried to apply
    for an ETF with the SEC. (We’ll have to wait and see if this one takes.) Having
    more financial derivatives available will increase liquidity in the secondary
    market. According to a Reuters report from March of 2018, the British exchange
    house Coinfloor will soon begin selling Bitcoin futures. Their product targets
    hedge funds, sophisticated individual traders, and Bitcoin miners.
