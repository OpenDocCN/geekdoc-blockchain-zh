- en: Mobile devices and applications are prone to different kinds of cyber threats
    and attacks that affect their users’ privacy. Therefore, there is critical need
    to understand all cyber threats characteristics in order to prevent their risks.
    However, most of cyber threats classifications are usually limited and based on
    one or two criteria in the classification process of threats. In addition, the
    current frameworks did not present an exhaustive list of cyber threats on mobile
    devices and applications. According to above reasons, this study proposes an exhaustive
    framework for mobile devices and applications-cyber security threat classifications,
    which includes most cyber threats classification and principles. The main purpose
    of our framework is to systematically identify cyber security threats, show their
    potential impacts, draw the mobile users’ attention to those threats, and enable
    them to take protective actions as appropriate.

    life activities such as online shopping, bank transactions, etc. This huge increase
    in the use of mobile applications has resulted in a large rising in cyber security
    attacks [[7](#CR7), [8](#CR8), [10](#CR10)]. Security problems in mobile applications
    are still a serious concern for many researchers due to the lack security of mobile
    devices [[12](#CR12), [34](#CR34), [45](#CR45)]. This makes cyber attackers exploit
    these vulnerabilities to access the systems illegally [[26](#CR26)]. Mobile devices
    have several limitations in terms of lower power, computational processing and
    limited resources [[36](#CR36)]. Mobile devices have many security vulnerabilities
    that can put users and organizations at high risk [[59](#CR59)]. Mobile users
    face several types of security risks such as loss of data, invasion of privacy
    and financial losses. These risks are happened when malicious attacks exploit
    vulnerabilities in the operating systems of mobile devices. Mobile devices include
    many applications, which collect data according to their assigned task and share
    it with other applications. This interconnection of these devices in a heterogeneous
    environment makes them more vulnerable to the cyber security issues and threats.
    Therefore, cyber-attacks have become a serious concern, and this led to offer
    many security solutions from research community [[60](#CR60)].

    tools and guidelines that employed to protect the applications and devices over
    the internet [[18](#CR18)]. Cyber security now is one of the most important issues
    for users and organizations, through protecting their assets and securing their
    information through detecting and mitigating the various cyber threats and attacks
    [[19](#CR19)]. Despite many researchers have presented many countermeasures to
    address various types of security issues and problems in mobile application platforms,
    but are still not sufficient to protect the mobile applications from the ever-increasing
    security vulnerabilities and attacks. Thus, protecting mobile applications from
    cyber-attacks and threats has become one of the important role that has been motivating
    many researchers to conduct more research in the recent years [[3](#CR3), [4](#CR4),
    [6](#CR6), [9](#CR9), [20](#CR20)].

    the critical challenging that ensure the security and privacy of mobile users.
    Security countermeasures should protect the data, information, hardware and applications
    in all stages. La Polla et al. [[31](#CR31)], determined three main security problems
    of mobile platforms domain including data confidentiality, privacy and trust.

- en: Data confidentiality is considered one of the fundamentals problem in mobile
    devices and applications [[51](#CR51)]. In mobile platforms context, if the user
    need to access data should take authorization first in order to prevent attackers
    to access sensitive data stored on the mobile devices. To achieve that, there
    is needed to focus on two important aspects are (1) authorization and access control
    and (2) identity authentication. Mobile devices and applications need to be able
    to verify the user or device identity is authorized to access the data or not.
    Where an authorization mechanism helps mobile devices and application to identify
    if the mobile users or devices are permitted to access data or service. Access
    control mechanism also ensures of preventing attackers from access to resources
    of the system. This will establish a secure connection between mobile devices
    and thus, transition of data between users in a safety way. Another important
    issue that should be consider in mobile devices and applications is identity authentication.
    In fact, this issue is very critical in mobile environment, because huge number
    of users and devices need to authenticate each other through trustable way in
    a secure manner.

    are connected, and sensitive data is shared and exchanged over the internet, this
    make user privacy a sensitive topic in mobile domain. Protecting the privacy of
    users data in mobile devices from cyber attacks is still a hot topic for many
    researchers and need to address [[2](#CR2), [29](#CR29), [63](#CR63)].

    process was conducted based on existing guidelines established by Kitchenham and
    Charters [[30](#CR30)] which includes (1) identifying the inclusion and exclusion
    criteria (2) determining the data sources and search strategies and (3) data analysis
    and coding. This review is considered an essential step before conducting any
    research paper, and it helps to establish the foundation for knowledge accumulation.
    It also helps to identify the areas that previous studies have missed. The following
    subsections describe in detail the steps used for conducting the systematic review

- en: 'Cyber security threat is defined as any action that takes advantage of security
    weaknesses in a system and has a negative impact on it [[16](#CR16)]. As mobile
    devices and applications become a reality, a growing number of ubiquitous mobile
    devices have raised the number of the cyber security threats. Unfortunately, mobile
    devices come with new set of cyber security threats. There is a growing awareness
    that the new generations of mobile devices could be targeted with malware and
    vulnerable to attack. In the literature, there are several studies classified
    the cyber security threats based on attack techniques used by attackers to exploit
    vulnerabilities [[42](#CR42), [43](#CR43), [50](#CR50)]. For example, Tomić and
    McCann [[54](#CR54)], categorized the security threats into three levels are:
    data security level (anonymity and freshness), access security level (accessibility,
    authorization and authentication) and network security level. The researchers
    in the same study also mentioned that attacks could occur in all layers from application
    layer to physical layer. For example, at the application layer level, a malicious
    attack can be added along the communication link to generate fake messages and
    data in order to attack the ongoing communication and increase the data collision.
    The attack in transport layer happen through sending unlimited connection request
    in order to minimize the node’s energy and exhaust its resources and this lead
    to denial of service. Other attack can be occurred in a network layer in several
    forms such as spoofing, sinkhole, flooding and replay attack in order to create
    and send fake messages or causing congestion in the network. Jamming attack at
    the Data link layer can cause loss of signals and data and destroy the channel
    and increased interference. At the physical layer level, the attacker can allow
    unauthorized nodes to access to the network and damage it. Jouini et al. [[42](#CR42)]
    conducted a literature review to classify the security threats in information
    systems. They established a hybrid model for classifying the security threats
    for information systems. They classified the security threats into three types:
    human threats, technological threats and environmental threats. Otuoze et al.
    [[43](#CR43)] proposed a framework for the security threats of smart grid based
    on threats sources. Where, in the framework, the researchers’ classified the security
    threats into technical and non-technical resource threats. Technical threats was
    categorized into three types of threats are infrastructure threats, technical
    operational threats and system data management threats. While non-technical threats
    were classified into environmental threats and governmental threats. Singh and
    Shrivastava [[52](#CR52)] categorized the security attacks and threats on cloud
    computing into four levels: authentication Attacks, side Channel Attacks, cloud
    Malware injection attack and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Roman, Lopez, and
    Mambo [[47](#CR47)] classified the security threats of mobile edge computing five
    assets are: (1) Network infrastructure threats such as man in the middle and denial
    of service attack, (2) Edge data center threats such as physical damage, privacy
    leakage, privilege escalation and service manipulation, (3) Virtualization infrastructure
    threats such as denial of service, misuse of resources, privacy leakage and privilege
    escalation, (4) core infrastructures threats such as privacy leakage, service
    manipulation, rogue infrastructure and (5) User devices such as injection of information
    and service manipulation. Abraham and Chengalur Smith [[1](#CR1)] confirmed social
    engineering malware proliferation through a variety of infiltration channels such
    as e-mail, social software, websites, and portable media. Mosakheil [[40](#CR40)]
    in his research divided the security threats for blockchain technology into five
    categories are: (1) Double spending threats, (2) Mining/Pool threats, (3) Wallet
    threats, (4) Network threats such as DDoS attack, and (5) Smart contracts threats.
    In the same way, Homayun et al. [[26](#CR26)] classified the common cyber security
    threats by using mapping study, which include phishing, denial of service (DoS),
    injection attack, man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, SQL injection
    attack and malware (Table [3](#Tab3)).Table 3'

- en: 'Cyber security attack is defined as any activities taken to harm a system or
    disrupt normal operations through exploiting vulnerabilities using various techniques
    and tools. Attackers launch attacks to achieve goals either for personal satisfaction
    or recompense. Cyber attack takes several forms, including (1) passive attack
    to monitor unprotected network communications in order to decrypt weakly encrypted
    traffic and getting authentication information; close-in attacks; exploitation
    by insiders, and so on, and (2) active attack aims to monitor unencrypted traffic
    to capture sensitive information. In this section, we attempted to review the
    classifications of cyber security attacks based on the type of behavior used by
    the attacker. According to the literature, the common cyber security attacks classifications
    including: (1) Access attacks which allow unauthorized users access to the network
    or devices such as smart phones with have no right to access [[2](#CR2), [15](#CR15),
    [23](#CR23), [46](#CR46)]. Table [4](#Tab4) summarizes the cyber security attacks
    classifications, (2) Reconnaissance attack allow attacker to capturing, discovering
    and mapping of system vulnerabilities such as scanning traffic network, network
    ports and IP address information [[2](#CR2), [5](#CR5), [17](#CR17), [49](#CR49)].
    (3) Physical attack this type of attack aims to tamper hardware devices, for example
    some technologies such as IOT devices operate in outdoor environments may highly
    susceptible to physical attacks [[23](#CR23), [25](#CR25), [32](#CR32), [55](#CR55)].
    (4) Denial-of-service (DoS) attack allow the attacker to make the network or device
    services unavailable to its intended users due to several reasons such as limited
    computation resources and low memory capabilities. This make mobile platforms
    are vulnerable to DOS attack [[22](#CR22), [41](#CR41), [44](#CR44), [48](#CR48)].
    (6) Password-based attack can be done by attackers in two ways: (1) brute force
    attack by using cracking tools to guess the correct password in order to access
    valid password, (2) dictionary attack depends on trying several letters and numbers
    to guess user passwords [[53](#CR53), [62](#CR62)]. (7) Supervisory Control and
    Data Acquisition attack using malware such as Trojan to take control of the system.
    Mobile applications are vulnerable to many cyber-attacks like Trojan virus [[2](#CR2)].
    (8) Spoofing attack is based on obtaining the IP address of the devices to attack
    the users through enabling attackers to access users’ confidential data and use
    it for malicious purposes [[28](#CR28), [33](#CR33), [38](#CR38), [39](#CR39),
    [58](#CR58)]. (9) Botnet attack is based on a collection of Internet-connected
    devices that have been breached and ceded to a malicious device known as botnet
    controller. The botnet controller able to direct malicious activities in order
    to damage the network or exploit users and data for materialistic gain [[13](#CR13),
    [14](#CR14), [39](#CR39)]. (10) Sybil attack is a threat in which attacker attempt
    to obtain identity of honest user and pretend as a distinct user and then attempt

- en: In fact, mobile devices and applications are prone to different kinds of cyber
    threats and attacks that affect their users’ privacy and there is critical need
    to understand all cyber threats characteristics in order to prevent their risks.
    However, most of cyber threats classifications are usually limited and based on
    one or two criteria in the classification process of threats. In addition, the
    current frameworks did not present an exhaustive list of cyber threats on mobile
    devices and applications. These frameworks may be suitable for stable technologies,
    but in the constantly changing technologies like mobile technology and IOT, it
    is very different and need to protect against cyber threats continuously [[64](#CR64)].

- en: Classification process of cyber threats is an important step that allows users,
    organizations and governments to know threats that influence their sensitive information
    and hence protect their devices and systems in advance. In addition, this step
    helps companies to develop their mobile applications with less vulnerabilities
    [[35](#CR35)]. These threats can be identified through understanding the behavior
    of existing threats work. Unfortunately, existing classifications do not present
    an exhaustive list of cyber threats on mobile devices and applications and do
    not support the classification principles [[35](#CR35), [56](#CR56), [61](#CR61)].
    At that point, the optimal solution is to propose a hybrid model to combine all
    different classifications of threats.

    researchers due to the lack security of mobile devices. This makes cyber attackers
    exploit these vulnerabilities to access the systems illegally. This research aimed
    to better understanding of the nature of cyber threats in order to establish appropriate
    countermeasures to prevent or mitigate their effects. We proposed an exhaustive
    framework for mobile devices and applications-cyber security threat classifications,
    which includes most cyber threats classification and principles. Our framework
    is flexible, dynamic and multidimensional and covers most cyber threats on mobile
    devices and applications.
