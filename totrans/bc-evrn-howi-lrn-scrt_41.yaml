    from pillaging our gold supply?” Evan began riffing. “When the dollar was backed
    by gold, you could trade a million dollars for a million dollars’ worth of gold.
    Other countries would just load up on dollars, then buy out our gold supply.”

    gold reserves, so every “Goldbuck” is redeemable for one ounce of gold. The other
    government has no gold and just prints “Airbucks” whenever it wants.

    have a fixed supply programmed into their code. There are twenty-one million bitcoin,
    and there won’t be any more. Period.

    AirCoins out of one hundred total, or 10 percent of the AirCoin supply. The team
    behind AirCoin needs to raise money, so they create an additional nine hundred
    tokens and sell them at the going rate (which goes down as they sell them).

    printing money with nothing to back it up. There’s no real value behind it except
    our collective belief that the new money is as good as the old money.

- en: “But aren’t all tokens created out of thin air?” a skeptic will ask. At first,
    yes. But once the value of that economy is established, any unexpected new tokens
    will “water down” the value of all tokens. It is for this reason that the rules
    of the economy—the “tokenomics”—are so important.
  prefs: []

    If your kids are going into college, tell them to dual-major in economics and
    computer science. In the years to come, tokenomists are going to pull down some
    serious coin.
