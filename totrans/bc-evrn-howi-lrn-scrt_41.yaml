    gold reserves, so every “Goldbuck” is redeemable for one ounce of gold. The other

    AirCoins out of one hundred total, or 10 percent of the AirCoin supply. The team
    behind AirCoin needs to raise money, so they create an additional nine hundred
    tokens and sell them at the going rate (which goes down as they sell them).

- en: “But aren’t all tokens created out of thin air?” a skeptic will ask. At first,
    yes. But once the value of that economy is established, any unexpected new tokens
    will “water down” the value of all tokens. It is for this reason that the rules
    of the economy—the “tokenomics”—are so important.

  zh: 一个怀疑论者会问：“但所有的代币不是都是凭空创造出来的吗？”一开始，是的。但是一旦经济的价值得到确立，任何意外的新代币都会“稀释”所有代币的价值。这就是代币经济学（tokenomics）的规则非常重要的原因。
- en: Tokenomics is an uncharted discipline, and there are very few best practices.
    If your kids are going into college, tell them to dual-major in economics and
    computer science. In the years to come, tokenomists are going to pull down some
    serious coin.
