    that all other blockchains are compared to and the framework that nearly all have
    drawn upon. Knowing the basics of how the Bitcoin blockchain operates will allow

    operates. I offer safety tips that will make your Bitcoin experience smoother
    and more successful. I also show you practical things you can start doing now
    with Bitcoin. In these pages, you find out how to mine the Bitcoin token, giving
    you a new way to get your hands on Bitcoins without buying them. Finally, you
    discover how to transfer your tokens to paper wallets, and other practical ways
    to keep your tokens safe online.  ## Getting a Brief History of the Bitcoin Blockchain'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bitcoin and the concept of its blockchain were first introduced in the fall
    of 2008 as a whitepaper and later released as open-source software in 2009\. (You
    can read the Bitcoin whitepaper at [`www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf`](http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The author who first introduced Bitcoin in that 2008 whitepaper is an anonymous
    programmer or cohort working under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto collaborated
    with many other open-source developers on Bitcoin until 2010\. This individual
    or group has since stopped its involvement in the project and transferred control
    to prominent Bitcoin core developers. There have been many claims and theories
    concerning the identity of Nakamoto, but none of them have been confirmed as of
    this writing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless, what Nakamoto created is an extraordinary peer-to-peer payment system
    that enables users to send Bitcoin, the value transfer token, directly and without
    an intermediary to hold the two parties accountable. The network itself acts as
    the intermediary by verifying the transactions and assuring that no one tries
    to cheat the system by spending Bitcoins twice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Nakamoto’s goal was to close the large hole in digital trust, and the concept
    of the blockchain was his answer. It solves the Byzantine general’s problem, which
    is the ultimate human problem, especially online: How do you trust the information
    you are given and the people who are giving you that information, when self-interest,
    malicious third parties, and the like can deceive you? Many Bitcoin enthusiasts
    feel that blockchain technology is the missing piece that will allow societies
    to operate entirely online because it reframes trust by recording relevant information
    in a public space that cannot be removed and can always be referenced making deception
    more difficult.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchains mix many old technologies that society has been using for thousands
    of years in new ways. For example, cryptography and payment are merged to create
    cryptocurrency. *Cryptography* is the art of secure communication under the eye
    of third parties. Payment through a token that represents values is also something
    humans have been doing for a very long time, but when merged, it creates cryptocurrencies
    and becomes something entirely new. Cryptocurrency lets you take the concept of
    money and move it online with the ability to trade value securely through a token.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchains also incorporate *hashing* (transforming data of any size into short,
    fixed-length values). Hashing also incorporates another old technology called
    Merkle trees, which take many hashes and squeeze them down to one hash, while
    still being able to prove each piece of data that was individually hashed (see
    [Figure 4-1](#c04-fig-0001)).

    quickly, the creators realized that it had a much larger potential. With that
    in mind, they architected the blockchain of Bitcoin to be able to record more
    than the data concerning the movement of the token. The Bitcoin blockchain is
    the oldest, and one of the largest, blockchains in the world. It’s composed of
    thousands of nodes that are running the Bitcoin protocol. The protocol is creating
    and securing the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a public ledger of all transactions in the Bitcoin network, and the *nodes* are
    computers that are recording entries into that ledger. The *Bitcoin protocol*

    are created as a reward for processing transactions and recording them inside
    the blockchain. Nodes also earn a small fee for confirming transactions.

- en: Anyone can run the Bitcoin protocol and mine the token. It’s an open-source
    project that thrives as more individuals participate in the network. The fewer
    people who participate, the more centralized it becomes — and centralization weakens
    the system. The primary thing that makes Bitcoin a secure system is the large
    number of independent nodes that are globally distributed.

    Early in its history, you could run the Bitcoin protocol and earn Bitcoins on
    a desktop computer. Now, in order to have any hope of ever receiving Bitcoins,
    you need to purchase expensive specialized equipment or use a cloud service.

- en: In order to create a message in the Bitcoin blockchain, you have to send some
    Bitcoin from one account to another. When you send a transaction in Bitcoin, the
    message is broadcast across the whole network. After the message is sent, it’s
    impossible to alter it because the message is recorded inside the Bitcoin blockchain.
    This feature makes it imperative that you always choose your message wisely and
    never broadcast sensitive information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the token’s ledger can add up in a hurry. So, Bitcoin requires that you keep
    your communications very short. The current limit is just 40 characters.

    use Bitcoin have been hacked. And wallets and Bitcoin exchanges are often hacked
    due to inadequate security. The Bitcoin community has fought back by developing
    elegant solutions to keep their coins safe, including wallet encryption, multiple

    a few.'

    2140\. No one can predict what will happen at that point, but miners will always
    earn some profit from transaction fees. Plus, users of the blockchain and the
    Bitcoins themselves will be incentivized to protect the network, because if mining
    stops, Bitcoins become vulnerable and so does the data that has been locked into
    the blockchain.'

    of Ireland. The payoff of this sort of attack is also extremely limited. It would
    only allow the attacker to roll back his own transaction. He couldn’t take anybody
    else’s Bitcoins or fake transactions or coins.'
