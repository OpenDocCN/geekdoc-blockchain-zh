- en: If 2017 is remembered as the Year of the ICO, then I think history will look
    back on 2018 as the Year of ICO Regulation. The cryptocurrency market cap has
    been rising since the beginning of 2017\. The steadily increasing number of ICOs
    is forcing regulators to take second and third looks at the regulation of the
    crypto market. Many entities in the US are now actively involved in formulating
    suitable regulations for the crypto economy.

- en: After a year of soaring Bitcoin prices, people everywhere began to realize the
    money-making potential in this market. About 30,000 cryptocurrency-related domain
    names were registered in 2017 around the peak of Bitcoin’s price. Many of these
    domains, however, appeared to be tied to scams or tricks. In addition to fake
    addresses, false marketing materials, and promises of over 4 percent daily interest,
    some of these unsavory sites even used unauthorized photos of high-profile individuals
    and celebrities to entice investors. Lack of regulation gives speculators a chance
    to take advantage of ICOs and of the less-regulated crypto market as a whole.

    State of Texas was one of the first to bring the hammer down on these ICO schemes.
    In May of 2018, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) shut down the cryptocurrency
    promoters Bitcoin Trading & Cloud Mining and Forex EA&Bitcoin Investment LLC.

    Wind Wide Coin. The company’s website displayed fake endorsements from Jennifer
    Aniston, Prince Charles, and former Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen to deceive
    investors. Not only was this business using unauthorized photos of celebrities,
    Wind Wide Coin was not even registered as a business with the government.

    uncovering a virtual playbook of tactics employed by promoters of illegal and
    fraudulent cryptocurrency investment programs. Although their names may change
    and their products may vary, these promoters are employing surprisingly similar
    schemes. They are often promising lucrative returns from sophisticated investments
    tied to cryptocurrencies, and then manipulating photographs, media, testimonials
    and other online information to deceive the public into believing their claims.

    Mining Pool (PMP), a European-based cryptocurrency business. It has also been
    permanently banned from conducting business in North Carolina. In Alabama, state
    government came down on the crypto mining companies LEV, Platinum, and Extabit
    and banned them from making sales. Colorado’s state government investigated two
    ICO companies based in the state, and Massachusetts has permanently banned five
    ICOs.

    But sometimes, even experienced investors may find it hard to keep up with the
    scammers and their tricks. As the ICO market grows, more scammers are trying their
    best to deceive investors. The problem is real, and it is serious. According to
    Coindesk, the Federal Trade Commission believes that American consumers lost $532
    million to cryptocurrency-related scams in the first two months of 2018\. That’s
    staggering. Furthermore, that number could potentially grow to $3 billion by the
    end of 2018\. Investors may lack knowledge and education regarding the crypto
    market, but a lack of swift action from enforcement agencies doesn’t improve the
    situation (and only encourages the criminals).

    In the last chapter, we reviewed what enforcement agencies in different countries
    around the world have decided to do. In the United States, the jury is still out.
    Regulators are playing it conservative. They are holding back. They haven’t said
    “No” but they haven’t said “Yes,” either.

    preemptive power to regulate blockchain. Instead, it has decided to leave the
    issue to state governments. According to Business Insider, in June of 2015, the
    State of New York became the first state to regulate cryptocurrency. By 2017,
    at least eight more states had laws on the books.

    on Blockchain and Digital Currency, Arizona is one of the most forward-thinking
    states when it comes to embracing the adoption of blockchain. The Arizona state
    government has passed several rulings that are actually in favor of blockchain.
    For example, HB 2417 makes signatures, electronic transactions, and contracts
    on blockchain legally valid. And SB 1091, a bill still under consideration, would
    allow residents to pay tax in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

    attitude toward blockchain. The New York Department of Financial Service (NYDFS)
    established a regulatory framework that any virtual currency businesses is required
    to abide by—the famous BitLicense (or 23 NYCRR 200). This is a license that every
    company or individual is required to obtain if they plan to do crypto-related
    business in New York. As if this weren’t enough, the process of getting the license
    takes a long time, and many who apply are not accepted. So far, New York has only
    offered the license to Circle, Ripple, Coinbase, bitFlyer, Genesis, and Xapo—that’s
    six companies total. Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs who are considering
    diving into the cryptocurrency market would be required to obtain the BitLicense,
    as well.

    of years has finally put it on the radar of the Internal Revenue Service. If you
    look at the IRS’s virtual currency guidance posted on its website, you’ll get
    a real sense of this entity’s attitude about crypto. It isn’t pretty. Virtual
    currency transactions are taxable by law just like financial transactions involving
    anything else, but back in November of 2016, the IRS asked Coinbase, one of the
    largest crypto exchanges, to hand over the financial data of 13,000 customers.
    Early in 2018, Coinbase finally complied with a court order and fulfilled the
    IRS request. The stated purpose of the request was to seek out those who were
    intentionally evading cryptocurrency taxes. However, I think it was also the IRS
    sending a signal that they were through pussyfooting around.

    Commission (SEC) are also major forces in the regulation of virtual currencies.
    Most cryptocurrencies have qualities and traits that ought to make them fall under
    the regulatory provenance of the SEC. But according to Federal Reserve Chairman
    Jerome Powell, the cryptocurrency market is not yet big enough to pose a threat,
    and the US central bank is not looking to regulate it. The Fed, it should be noted,
    does not have jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. Federal agencies such as the
    SEC already oversee many crypto-related businesses, products, and trades. The
    CFTC has categorized Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies as a commodity. This
    has led many to believe that the CFTC ultimately has a favorable and sympathetic
    attitude regarding cryptos. Moreover, Gary Gensler, chair of the CFTC, has stated,
    “there’s really nothing behind gold either … what’s behind it is a cultural norm.
    For thousands of years we liked gold. We use it as a store of value, so Bitcoin
    is a modern form of digital gold. It’s a social construct.”

    exchanges to the digital asset storage companies known as wallets. The regulatory
    position of the SEC is not to ban every single ICO, but to regulate them and make
    them better serve investors (as well as the financial industry as a whole).

    for all market participants. The US financial markets are some of the healthiest
    and most vibrant markets in the world because they have regulatory oversight and
    rules in place. As a result, Gemini is a New York trust company regulated by the
    New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which we believe makes
    it the most regulated digital asset exchange and custodian in the world.

    determined that Bitcoin is a commodity, similar to gold. As a result, Bitcoin
    is what many call a virtual commodity, and similar laws that apply to gold in
    the US apply to Bitcoin. ICOs that are securities need to register with the SEC
    and follow securities laws like any other non-cryptocurrency security in the United
    States. The US has over 80 years of laws and regulations in place for securities,
    so issuer requirements are well understood for those issuing ICOs that qualify
    as securities under the Howe Test.
