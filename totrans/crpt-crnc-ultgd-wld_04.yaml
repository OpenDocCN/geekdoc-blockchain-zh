- en: Just like with any traditional currency, you can use cryptocurrency to make
    purchases both in the store and online. You can also use them as investment tools
    or as a means of trading or bartering. While digital currency doesn't necessarily
    have a face value as in a physical instrument, you can hold it in your hand and
    carry it from one place to the next via your "wallet." In essence, your wallet
    holds the lines of code that connects you to your currency maintained in the database.
    Once all the conditions of a transaction are met, the currency can be transferred
    to the individual or organization for completion.

- en: While this explanation may sound a little complicated, there is really very
    little difference between conducting a transaction in a traditional bank and trading
    in cryptocurrency. When you put your money into a bank account, there are certain
    conditions that you must meet to reclaim it. You may be asked to provide identification,
    a history of past transactions, or give a signature that matches one they have
    on file.

    on file before you can make any changes to your account. With cryptocurrency,
    however, you eliminate the middleman, and through the use of a code, you are the
    party responsible for ensuring that all the conditions are met before deciding
    to transfer the funds.

- en: Encryption is simply the tool used to convert the data relating to the transaction
    into a line of code. This is done to keep all but the interested parties from
    accessing the information. Just as you have passwords and key codes to get information
    on your bank account online, your digital currency will do the same but in a little
    more detail. The user will create two keys that are linked to each other by a
    mathematical equation. The public key is used to create the code, which is called
    the encryption and the second key, called the private key is used to decode or
    decrypt the code.

    other party the public key, which gives them access to your virtual wallet. However,
    for them to collect on your payment, they must also have the private key, which
    gives them access to the allocated funds.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cryptocurrency removes the decision-making power from a central location and
    transfers it to the parties involved. Rather than having all the data maintained
    on a single server, the information is stored on a network of centric systems
    that all follow the same basic mathematical rules that have already been agreed
    upon.
  prefs: []

- en: With a decentralized network, no individual or group has a lot of control over
    what happens to the money. Its value is determined by the people who are actually
    using the system. Since every person is connected to every other person, there
    is no centralized point of weakness where it can fail and impact a mass number
    of members.

    the same resources and perform similar functions for users within an integrated

    forming them into blocks and solving the mathematical codes. It’s sort of a first

    the next block to the Blockchain and gets a reward for finding the solution.

    in the system has the same access to all transaction histories. Even if a database
    cannot be changed, everyone will still have access to every transaction in the
