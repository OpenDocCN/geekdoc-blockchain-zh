- en: “Hello. I’m to blame for JavaScript.” A slightly pudgy, affable, fifty-five-year-old
    American computer programmer stands on stage in the gilded Vienna Volkstheater.
    This is Brendan Eich, the co-founder of Mozilla and the inventor of the Firefox
    browser, starting his 2016 TEDx talk “How to Fix the Web.” He bows, with his hands
    on his head miming his embarrassment.

- en: The young Eich wrote JavaScript in ten days in 1995 as a prototype for Netscape;
    its name reflected the fame of the better-known Java, developed earlier at Sun
    by James Gosling and promoted into an industry standard by Eric Schmidt. Eich’s
    JavaScript soon eclipsed Sun’s Java as the most widely used computer language
    in the world.

    By 2014, he had risen to be CEO of the Mozilla Foundation, with an office next
    to the Googleplex in Mountain View. Eich had turned fifty by then and already
    seemed to view his career as wrapping up. With characteristic self-depreciation,
    he had written in his blog the previous year, “Mozilla is 15\. JavaScript is nearly
    18\. I am old. Lately I mostly just make rain and name things. . . . Doesn’t make
    up for not getting to name JavaScript.”

    2008 Eich had donated a thousand dollars to the California Proposition 8 campaign
    for traditional marriage caused an uproar, despite his having been described even
    by people who disagreed with him on the issue as “a thoughtful, nerdy, humble
    guy—the kind of guy you want to corner at a party and talk about Web technologies
    with for an hour.” Eich became an unlikely scapegoat, and his time at Mozilla
    was suddenly over.

- en: By this point, the powerful programming language with the second-hand name had
    revealed its own secret side. By providing a way for webpages to set cookies,
    JavaScript had become a crucial component in targeted ads and invasive tracking
    of Web users. Cookies are a memory element on your computer that a website can
    control. They can be sweet when they remember you after you leave a site and allow
    you to toggle back to it without reentering your user name and password. They
    are a menace when they are used by rogue websites to insert malware on your machine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After his sudden ouster from Mozilla, Eich seemed renewed. Returning to programming,
    he launched the revolutionary new Brave Browser that remedies the bad effects
    of cookies and turns the tables on every top-down Internet empire. He financed
    Brave with one of the first, most lucrative, and most strategic of crypto-token
    sales. In this sale, Brave raised some $36 million in a couple hours—which then
    multiplied when the price of Ethereum’s coin soared.

- en: These crypto-token sales, known as “initial coin offerings” (ICOs) are a type
    of cryptocurrency crowdfunding. In generating these tokens, entrepreneurs have
    tapped as much as $7 billion in new capital by essentially pre-selling unbundled
    components of equity in the guise of products to be developed. Ethereum, as an
    open-source “virtual machine,” allows end-users to construct specific binding
    programs, scrupulously assuring compliance with regulations. Thus it has become
    the preferred token engine.

- en: The first such token sale happened in 2013, after President Obama signed the
    Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act, which seemed to bless this kind
    of expansion of startup money from non-credentialed investors. Tokens represent
    not ownership shares of a company but rather various goods, services, gift cards,
    and other elements of a company’s value proposition. Often issued by the millions
    or more and initially selling for millicents, they create a community of interest
    for a project without precisely defining the purchasers’ rights. Although 46 percent
    of the tokens issued as of this writing have already failed, becoming worthless,
    all tokens are not alike. Those that work offer participation in a new architecture
    for an afflicted world economy and dysfunctional financial system. Token sales
    have clearly replaced IPOs and other equity issues as a fundraising device for
    tech startups.

- en: Now in 2018, however, everyone involved in the field is nervously watching the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. Having suppressed IPOs so thoroughly, the
    SEC has turned its sights on ICOs as well. The leading lawyers in this field believe
    that such presales of goods and services—to be supplied or even defined, for the
    most part, later—skirt the mandate of the SEC and even its jurisdiction. After
    all, companies sell goods and services all the time in a variety of ways without
    any thought of the SEC. But the commission begs to differ. Deciding that virtually
    all tokens are securities and thus indeed under its jurisdiction, the SEC threatens
    drastically to increase the legal cost of cryptographic innovation in the United
    States. The danger is that it will extend the doldrums into which it has led the
    entrepreneurial economy and drive the industry out of the country.

    the other side of the looking glass. He is one of the few people in the field
    who seem totally unruffled. And his aim is high. He conceived these “Basic Attention
    Tokens” to bring down Google. Or at least send Page and Brin back to the drawing
    board for a new strategy. The mild-mannered Eich will hit them with a billion
    BATs.

    Internet would lead to a more targeted and effective advertising system that would
    deliver only the ads the viewer wanted. I thought the balance of power would shift
    from advertisers to customers. As Eich observes, “That didn’t happen. Instead,
    the ad-tech ecosystem became a bewildering variety of middlemen and complexity. . . .
    ”

    poor reporting and targeting.”

    2017 details this crisis of Internet advertising. The situation is winner-take-all.
    Ninety-nine percent of the growth goes to Google and Facebook. Publishers—whether
    of websites, books, games, or music—are left with the final 1 percent. It is fraught
    with fraud. In 2016, fake ad demand generated by Internet bots cost advertisers
    some $7.2 billion, with ad malware to trick users rising 132 percent since 2015.

    market in the industry—smartphones. Customers increasingly are paying their bandwidth
    suppliers not for the content they seek but for the noise of ad delivery overhead.
    At popular publishers’ sites, as much as 79 percent of the mobile data are ads.
    On average, smartphone users pay twenty-three dollars per month for ads, trackers,
    scripts, and other diversionary chaff that bears malware, slows load-times, piles
    on data-plan costs, depletes battery life, and tramples privacy and property rights.

    the center of the existing digital advertising ecosystem. They benefit from the
    complexity and opacity that defines it. BAT intends to empower the very users
    and publishers that are receiving less than they should.”

    It frustrates users with slow loads, wastes bandwidth on unwanted ads, and wipes
    out publishers’ profits—and it’s not even secure. As Jonathan Taplan documents
    relentlessly in Move Fast and Break Things, the Google regime of aggregate and
    advertise is drastically reducing the income of musicians, journalists, and other
    producers of the content that Google seeks to monetize with ads and search.

    to ad-blockers, which may ultimately bring down the whole kit and caboodle, including
    Google. The most avid ad-blockers are millennials, whose typically limited bandwidth
    and high-cost data connections leave their smartphones clogged and jammed by advertising
    and its overhead.

    ads.” But traditional push-advertising is a failed technology, regardless of “acceptability.”
    No one wants to sit through an ad, however cleverly or deceptively presented,
    before watching a YouTube video. As the ad-free subscription service YouTube Red
    grows more popular, Google is discovering that no one really wants any gratuitous
    ads. They are value-subtracted, minuses, or even mines—as Google itself acknowledges
    when it lets customers pay for their removal by subscribing to ad-free services.

    Simon, the Carnegie Mellon information theorist: “What information consumes is
    the attention of the recipients. A wealth of information creates a poverty of
    attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance
    of information sources that might consume it.”'

    another word for time. As I explain in The Scandal of Money, time translates into

    and Facebook, through many stomachs of intermediation. Like print publishers in
    the past, they earn profits not chiefly from content but from the time, indirectly
    measured, their readers give to ads. But Google and others are discovering that
    human attention can be depleted. As Eich remarks, it sinks away “until dopamine
    levels recover.” Already evident is an Internet epidemic of “banner blindness.”

- en: Into this breach Eich is hurling his one billion BATs—the unit of exchange for
    an ingenious new decentralized open-source and efficient digital advertising platform
    based on Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum blockchain. Advertisers award BATs to publishers
    based on the attention of users measured by the pattern of their usage. Users
    too will be paid in BATs for accepting ads that they want to see or choose to
    tolerate in exchange for micropayments. They can donate these BATs back to favored
    publishers or use them in exchange for content.
  prefs: []

    delivering fewer but more relevant ads that users actually seek. Publishers gain
    a larger share of the returns while advertisers get better reporting and performance
    and customers get ads they explicitly accept for pay. Rather than manipulating
    the viewer to see ads, advertisers find viewers who are interested in their appeals.
    Eich concludes, “Brave will reset the online ad-based Web ecosystem, giving advertisers,
    publishers, and customers a win-win solution whose components and protocols can
    become future Web standards.”

    in which you own your own dossier; it’s your own online life—you should own your
    own data. If you own it, then you can give terms of service [to the giant walled
    gardens on the Web], as well as them giving you their ‘terms of service’ that
    no one ever reads. . . . This would create a new web.”

    indistinguishable for many purposes from the topology of the real world. As Kevin
    Kelly breathlessly describes it, “We’ll use it to visit environments too dangerous
    to risk in the flesh, such as war zones, deep seas, or volcanoes. Or we’ll use
    it for experiences we can’t easily get to as humans—to visit the inside of a stomach,
    the surface of a comet. Or to swap genders, or [as Jaron Lanier wants] become
    a lobster. Or to cheaply experience something expensive, like a flyby of the Himalayas.”[²](notes.html#ch16note-2)

    Musical works, for example, combine contributions from composers, lyricists, performers,

    OTOY white paper explains: “Blockchains can handle intricate property rights needed
    for complex digital assets that can be routinely copied and for which time-stamped
    proof of authorship is crucial. Tokens, on the other hand, enable immediate many-sided

    custom hardware chips that take up to ten years to specify and burn into silicon.
