- en: In this chapter we will explore the areas where Blockchain technology can solve
    some of the current issues organizations are facing. When I say ‘solve’, I am
    giving you the practical advice to help solve the issues; obviously, the actual
    solving of these issues will depend on many factors, including your organization
    and how you actually implement these solutions.

    now I want to look at *how* Blockchain technology will solve the top four issues
    for organizations.  ## Trust'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We operate in a very complex world where trust has reduced and often evaporated
    when dealing with business, governments, communities, and processes. I would argue
    that trust has never really existed in most cases.

- en: For example, for a retailer, there is the challenge to trust the suppliers and
    the partners in the supply chain. The supply chain is key to the success of a
    retailer, but there is always an underlying mistrust in the data and the transactions.
    This leads to a significant level of wasted time and resources on proving who
    has the current data and who is correct.

- en: Another great example is intercompany – within any global organization, there
    will always be discrepancies in data between the entities, firstly due to the
    old legacy systems, and secondly, due to the differing structures and competing
    priorities of each entity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All this lack of trust means that organizations spend significant amounts of
    time and resources on auditing and reconciling data – this is carried out after
    the transaction has been shared and reported. More importantly, the data is reconciled
    and audited after decisions have been made – this means that organizations are
    making decisions based on incorrect data.

- en: If we agree that trust does not exist (whether it did in the first place or
    not is irrelevant), then we should start to implement Blockchain technology at
    speed; the main solution of Blockchain is to improve trust between parties who
    do not trust each other.

    rules and the data will enter the system, significantly more accurate than previously.
    If it is incorrect, it will be found to be incorrect quickly and corrections can

    customers, and organizations are open and transparent. A world where you can trust
    the data you have been given and can talk openly about the effect of this information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The shared nature of Blockchain technology allows connected parties to share
    their data safely and securely. All parties will agree to what data is shared
    and with whom, this is then made available to all parties in real time. Decisions
    and discussions are made using this open and shared data.

- en: Using shared open data must improve an organization's efficiency and no doubt
    performance. You will be able to use more relevant, accurate, and reliable information
    to prepare your analysis. This analysis will often lead to business decisions,
    which will have been made on better data.

    or changed in any way. This is a fundamental concept and a great benefit to help
    improve trust and partnerships.

    it means that the data has been entered into the Blockchain via the agreed consensus
    mechanisms, which inherently should make the data more likely to be correct.

    you can quickly trace where the data was incorrect, and the details of the transaction.
    You can then quickly rectify the data once you have investigated what went wrong
    and why.  ## Transactions Automation – Smart Contracts'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A large part of the Blockchain technology infrastructure is the automation of
    certain transactions and tasks – often called smart contracts. In basic terms,
    these are the same as computer programming language, where people write simple
    code in an executable language.
  prefs: []

- en: Contracts are the most important form of transactions which we would use a smart
    contract for. There are many opportunities and challenges for the legal side of
    smart contracts, which is a current hot topic in all Blockchain circles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to look at smart contracts is to call it ‘automating transactions’.
    If we view a smart contract as automation, we can see that there are many tasks
    in our organizations which could be improved using automated transactions.

- en: Let's take an example of a common transaction where we have a set of transactions
    to expire at a certain time each month (e.g. prepayments and accruals). These
    transactions are often reversed at the start of each month and then set up again
    at the end of each month. We could write a smart contract to automatically reverse
    the transaction and check the data on the end of the next month to automatically
    post again (if the transaction meets agreed criteria).

    but it will require changes in legislation and adoption by legal institutions

    if you take the ‘front to back’ thinking, then you will now have a whole set of

  prefs: []

- en: One of my challenges to organizations over time has been to ‘do less processing’
    and ‘do more analysis’. Analysis is looking at the data and drawing out themes
    and conclusions from this data, on which you can then make an informed decision.
    Too often, I see organizations that spend too long collating the data, and the
    decision-making process is often rushed and incomplete.

    to analyse this data, and you have used the data real time from the Blockchain
    parties (whose data you would not normally see). This has to make a better, more
    rounded and well-researched decision and I would go so far as to say, this would
    allow new opportunities which had previously been lost in the data be surfaced
    and put into action.
