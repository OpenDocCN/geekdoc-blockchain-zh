    front of him. From his podium on the second floor of the Capital Hotel in Little
    Rock, he spies a familiar figure in the corner. It is the six-foot-four-inch form
    of Hunter Hillenmeyer. For seven years a defensive back with the Chicago Bears,
    he is now a strategist and spokesman for the Nashville company Strivr, perhaps
    the world’s leader in finding valuable new markets for virtual reality.

    technology, Hillenmeyer is a bigger star than Manning. He points out that Moore’s
    Law has brought the price of virtual reality gear down to one-tenth or less of
    what it was in the heydays of Doug Trumbull and Jaron Lanier. Today, Facebook’s
    Oculus Rift headsets cost less than a thousand dollars—still prohibitively expensive
    for the consumer market but cheap compared with previous VR systems.

    has focused on the details of delivering a full experience of virtual learning.
    The key is breaking through the user’s frontal cortex. That’s the “thinking,”
    deciding, problem-solving part of the brain, which knows the virtual experience
    is unreal. Bypassing these lobes of intelligence, VR operates on the so-called
    reptilian brain behind, where a suspension of disbelief allows the memory to be
    imprinted with a “real” experience. By fostering this cerebral phase change, virtual
    reality can accelerate the learning process for most jobs.

    Hillenmeyer is talking about. I don the Oculus headset, and after some juggling
    of my glasses—whoops!—I fumble away my frontal cortex. It must be around here
    somewhere, but plunged into the middle of a Dallas Cowboys’ huddle as quarterback,
    I am engulfed. Virtually in Dak Prescott’s shoes, I’m preparing to throw a pass
    to wide receiver Cole Beasley. Fully immersed in the play, I all but fall off
    the stage avoiding the rush as I crisply complete the pass.

    Hillenmeyer formulated his RIDE principle: The opportunities for virtual reality
    are found in events that are too rare, impossible, dangerous, or expensive for
    ordinary people to experience. My pass play for the Cowboys, in which VR preserves
    me from any chance of being stomped by a three-hundred-pound defensive end, reflects
    all four conditions.'

    and preparing oil rig engineers in special-purpose training cells. Then it triumphed
    as gear to test and design products. As Lanier points out in Dawn of the New Everything,
    “Every vehicle you’ve occupied in the last two decades, whether it rolls, floats,
    or flies, was prototyped with VR.”[¹](notes.html#epinote-1)

    Friday” rush at Walmart, whose Walmart Academy is a major Strivr customer. Because
    of the rate of turnover in Walmart’s workforce, some 40 percent of managers have
    never experienced this once-a-year tornado. Strivr plunges trainees into the midst
    of the chaos and enables them to complete transactions without being trampled.
    Walmart reports that trainees who have practiced using VR perform more confidently
    and effectively under actual conditions.

    the U.S. Olympic ski team. Gathered in Park City, Utah, the team used VR to experience
    the downhill course in South Korea, site of the 2018 winter games. Mikaela Shiffrin,
    Lindsey Vonn, and the other Olympians could experience the course, viscerally
    vamping through every twist and turn, without risk of a season-ending injury,
    or worse.

    lung cancer rate is fifty times higher than the rest of the population’s. Every
    year, firefighters have to train in smoky conditions where they inhale toxic fumes.
    Using Strivr, they can experience smoky vision without inhaling. Still more vital,
    they learn to identify the visual and auditory signs of an impending “flash-over
    event,” in which flames can suddenly sweep them up.

    it’s real. The fact that Walmart and United Rentals are using VR will have a lasting
    impact on the VR industry at large.” Specializing in rentals of construction equipment,
    United Rentals has faced the problem of inducing its customers to learn safety
    practices on site. “They just won’t do it.” Using VR, though, the company reduces
    liability risks while improving safety and productivity.

    Trends Report by Mary Meeker of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. She reports

    beings, VR fosters an industry of prosthetic extensions—goggles, gloves, scrolling
    floors, haptic syntheses, and sensory fusions—that extend the boundaries of human
    experience, ultimately conveying movement, force, resistance, heat, sharpness,
    and other interactive effects. Just as Strivr can train firemen and skiers, these
    advances can improve the training of nurses, emergency services, surgeons, and
    even physicists.

    of a visit earlier that day by the writer-physicist-celebrity Lisa Randall of
    Harvard, a paragon of TED talks and New York Times bestsellers and another candidate
    to live forever without believing in God. Randall had dropped by OTOY to discuss
    Jules’s Octane VR rendering tool, which measures and interprets the movements,
    reflections, refractions, and interactions of photons. She saw it as an empirically
    tested model of photon behavior that might offer clues to the multidimensional
    nature of light.

    had told Jules that the process of rendering images offers a new way to decrypt
    the cosmos. Everything starts with photons, and photons go back to the Big Bang.
    In making a computer-generated image, OTOY maps a mini-bang of the emissions and
    reflections of photonic rays in a terrestrial scene. Rendering algorithms is an
    empirical quest to explain reality, with human enlightenment as both the source
    and the goal.

    to its roots in trust and security. Information theory always expounded reality
    from two sides. On one side it measures and enables communication, transmission,
    redundancy, and reliable copying across time and space. On the other side, it
    focuses on decoding and decrypting the hidden dimensions of reality shrouded in
    noise. On one side, it is a copying machine; on the other side, it is a truth
    machine, attempting to resolve the ground states of the world.

    the world was preoccupied with communication across a noisy channel. Questions
    of truth and consequences deferred to questions of signal and noise. Information
    Theory began with “Communications Theory for Secrecy Systems.” This paper proved
    that a perfect randomized one-time-pad constitutes an unbreakable code. It is
    a pillar of the theory of information as it defines one pole of a continuum between
    noise (white noise, purely random) and perfect order (predictable, deterministic,
    and information-free).

    (controlled or bounded probability), that constitute the challenge of communications,
    codes, encryption, and decryption. In this pursuit he addressed the problem of

    big data, machine-learning, and artificial intelligence that fueled the Google

    gain efficiency and speed by rigorously eclipsing the past, blockchains elaborately
    perpetuate the past in every block with a mathematical hash. Perhaps ten thousand
    times slower to compute than Markov chains, every hash contains an indelible signature
    of all transactions going back to the original block. Markov chains tell you the
    statistically likely future without knowing the past; blockchains enable the real-life
    future by indelibly recording the past.

    it with the assumption of randomness. Removing the specific intentions and plans,
    histories and identities from their calculus, Markov models represent a flight

    of the world will see the ascent of memory and specificity, invention and factuality,
    timestamps and titles—what Chaitin, the greatest surviving information theorist,
