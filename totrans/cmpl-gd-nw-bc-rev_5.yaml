    a verification mechanism for both transactions and asset ownership. A single copy
    of the transactions is stored in a shared, distributed, ledger that is replicated
    across the network, so each member has the exact same accurate copy of the transaction
    activity in near real-time. The unique benefits that accrue from a Blockchain
    are:'

    to know or trust each other to take part in transactions.

    can contain quality assurance specifications or ownership history or anything
    else of value for a given asset.

    by a trusted third party). There is a whole chapter of the book dedicated to this
    topic.

    added to the main chain. There is no Delete or Update command in the Blockchain
    sphere as exists with other databases.

    Let’s first take a look at the characteristics of a public Blockchain. Most likely,
    you have heard of Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum. Both of these and several others
    in the marketplace today operate using public Blockchains.'

- en: '**Public blockchains** are permission-zero distributed ledgers. That means
    that ANYONE can join the network and you don’t have to be asked nor do you need
    permission to join the network. Public Blockchains are anonymous so members don’t
    have to reveal who they are to participate.'

- en: Open blockchains also have anonymous validation which means that anyone can
    participate in the Consensusprocess that validates transactions. This opens the
    door for potential bad guys to try and tamper with the data in a Blockchain. This
    topic will be covered extensively later on.

    systems*.* Trust is not a prerequisite for doing business on the network. You
    do not have to know, or like, or trust the other party in a transaction on a public
    Blockchain. And, these blockchains are where “Brave New World” apps are being
    developed. In other words, applications on a public Blockchain are those that
    didn’t exist or couldn’t have existed before Blockchains but are now being developed
    - like cryptocurrencies.

- en: Now let’s contrast public Blockchains with private Blockchains. There are several
    private Blockchains that are available on the marketplace. HyperLedger, which
    has big backing by IBM, and Ripple which focuses on high transaction throughput
    in the financial markets are two of the most well-known private Blockchains.

- en: The first distinctive quality of a private Blockchain is that, it is based on
    a permissioned private ledger. Who can participate in the network and who can
    validate transactions is known and vetted in advance. Participants must have a
    level of trust within the network and be invited to join the network.

- en: Since private Blockchains usually have large corporations as participants, sensitive
    data will often be stored “off the chain” while consensus and validation information
    will be store inside the blockchain. For example, the fact that two companies
    agreed on a contract can be validated inside of the Blockchain, while the actual
    terms of the contract might be stored “off chain” in a relational database. Private
    Blockchains are the choice for “reconstructing existing world applications” where
    old applications get a facelift with Blockchain technology to gain the processing
    efficiencies that were discussed earlier.
