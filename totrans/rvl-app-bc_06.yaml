- en: Technological advancements in the transportation/automotive industry are continually
    increasing due to competition and consumer demands. The mobile open blockchain
    initiative (MOBI) is one way organizations are coming together to share innovating
    ways to revolutionize the transportation/automotive industry. This chapter explains
    the events that lead to the innovation of an open consortium, MOBI, and its members
    and highlights some of the cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods where
    blockchain is being adopted by the transportation/automotive industry.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite Blockchain being a relatively new concept, there are many initiatives
    currently in existence (Cao, Wang, Li, Gu, and Chen, 2019). Once such initiative
    is the MOBI (Bothos, Magoutas, Arnaoutaki, and Mentzas, 2019). This initiative
    was founded by a few leading automakers and launch in early May of 2018 at the
    Dubai Future Blockchain Summit (Russell, 2018). Today, MOBI is a thriving consortium
    for blockchain innovation in the mobility industry with many prestigious academic
    institutions and global organizations including, but not limited to, IBM, Accenture,
    and ConsenSys. (Lannquist, 2018; Polluck, 2019). By using blockchain technology,
    this potential initiative hopes to make mobility safe, secure, cheaper, and greener
    through the creation of blockchain use cases and technology standards for automotive
    applications (Bothos et al., 2019; Griffin, 2019; Lannquist, 2018). Additionally,
    MOBI hopes to make mobility more accessible, especially to those currently with
    issues in obtaining such technology. While MOBI has partnered with many prestigious
    academic institutions, more partnerships are needed. However, finding and identifying
    possible Blockchain researchers is not an easy task (Cao et al., 2019). Many IT
    or business educators struggle with the basic understanding of Blockchain, in
    general (Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen, and Wang, 2018). This chapter discusses MOBI via
    identity, customers, competition, technology, and trends. This work has practical
    implications for IT programs and faculty wishing to explore or adopt Blockchain
    or MOBI within their curriculum. This chapter provides future MOBI researchers
    with an overview of its evolution, members, technology, and reveal points on which
    special efforts should be explored in the near future. The remainder of this paper
    is structured as follows. A brief overview of the transformation of the automotive
    industry and blockchain is introduced in section 2\. Section 3 presents MOBI and
    its members. Blockchain technologies are explored in section 4\. This area specifically
    discusses internet of things (IOTs), cloud computing, smart products and objects,
    along with smart contracts, sensors, and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Section 5
    provides insights on upcoming trends and section 6 concludes the paper.

    transportation industry, the use of blockchain and the velocity of MOBI. Over
    the past two decades, transportation has dramatically transformed with the advent
    of smart cars autonomous vehicles (AVs), and connected cars (Jeong, Youn, Jho
    & Shin, 2020). Furthermore, the mobility and innovation of transportation has
    also experienced tremendous growth and extensive research.

    to enhance the driving experience. For example, global positioning systems (GPS)
    and geographical information systems to aid in vehicle navigation and location.
    Sensors aid with blind spots, braking, and many other vehicle safety measures.
    However, there is limited simultaneous integration with other public or private
    systems outside of the smart car. As a result, AVs emerge as they leveraged Mobility
    as a Service (MaaS) to gain a more completive advantage by using multiple public
    and private systems to feed information into the vehicle (Bothos et al., 2019;
    Jeong et al. 2020).

    two-way communication network between the car and the connected data points throughout
    it’s entire infrastructure. They proposed a blockchain data marketplace model.
    This allowed for system security to be handled on- and off the chain via a data-owner
    attributed based encryption (DO-ABE). Thus, the data owner can better control

    vast, and evolving. Du, Gao, Wu, Wong & Bi (2020) argue that there is little research
    on the sustainability impact on utilizing blockchain across multiple intelligent
    transportation systems and their stakeholder. They explained how blockchain-based
    intelligent transportation is attracting world-wide attention within the automobile
    and transportation industry. Utilizing the fuzzy, DEMATEL and ISM set theories,
    they created a theorical framework of an intelligent transportation system to
    explain blockchain as a sustainable and secure system among multiple stakeholders.
    Their framework also elaborated upon how blockchain is very secure but computationally
    expensive to implement. They believed that regardless of the limited research
    and high cost, the blockchain within the transportation industry will rapidly
    expand.

    research for IBM Institute for Business Value in collaboration with Oxford Economics
    on automotive blockchain use. Utilizing an online survey instrument, they examined
    1,314 automotive executives’ perspectives regarding their exportation with blockchain.
    Participants were from 10 functional areas throughout 10 different countries.
    Results revealed that 62% of the executives believe that blockchain will be a
    “disruptive force”. Additionally, more than half of the executives anticipate
    new business models will influence their blockchain plans within the next few
    years. More importantly, 54% indicated their first commercial blockchain network
    will be within the next three years.

    transparency among users. It is often referred to as a disruptive technological
    innovation which is steering to novel global changes (Appelbaum & Smith, 2019;
    Cao, et al., 2019; Du et al., 2020; Hawlitschek, Notheisen, and Teubner, 2018).
    It is a decentralized database utilizing distributed storage, consensus, encryption
    algorithms, and smart contracts. Data is digitally signed, and time stamped as
    every block is added to the blockchain. Each block on the blockchain is connected
    or joined via a hash. The blockchain is housed on distributed storage which allows
    for data sharing (Du et al., 2020).

    do not have to store data in third-party data warehouses. Instead they can distribute
    the data on interlinked electronic devices to create a network. Thus, if a hack
    occurs on one electronic device, the whole interlinked network can halt acceptance
    of new data or changes to data (Kestenbaum, 2017).

    security. Huh and Seo (2018) state that blockchain is understood to be the best
    level of security. Knowing that blockchain possesses a secure state of data, it
    has become an attractive technology for many to explore implementation. However,
    many organizations are still unsure about the use of blockchain technology. As
    a result, the development of MOBI emerged.

    Recently they implemented their first blockchain technology and the vehicle identification
    number i.e VINblock. The VINblock is one of the many new initiates that aid multiple
    stakeholders over the lifetime of any vehicle. Specifically, it keeps record of
    all activities of a registered through their VINnumber on the DMX blockchain.
    The VINblock starts with setting the vehicle as a minimum representation of that
    vehicle’s creation. From there, subsequent vehicle identification phases will
    be added to include product definition, history of ownership, and important events
    in the vehicle’s life (such as accidents, body work, recalls, and more). While
    this is newly created, guidance is needed on and off-chain data. Thus, all the
    VIN information should be collected (Adams, 2020).

    the mobility initiative. A goal of this initiative with regards to technology
    is to stimulate scalable adoption of technology by companies developing autonomous
    vehicle and mobility services. Using blockchain technology will ensure to eliminate
    mileage fraud because it will establish a transparent, anonymous, and tamper-proof
    database. Thus, it is important to explain on-chain and off the chain governance
    when explaining MOBI technologies.

- en: Blockchain governance is a process that allows a decision-making process to
    provide for permissions on and off the block (Kampik & Najjar, 2020). Not all
    data included within a transaction needs to be computed on the blockchain. Transactions
    on the blockchain are expensive for both storage and authorization. Authorization
    through a third party of translational acceptance governance is required to accept
    the transaction to the chain. Off-chain computation bypasses the permissions needed
    for blockchain transactional acceptance from outside approval; rather, it uses
    established and authorized individuals on the network for consensus finding as
    well as allowing for trust within the storage system (Eberhardt & Tai, 2017).
    The future of off the chain use is still constrained, keeping the information
    on block, but off-chain allows data to be protected and restricted from public
    view. Therefore, the current research is combining blockchain with distributed
    storage to keep data storage low and allow the system to focus on the approval
    of the data that needs the protection of the chain (Kawaguchi, 2019).

    idea that information and transactions can systematically be recorded through
    a cryptographic process in a public database so that all stakeholders involved
    in the network can contribute to the validation of the information” (p.1). The
    technology that allows the “information” and “transactions” to be processed is
    dependent upon the support of the communication and analytical platform. This

    and Gamble conference presentation (Ashton, 2009). When first defined, the term
    IoT was meant to describe the need of human interaction for computers to gain
    information. Since then, IoT has assumed many different roles and descriptions
    such as a paradigm, concept, network along as many other terms. Thus, as a paradigm,
    IoT is a new way of interconnection of technology to the internet. As a concept,
    IoT is that small computing devices or “things” can communicate with other “things”
    via wireless connectivity. As a network, the IoT is paving the way to use the
    IoT to connect devices, sensors, or smart objects to create their own IoT system
    (Arellanes & Lau, 2020).

    a control system. A control system can receive and accumulate the data sent by
    the devices but can also process sending commands in response to the data sent
    (Sabir et al., 2020). This information, once received, can also be sent to cloud
    for storage. As Chanson et al. (2019) asserts, cloud solutions and sharing sensor
    data are becoming more of a common practice which can allow more collaboration
    throughout the organizational technology ecosystem. The collaboration of IoT sharing
    of data can intertwine the blockchain technology.

    industry is the IoT. According to Griffin (2019), MOBI believes that the use of
    IoT can enable cars to verify their identities autonomously, maneuver complex
    rules, and interact effectively with other automobiles and road infrastructure.
    As a result of this technology, motor vehicles will become safer and more efficient.
    Additionally, MOBI’s business platform also includes mobility management software,
    computers, wearables, and IoT sensors (“MOBI Launches Grand Challenge for Blockchain
    in Transport Sector”, n.d.). Essentially, the use of these digital devices and
    strategies has enabled the consortium to better integrate with unified endpoint
    management (UEM) (Mearian, 2018). These technologies have further enhanced MOBI’s
    proficiency in the management of mobility services.

    With regards to MOBI, IoT sensors calculate the parking charges for the parking
    duration, and the billing takes place directly through the crypto wallet (Subramanian
    et al., 2020). The integration of IoT in blockchain technology has facilitated
    the real-time detection of vehicles and the determination of the available parking
    space. IoT has widened the scope of blockchain technology as it allows for the
    innovation to disrupt and redefine operations in the automotive industry, especially

    (Zhu et al., 2020). The use of cloud technology allows for blockchain to be used
    and produces a decentralized and distributed storage (Cearnau, 2019). The use
    of blockchain infrastructure and cloud infrastructure can be comparatively similar
    and can both be run on decentralized applications. The use of blockchain in the
    cloud provides networking, machine algorithms, and storage. The networking power
    that the cloud platform can provide can access large bandwidth. Machine algorithms
    can provide an enhanced level of security and encryption. Finally, the ability
    to use cloud storage allows for scalability to meet the needs of the user in order
    to facility the blockchain usage.

    industry is also part of MOBI’s ambitions. MOBI aims to use cloud computing to
    provide on-demand digital systems resources, such as data storage and enhancing
    computing power to eliminate the need for users’ direct and active management
    of these systems (Lannquist, 2018). Cloud computing has been particularly useful
    in the vehicle identification and data tracking; due to the sensors and RFID tags
    that are fitted on blockchain manufactured vehicles, the authenticity of each
    component can be verified easily and effectively (Kucinski, 2019). MOBI plans
    to create convenient, standard, and digital ways of paying for mobility services,
    motor vehicle identification, managing trips, and secure exchange and monetization
    of data in ways that protect property rights and privacy (“MOBI Launches Grand
    Challenge for Blockchain in Transport Sector”, n.d.). In doing so, MOBI will revolutionize

    They include sensor connection, software communication, and storage to use and
    optimize data interaction (Rijsdijk & Hultink, 2009) Smart products can be categorized
    as semiautonomous or autonomous. A smart product that is semiautonomous requires
    human input to function, whereas autonomous smart products can function without
    any human input to function (Kahle et al., 2020). The ability of a Smart product
    to be used in an antonymous fashion lends itself to security issues. For example,
    a hacker can gain entry to an autonomous smart product that stores information
    to the cloud regarding the user or products behavior (Riel et al., 2018)

    with its partners to procure smart contracts and experiment with blockchain technology
    (“MOBI Launches Grand Challenge for Blockchain in Transport Sector”, n.d.). MOBI
    also focuses on enhancing the confirmation of vehicle identity, as well as tracking
    their history, supply chain data, transparency, and efficiency (Kucinski, 2019).
    Autonomous vehicle payments and secure mobility ecosystem trade are other smart
    products from MOBI (“MOBI Launches Grand Challenge for Blockchain in Transport
    Sector”, n.d.). The consortium also manages related services such as usage-based
    mobility pricing, motor vehicle insurance, energy production and consumption,
    environmental pollution, and improvement of road infrastructure (Zoria, 2019).
    According to Griffin (2019), MOBI is also trialing the application of blockchain
    technology in paying for car parking tickets as well as highway tolls. Therefore,
    it is evident that MOBI’s goals stretch beyond creating a greener automotive industry.
    This idea is evidenced by the consortium’s plans to use blockchain to create a
    smart future for the road transportation sector.

    similar to smart products but do benefit more fully with the data sharing connection
    through an IoT. Smart objects have the ability to be self-autonomous but are more
    frequently seen within the semi-autonomous division, whereas the data is needed
    from the user interaction to accumulate and learn from the user’s behavior (Perez
    Hernandez & Reiff-Marganiec, 2015). Smart objects can benefit blockchain as Lee,
    Rathore, Park, and Park (2020) found by placing blockchain technology at the gateway
    of smart objects (especially in the case of smart home objects and devices) to
    secure the data exchange.

    smart objects into MOBI technology. For instance, connected and intelligent smart
    objects enable functionality that can be divided into four areas, including autonomy,
    monitoring, optimization, and control (Yang et al., 2018). Smart objects will
    act without human intervention, which means that their functionality will be optimized
    through the algorithms and commands used to control the object remotely. Therefore,
    the incorporation of MOBI has created a centralized system for addressing the
    gap between IoT and smart objects and increasing the accuracy of the decisions
    made by smart objects. MOBI has created a framework for verifying and tracing
    all decisions made by smart objects in various industries, including the automotive
    industry; since for IoT and smart objects to succeed, a transparent and secure
    system has to be implemented to increase its reliability and prevent privacy violations.

    of MOBI has prompted the adoption of sensors and RFID to incorporate trackers
    in vehicles and navigate autonomous vehicles because of real-time detection or

    allowing settlements to happen much quicker and behind the scenes over traditional
    methods. For example, the transactions that happen in a smart contract are processed
    by the Blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without a third
    party (Kaiser et al., 2018). Similarly, it will automate the formation of contractual
    agreements since smart contracts are negotiated and completed using computer codes.
    Smart contracts have automated various aspects because they are automatically
    executed when the predetermined conditions and terms are met. The integration
    of smart contracts into MOBI has automated the sale of vehicles and parts in the
    automotive industry. It has also geared towards making autonomous vehicles a reality
    in the industry.

    the need for a middleman, rather the use of machine consensus is employed. Currently
    a P2P consensus is also utilized to share the storage of the block. The sharing
    of storage of the blockchain can range from the whole block to a single transaction.
    Trending is the use of P2P to tap into users underutilized storage with an arrangement
    of trade in the form of network usage or cryptocurrency. The importance of the
    P2P system is the redundancy of data to ensure that the pieces of the block can
    be retrieved from more than one entity.

    order for stakeholders to easily access and share relevant records, including
    with insurance policies, new buyers, and quite possibly ride-share passengers.
    Ultimately, MOBI innovators went that route and built a peer-to-peer system by
    creating a network of interconnected computers that does not rely on a central
    party to facilitate interaction (Wang et al., 2019). For example, it has integrated
    IoT to increase the connection between computer systems to facilitate virtual
    transactions. The initiative has created an autonomous computer system that supports
    mobile payments, car-wallet applications, and seamless information sharing between
    parties.

    globe. Besides its existing applications, new trends are emerging in the scope
    of blockchain technologies to increase their reach and applications in the world.
    One of the trends is the Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), which is designed to
    facilitate the creation of a complete blockchain-based infrastructure. Other trends
    include digital products such as decentralized applications (Dapps) and other
    services that can work without any setup requirements of the complete blockchain-based
    infrastructure (Banafa, 2019). The emerging trends in Blockchain are designed
    to increase the MOBI initiative's functionality and improve the relevance of peer-to-peer
    systems in the automotive industry.

    Hyperledger framework. Hyperledger technology can be used for the supply chain
    within the MOBI initiative. It has facilitated the creation of a system that supports
    transshipment and run-cross border transactions. It is built on a modular architecture
    that separates transaction processing into three phases: increasing performance,
    scalability, and improving trust level in supply chain operations. The three phases
    are distributed logic processing and agreement, transaction ordering, and transaction
    validation, and commitment (Subramanian et al., 2020). The integration into MOBI
    has focused on creating a reliable transaction system for supporting financial
    operations in various industries. Hyperledger is ideal for MOBI as it hosts a
    variety of developing business blockchain technologies that support cross-industry
    transactions.'

    The consortium has recognized this need, which is evidenced by its investment
    in the use of cryptocurrency. Mearian (2018) conveys that cryptocurrency has been
    fundamental in the development of blockchain technology in the recent past. As
    the future of the Bitcoin industry grows uncertain, the experts in this field
    have projected that distributed ledger technology will be critical to the growth
    of various industries (Zoria, 2019). According to Zoria (2019), the future of
    blockchain technology will be primarily driven by consortia and related open innovation
    working strategies. Furthermore, Mearian (2018) opines that the consortiums should
    also address competitive privacy and security issues in order to boost their chances
    of achieving their goals. However, MOBI’s blockchain technology will face stiff
    competition from fellow blockchains in the near future.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past few decades, there have been growing concerns about environmental
    pollution across the world. Consequently, national governments, companies, and
    humanitarian organizations globally have been making efforts to improve environmental
    conservation. In response to this initiative, several renowned motor vehicle manufacturing
    companies came together in 2017 to create the MOBI, a non-profit consortium that
    seeks to improve operations in this sector. In essence, MOBI’s objective is to
    make motor vehicle transport safer, greener, more affordable, and more accessible
    (“Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative “, 2020). According to Boucherat (2020),
    most automotive manufacturers concur with the fact that a lack of scale and harmonized
    production standards make it more difficult to establish and benefit from blockchains.
    The current automotive companies that are members of MOBI include BMW, Ford, General
    Motors, Honda, Groupe Renault, Bosch, and Hyundai; the consortium also has several
    partners from outside the automotive industry, such as IBM, Hyperledger, Accenture,
    Bigchain, Exasys, Vestella, Fetch, AI, AAIS and Quant (Industry Week Staff, 2018).
    The collaboration of these companies, via MOBI, will make more realistic to enhance
    technology in the automotive sector and friendlier to the environment.

    will provide a framework for the other industries to follow in creating a blockchain
    mobility platform. As an example, this initiative could be applied to the education
    industry, where people could potentially store their education history, degrees,
    courses, diplomas, dates, schools, etc. on the blockchain easily accessible by
    the mobility initiative. This could help future employers or future educational
    institutions to quickly and easily verify education history for the person.

- en: By utilizing cutting edge technology, especially around the transportation industry
    at this time, the initiative will be successful. It gives the flexibility to not
    only adopt new technology but be a leader in creating cutting edge technology.
    Additionally, by using new technology and being an innovator in technology and
    blockchain, the initiative will stay competitive. Even though this initiative
    will set the stage for other industries and companies to adopt a blockchain mobility
    platform, the transportation industry is quite large and will continue to grow
    for the years to come. If this initiative keeps up with the latest technology
    and makes updates as required, the need for this platform will continue to be
    relevant and competitive. Just as the start of the internet set the stage for
    many new technologies and ways of connecting twenty years ago, we believe that
    this initiative will be setting the stage for new ideas yet to come.
