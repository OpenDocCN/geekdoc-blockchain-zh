    The Chinese government has long kept tight reins on both traditional and new media

    They achieve this through selective censorship of political expression and by
    using state media to influence crucial audiences. Although such censorship practices
    were traditionally aimed at broadcast and print media, the emergence of the internet
    and social media, in particular, prompted some authoritarian regimes, such as
    the Assad regime in Syria, to try to exert a similar level of censorship on the
    internet as well. During the Arab Spring, the Syrian regime blocked hundreds of
    websites that provided social networking, news, and other services. Taking Syria
    as a case study, media research indicates that internet censorship succeeded in
    preventing internet users from reaching censored online content during the Arab
    Spring of 2010–12\. Syrians fought back by using technology that circumvents website-blocking
    tools [325].

- en: A peer-to-peer decentralised system could combat the growing problem posed by
    both government censorship and ‘fake news’. The key to any success in combating
    fake news will be the use of reputation systems to provide a clear and reliable
    indication to readers that the content they are reading is not fabricated or manipulated.
    This is not easy. The decentralisation of information poses one of the blockchain’s
    biggest challenges. How does one decide which source is reputable?

    online information can be. Validating volunteered information is not easy. Even
    though Wikipedia is filled with interesting information and its popularity drove
    the final nail in the coffin of hard copy encyclopaedias, it is impossible to
    fully validate its contents. Indeed, in March 2016, an anonymous user accessed
    the editing function in Wikipedia to alter the definition of blockchain to remove
    the words ‘bitcoin’ and ‘permissionless’ [331]. Although it is accepted that blockchain
    networks are not necessarily permissionless and do not have to tokenise value
    or assets like bitcoin, this tampering with definitions was regarded as vexatious
    enough to see the revocation of the culprit’s Wikipedia editing rights. Bitcoin
    and blockchain enthusiasts took to Twitter in response, expressing their concern
    that this was a deliberate effort to use the forum as a vehicle to push an agenda.
    Keeping Wikipedia free of political or commercial interests is key to ensuring
    its reputation as a reliable source of objective facts and information. Wikipedia
    is just one (albeit significant) website of ‘facts’.

    groups. There is a groundswell of interest in the protection of the integrity
    of online information, particularly when facts and analysis are intended to inform
    democratic processes. The blockchain can do for news and other social media what
    it has done for bitcoin and Veritas—allow the community to curate, police, and
    censor its content [332].

    a plethora of problems that content creators face, no matter how secure or professional
    the sites may be. Almost any content creator has experienced their content being
    copied or ripped by others, without their consent. In addition, since the start
    of Trump’s presidency, fake news is, unfortunately, the new normal. According
    to Bloomberg Businessweek, even medical journals are now experiencing problems
    with fake news [333]. The open-access system of allowing the internet to distribute
    high-quality research to a wider audience has allowed unreliable content into
    the mix.

    spam is extremely cheap to send out, which means only a few individuals out of
    millions have to be taken in to make it worth sending. For the last few years,
    the best methods to fight spam have been to attempt to legally shut down spammers
    and create better spam filters. However, now there is a new solution that could
    dramatically limit the possibility of sending spam.

- en: Blockchain can limit or prevent spam by creating email networks with individual
    nodes rather than centralised servers. A system will be guarded against attacks
    by using blockchain when receiving or sending emails. The system is protected
    and not open to spam on any individual node. There are even methods available
    for nodes to receive tokens in the network, similar to how Bitcoin operates. Users
    can ultimately get fair compensation for receiving only legitimate content. Another
    option to prevent spam is the application of a reputation mechanism when creating
    content. Users who send spam will need to pay a very small amount for each email
    sent, but when you are sending millions of emails it can become expensive very
    quickly.

    using it without giving you credit. ‘Proof of Existence’ is an online service
    that incorporates blockchain. It involves content being certified and time stamped
    into the blockchain, providing a cryptographic record. It is a public record proving
    that you own the content without actually revealing the information or yourself.
    When you add the metadata of the content on the blockchain as well, it becomes
    possible to prove at any time that you were the original creator. These aspects
    of blockchain will lead to increased accuracy and overall confidence in online
    content.

    freedom of expression. It is a fundamental human right. Without freedom of press
    and support for information integrity, development in countries that struggle
    to house, educate, and feed vulnerable people cannot happen. Freedom of expression

    in the troubled streets of Caracas. In Venezuela, the media have been under immense
    pressure for years, first under Hugo Chávez and now from the Maduro administration
    [329, 335]. Venezuelans describe their daily lives as confused and exhausted.
    A recent alleged attempted coup by a lone helicopter pilot dropping grenades was
    reported by some to be a government conspiracy—manipulated by Maduro to justify
    government oppression [336]. Conspiracy theories were fuelled by conflicting reports
    that the perpetrator was either ex-special forces or an aspiring actor, or both.
    Revelations of fake news about threats to the government and deaths of activists,
    and rumours that the first family is fleeing the country [337], and the military
    is mobilising against Maduro [338], only make a bad situation worse. As it is
    difficult to distinguish fact from fiction, Venezuelans say they are unable to
    make decisions [339].

    are addressed soon [340]. In this context, separating fact from fiction has never
    been so important for decision-making. The fake news in Venezuela comes from a
    variety of sources, many of them unidentified, most of them with vested interests
    in the current conflict [335]. However, blockchain technology can offer secure
    social networks and verified journalism, protecting not just content, but also
    its creators.
