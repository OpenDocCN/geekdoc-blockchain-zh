    blockchain. The first step is to determine whether existing legacy solutions are
    unsatisfactory and need replacing. If so, firms need to assess whether blockchain
    is the answer. Then, they should map out the business case for developing blockchain-based
    solutions to gain support and resources (capital, personnel, time, etc.) to develop
    and test the project. This leads to designing the blockchain solution, which should
    capitalize on blockchain’s unique features and capabilities. The last step is
    preparing the organization to work with blockchain so that managers, technologists,
    and other employees unite to become successful with it.

    be little need to move to a blockchain-based solution. Before blockchains, firms
    used centralized databases to secure data and control access. The centralized
    firm controlled subordinate units and managed suppliers. A control tower or dashboard
    that summarized updated, timely information with exception reporting on key metrics
    has served top management and key decision-makers well in the past and may be
    still serviceable—at least for as long as the firm continues to operate hierarchically,
    to dominate its hierarchy, and can rely on its own data for sound long-term decision-making.

    only as strong as its weakest link, which is equally true of blockchains. If one
    node has performance, scale or security problems, they can impact the other nodes.
    A blockchain can be a powerful solution, but organizations should use it only
    when they have challenges that aren’t addressed well by existing technology.”[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en269)
    It is when industry structure changes so that the firm has to collaborate to satisfy
    customers—and needs accurate, timely data from independent parties—that blockchain
    becomes attractive. I have previously referred to the credit scoring industry,
    with three dominant firms in the US market, including Equifax. And as noted, centrally
    controlled deep repositories, as at Equifax, can and have been hacked, creating
    considerable collateral damage to customers. In such circumstances, blockchain-based
    decentralized creditworthiness determination, with individuals in control of their
    credit data, is the disruptive innovation with long-term potential.

    equipment readiness and usage would help forecast and detect imminent equipment
    breakdown. It could also launch preemptive parts requests and preventive maintenance
    steps, including timely ordering and positioning of key spare parts at the relevant
    site. Enterprises moving to blockchain might still need to combine legacy solutions
    with blockchain, as an intermediate stage, with blockchain complementing legacy
    solutions. For example, Santander Bank was an early adopter of Ripple to lower
    cross-border remittance costs for its customers but still had to continue using
    legacy remittance transfer systems. Some customers did not or were not able to

    Furthermore, data storage within a blockchain is costly, rendering it uneconomic

    to lead and build blockchain applications. Firms can decide that existing technologies

    such as Barclays, Citi, DB, UBS, and JPMorgan to move record keeping, life cycle
    events, payments, and settlement of credit default swaps to the blockchain platform,
    yielding a single set of records for regulators and counterparties.[12](14085-0014.xhtml#en280)
    The project was then extended to additional DTCC clients but with permissioned
    access. Controlling access leads to faster validation of transactions and greater
    data privacy. Further, a limited number of nodes can more easily agree on common
    data standards and governance as in this case of credit derivatives. The downside
    is that fewer nodes result in less robust security. It is likely that enterprise
    platforms will evolve in the direction of public permissionless blockchains as
    scalability, speed, privacy, and finality questions are resolved. Also, private

    of use, on desktops, tablets, and smartphones, makes users reluctant to learn
    new interfaces and expect new applications to offer similar convenience and ease
    of use. Potential users may reject blockchain because they find it difficult,
    find the interface to be unfriendly, and are unfamiliar with the technology, which
    then limits adoption. Blockchains are unfamiliar to most users; their interfaces
    have yet to match the ease of use and transparency of legacy applications.

    to use both public and private keys in ensuring identity and gaining access to
    the blockchain. Secure private key storage and retrieval is essential to the continued
    access and use of blockchain applications, and novice users can unintentionally
    mislay or give access to their private key to ill-intentioned actors and thus
    be denied access to the applications and possibly lose assets and information.
    Blockchain user interfaces can be improved by involving subsets of potential users
    while the application and interface are being designed—“participatory design.”[22](14085-0014.xhtml#en290)

    in the introduction, cross-border remittances incur high fees, costing 6–7 percent
    of transfer amounts, and can take several days and be opaque, with clients unable
    to ascertain when the transaction would be completed or the exchange rate used
    for conversion. Blockchain applications aim to resolve these problems, with the
    goal of faster fulfillment, lower costs, and greater transparency. However, implementing
    successful cross-border remittance applications needs timely cooperation from
    multiple governments, whose jurisdictions are involved in cross-border money transfers.
    Governments have to be persuaded to collaborate with each other and accept harmonized
    cross-national regulations. And enterprises and their banks must work alongside
    central banks, regulators, and payments infrastructure operators, in a slow and
    sometimes bureaucratic process, to arrive at a satisfactory solution.[24](14085-0014.xhtml#en292)

    Another example of the impact of regulatory uncertainty is the debate over the
    fiduciary role and responsibility of blockchain programmers and project leaders.[27](14085-0014.xhtml#en295)
    The debate is whether or not developers of blockchain networks maintain a governance
    role that should have a fiduciary obligation toward the network’s digital asset

    intermediary, undertakes the search for alternative accommodation. In a blockchain,
    with decentralized nodes, immediate accountability and make-whole response may
    be lacking. A smart contract may not provide similar accountability for inadequate
    performance. It can provide for repayment and possible adjudication in case of
    nonperformance, but damages incurred from nonperformance or defective performance
    would have to be awarded by a court. The judicial system in force would need to
    decide whether smart contracts are legally enforceable. Thus, a smart contract
    cannot easily substitute for the legal system and for commonsense judgment of
    “reasonable care” or “good faith.”[28](14085-0014.xhtml#en296) Enterprises also
    must contend with flaws in reporting or misrepresentation of off-chain events

    a supervisory node needed access to all transaction details, while counterparties
    specific to a transaction were restricted via dedicated channels to their interactions
    alone. The Fed wanted to determine scalability limitations when using blockchain
    since a rising number of such transactions, each with a set of counterparties,
    implied a continually increasing number of dedicated channels and possible deterioration
    in performance. Such side channels, with the relevant counterparties in full control

    blockchain features to craft its disruptive application and offer customers advantages
    over the existing SWIFT messaging system–based legacy alternative. Ripple, unlike
    Bitcoin, departed from a fully decentralized network and restricted validation
    to a few trusted validator nodes, the UNL. This leads to faster processing and
    settlement. However, relying on a few trusted nodes makes RippleNet vulnerable
    to a single point of failure, that is, Ripple itself. Further, Ripple does not
    mint XRP using Bitcoin’s slower and energy-intensive PoW approach. Instead, it
    premined XRP, creating one hundred billion XRP at the firm’s outset in 2012, and
    released (gifted) eighty billion XRP to the Ripple company for use in funding
    its operations (the founders kept twenty billion XRP as their share).[32](14085-0014.xhtml#en300)

    finality. It relied on blockchain’s ability to continuously update the ledger
    with transaction state and account balances to offer clients immutability and
    a timestamped audit trail. And as XRP use grows, network effects could persuade
    clients to use the Ripple network over the incumbent SWIFT solution. This would
