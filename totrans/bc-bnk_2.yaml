    and a key source of innovation in financial markets in the future and that it
    could revolutionise our society and the new world economy. Since its start as
    the technology underlying Bitcoin and its use in recording cryptocurrency transactions,
    blockchain has become a technology that can both facilitate the process of recording
    any transaction type and track the movement of any asset. Its application is widespread
    and in different areas.

- en: Blockchain is a digital, decentralised and distributed ledger that is constantly
    updated. This technology makes it possible to record transactions and track assets
    in a given network (Swan [2015](#CR52); Crosby et al. [2016](#CR12); Walport [2016](#CR58)).
    The word “blockchain” comes from the transactions being grouped into “blocks”
    (as a data package), which are linked to the blocks that precede them to form
    a chronological “chain” of blocks. This blockchain provides a trail of the underlying
    transaction and, thus, represents a complete ledger of the transaction history
    (Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR27); Nofer et al. [2017](#CR45)). However, unlike traditional
    ledgers, blockchain combines several computer technologies, including a digital
    ledger, distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms
    and encryption algorithms (Guo and Liang [2016](#CR26); Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR27);
    Lewis et al. [2017](#CR34)), which offer potential advantages in terms of cost,
    speed and data integrity. In particular, it is possible to identify some key features
    that underlie blockchain and make it a disruptive technology (Bohme et al. [2015](#CR5);
    Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR31); Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR56); Zheng
    et al. [2017](#CR63); Martino et al. [2019](#CR39)).

- en: First, blockchain is a “distributed ledger” of a network’s participants, and
    all the participants have permission to access it. “Distributed” means that every
    participant can share a ledger that is updated every time a transaction occurs
    and has simultaneous access to view the information^([1](#Fn1)) (Natarajan et
    al. [2017](#CR43)). Thus, transparency is assured in blockchain as the complete
    transaction history is stored by all the participants on a network and is visible
    to anyone with access to the system (Fanning and Centers [2016](#CR20); Iansiti
    and Lakhani [2017](#CR31)). At the same time, it is also “decentralised” because
    no individual node can fully control the entire network (Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR31);
    Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR56)). Hence, no central authority is required
    as control over the ledger is given to all the network participants. The decentralised
    storage in blockchain also ensures high robustness by eliminating a single point
    of failure, which is typical of centralised systems (Fanning and Centers [2016](#CR20)).
    Indeed, if there is a failure in any node, the other nodes will continue to operate,
    thereby maintaining the system’s availability.

    without a central point of authority or control (Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR31);
    Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR56)). This allows for decentralised transaction
    processing, meaning that everyone can directly send something to anyone else in
    a given network, thus removing the need for a central authority to verify trust
    and to transfer something of value.

- en: Third, as mentioned above, in the blockchain, transactions are grouped in blocks
    that are linked to the blocks that precede them, and this chronological chain
    of blocks provides a trail of the underlying transactions. These blocks are “cryptographically”
    sealed in the chain using hash functions, a type of cryptography system that converts
    an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a fixed length (i.e.
    the “hash”), which cannot be inverted to recover the original input (Narayanan
    et al. [2016](#CR42); Yermack [2017](#CR61)). Specifically, as shown in Fig. [2.1](#Fig1),
    in addition to the information on the transaction, each block contains the *hash
    value*^([2](#Fn2)) (i.e. a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies
    data) of the preceding block (parent), a *timestamp* that records the temporal
    existence of a particular blockchain ledger item at a given instance in time and
    a *nonce*, which is a random number used to verify the hash (Nomura Research Institute
    [NRI] [2016](#CR46); Nofer et al. [2017](#CR45); Zheng et al. [2018](#CR62)).![../images/490216_1_En_2_Chapter/490216_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/490216_1_En_2_Chapter/490216_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png)

    a hash function that reflects the contents of the previous block, which itself
    includes a hash function derived from its predecessor and so on—all the way back
    to the first block in the chain (Yermack [2017](#CR61)). Furthermore, a block’s
    transactions are hashed through the *Merkle root*, that is, the hash of all the
    hashes of all the transactions that are part of a block in a blockchain network
    (Martino et al. [2019](#CR39)). This means that the integrity and security of
    the information on the blockchain are ensured via cryptographic functions; this
    ensures the irreversibility of records and, consequently, high robustness and
    high trust since it is impossible to delete or edit these blocks (Iansiti and
    Lakhani [2017](#CR31); Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR56); Adhami et al. [2018](#CR1)).'

- en: 'Blockchain also makes use of “asymmetric cryptography” mechanisms (i.e. public-key
    cryptography) to validate the authentication of transactions. This helps users
    to protect their digital property and enhance user security by using different
    keys for encryption and decryption: one for private use—i.e. a *private key*—and
    one available to anyone—i.e. a *public key* (NRI [2016](#CR46); Zheng et al. [2018](#CR62)).
    While a public key represents an individual’s account address, which can be seen
    by anyone, a private key restricts access to account ownership to the private
    key/account holder.^([3](#Fn3)) The private —and public-key pairs allow people
    to encrypt the information that will be sent, thus enabling the receiver to determine
    whether the message originated with the right person and whether there has been
    any tampering (Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR49)). Thus, delivery and receipt of
    information can be done safely, since it is nearly impossible to derive a private
    key from its paired public key alone. Furthermore, when an account holder authorises
    a transaction, a “digital signature” is created through a mathematical algorithm.
    This signature combines users’ private key with the data that they would like
    to transfer and is used to prove the authenticity of the data being sent. It is
    made by encrypting the hash value of the data to be sent with the sender’s private
    key and is sent to the receiver together with these data. After receiving the
    data with the digital signature, the receiver uses the same hash function as the
    sender to generate the data’s hash value and cross-checks the created hash value
    with the hash value obtained by decrypting the sender’s digital signature with
    the sender’s public key, thereby confirming the authenticity of the digital signature
    (NRI [2016](#CR46); Drescher [2017](#CR14)).'

- en: Finally, another key characteristic of blockchain is that it is “consensus-based”,
    that is, a transaction can be recorded only if all the participants in the network
    approve it (Lewis et al. [2017](#CR34)). Swanson ([2015](#CR53)) defines the consensus
    mechanism as the process by which a majority (or, in some cases, all) of the network
    validators agree on the state of a ledger. According to him, “it is a set of rules
    and procedures that allows maintaining a coherent set of facts between multiple
    participating nodes”. This means that a new block can be added to the chain when
    the majority of nodes in the network agree via a consensus mechanism on the validity
    of transactions in a block and on the validity of the block itself^([4](#Fn4))
    (Nofer et al. [2017](#CR45)). Once validated, the new block is added to the blockchain,
    which essentially results in an update of the transaction ledger distributed across
    the network. Hence, in this system, every transaction is recorded in the ledger
    only after a verification process that ensures the transaction’s validity, thus
    making blockchain a mechanism that ensures transparency and trust (Buitenhek [2016](#CR6);
    Crosby et al. [2016](#CR12)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several approaches to reach consensus in the blockchain, each of which
    has different advantages and disadvantages. The first and most popular blockchain
    consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW), which is used in the Bitcoin network.
    In a PoW system, network participants have to solve a complex mathematical problem
    before they are allowed to add new “blocks” to the blockchain. They have to calculate
    the hash value of the changing block header by using a random number (a nonce)
    until they achieve a value equal to or less than a specified target^([5](#Fn5))
    (Zheng et al. [2018](#CR62)). When the relevant value is achieved, network participants
    should mutually confirm the correctness of the value; if the majority of participants
    agree on it, the new block is considered valid and is added to the existing chain.
    The miner who produces a valid PoW may receive cryptocurrency as a reward (e.g.
    in the form of a transaction fee), which serves as an economic incentive to maintain
    system integrity (Natarajan et al. [2017](#CR43)). It should be noted that, since
    the difficulty level of mining increases over time as more blocks are solved,
    the PoW mechanism requires a vast amount of computing resources, which entails
    high electricity costs and, consequently, high costs for the miner (Houben and
    Snyers [2018](#CR28)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second-best-known and most commonly used consensus mechanism is the Proof
    of Stake (PoS), which represents an energy-saving alternative to PoW where miners
    have to prove the ownership of the amount of currency (in the case of cryptocurrencies)
    to participate in the validation of transactions^([6](#Fn6)) (Houben and Snyers
    [2018](#CR28); Zheng et al. [2018](#CR62)). While PoW depends on “computing power”
    to mine blocks, PoS depends on a node’s “stake” in the system—typically, the amount
    of currency a user holds. This means a transaction validator will have to prove
    their “stake” (i.e. their share) of all coins in existence before they are allowed
    to validate a transaction. As a result, the greater the user’s stake is, the more
    authority they have over validation, since they have greater seniority within
    the network, which earns them a more trusted position (Natarajan et al. [2017](#CR43);
    Houben and Snyers [2018](#CR28)). An evolution of PoS is the Delegated Proof of
    Stake (DPoS), where the miners’ ability to validate a block depends on their stake
    but, unlike with PoS, stakeholders (based on their stake) elect a group of delegated
    witnesses who generate and validate blocks (Li et al. [2017](#CR35); Zheng et
    al. [2018](#CR62)).

    systems. Such systems are expensive, duplicate efforts, require long times and
    have many problems, especially regarding trust—i.e. they require third-party verification
    (MacDonald et al. [2016](#CR36)). The actors sharing a database have to trust
    a central authority, which controls a master copy, to keep the records accurate
    and maintain the technological infrastructure necessary to prevent data loss in
    case of equipment failure or cyberattacks. Accordingly, centralised systems are
    also vulnerable, since the central authority represents a single point of failure
    (Lewis et al. [2017](#CR34)); this means that if the central authority’s technological
    infrastructure is compromised, the database is lost, which would affect the entire

- en: Depending on the nature of the ledger, blockchain can be classified into three
    categories, namely *public*, *private* and *hybrid* blockchains, each of which
    has its own characteristics in terms of consensus determination, read permission
    and degree of decentralisation (Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR49); Natarajan et
    al. [2017](#CR43); Zheng et al. [2018](#CR62); Martino et al. [2019](#CR39)).

- en: Public (also called *permissionless*) blockchains are completely decentralised
    and have no single owner. Moreover, approval by a central entity is not required
    to join the network. Hence, any network participant may have access to information
    in and make transactions on the blockchain, as well as take part in the consensus
    process. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the best-known examples of a public blockchain.
    Conversely, in fully private (also called *permissioned*) blockchains, a single
    entity, as owner or administrator of the ledger, sets the rules for the blockchain
    (Natarajan et al. [2017](#CR43)), has ownership, controls the whole blockchain
    (thus, it determines the final consensus) and designates who can participate in
    the network and in what capacity. Therefore, only permission holders (e.g. users
    within an organisation, or a group of organisations) can operate on the blockchain,
    since prior authorisation from a centralised authority is required to participate
    in the network (Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR49)). Examples of permissioned blockchain
    are Ripple and Corda (the latter was created by R3, a consortium of over 70 financial
    institutions). Generally, while *public* blockchains are those in which cryptocurrencies
    operate, private blockchains are used for specific usage cases, such as applications
    in the financial sector. It is also worth noting that private blockchains can
    overcome some of the drawbacks of blockchain discussed in the previous paragraph.
    In particular, by limiting the number of participants and the scope of consensus,
    which requires lower costs and computational power to work than public blockchains,
    private blockchains can achieve better scalability and processing speed and, consequently,
    ensure more efficiency (Martino [2019](#CR37)). Moreover, since a private blockchain
    is a closed system between predefined participants, it does not suffer from the
    regulatory issues (e.g. privacy concerns) faced by public blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Between the two extremes (public and private blockchains), a third classification
    that combines the two models is the hybrid (or *consortium*) blockchain, where
    the consensus process is controlled by a preselected set of nodes (Peters and
    Panayi [2016](#CR49)). Specifically, part of the network has the characteristic
    of being public (i.e. accessible to any participant), but only a privileged group
    is responsible for the consensus process. Thus, they are partially decentralised
    as the blockchain is only distributed among entitled participants.

    schemes and payments, its scope is much wider: today, blockchain’s distributed
    ledger technology can facilitate the recording of any transaction type and can
    track the movement of any asset, whether tangible, intangible or digital, and
    can be applied in multiple areas (Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR56)). Depending

    operates and that allows the recording of transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
    Conversely, Blockchain 2.0 refers to the wide range of economic and financial
    applications beyond currency and simple payments (Efanov and Roschin [2018](#CR16)).
    According to Swan ([2015](#CR52)), while Blockchain 1.0 is for the decentralisation
    of money and payments, Blockchain 2.0 is for the decentralisation of markets more
    generally and contemplates the transfer of many other kinds of assets beyond currency
    using blockchain. Applications in this fields include traditional banking instruments
    such as loans and mortgages, complex financial market instruments such as stocks,

    example of Blockchain 2.0 is Ethereum, an open-source blockchain platform that
    allows developers to write smart contracts and decentralised applications (Dapps).
    These Dapps run on a network in a distributed manner with participant information

    gains, reducing tax evasion and so forth. At the same time, however, the emergence
    of new technologies gives rise to new issues related to fraud, money laundering,
    terrorism financing and cybercrime, which must be addressed. The rise of Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies has added fuel to the discussion, given their potential
    to disrupt existing payment and monetary systems (Bohme et al. [2015](#CR5)).

- en: Cryptocurrencies, which represent the pioneering application of blockchain technology,
    are digital financial assets (digital currencies) designed to work as a medium
    of exchange that uses cryptography, rather than a bank or other trusted third
    party (government or other central authority), to secure financial transactions,
    control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets (Yermack
    [2013](#CR60); European Payment Council [2019](#CR18); Giudici et al. [2020](#CR25)).^([10](#Fn10))
    They use decentralised control instead of centralised digital currency and central
    banking systems (Bohme et al. [2015](#CR5); Richter et al. [2015](#CR50); Jacobs
    [2018](#CR32)). In particular, in contrast to traditional fiat currencies, which
    require a central trusted party (e.g. the central bank) to guarantee the value
    of national currencies and transactions, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technologies
    to create a distributed system of certification and integrity on the Internet
    for payment transactions, thereby eliminating the need for a central authority
    (Adhami et al. [2018](#CR1)).

    in 2008 when an individual or group of developers using the pseudonym Satoshi
    Nakamoto drafted a whitepaper to propose the creation of a peer-to-peer electronic
    cash system (i.e. Bitcoin) whose purpose would be to allow online payments to
    be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution
    (Nakamoto [2008](#CR41)). The idea was to create an electronic payment system
    based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, which allows anyone to transact
    and transfer value directly to another party without the need for a trusted third
    party such as banks, thus solving the issue of needing a third party when making
    a payment.^([11](#Fn11))

    the number of new currencies, as well as the consumer base and the transaction
    frequency (Dyhrberg [2016](#CR15)). As reported in the Payment Methods Report
    (2019) by the European Payments Council, the number of payments made by using
    cryptocurrencies is constantly on the rise, with several companies (Microsoft
    and Expedia, among others) accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and others
    allowing customers to make Bitcoin payments via crypto payment gateways such as
    BitPay. The potential of cryptocurrencies, which can explain their current economic
    value, is substantial and linked particularly to the fact that they may ease financial
    transactions by providing more flexibility and speed in international transfer
    than other currencies managed by banks (Dyhrberg [2016](#CR15)). As the main determinant
    of the value of cryptocurrencies, literature points to: the high speed and low
    cost of transactions because of the elimination of intermediaries, for example;
    greater accessibility to everyone connected to the Internet, which fosters financial
    inclusion for unbanked and underbanked populations (the former are people without
    a bank account; the latter are people with limited access to traditional banking
    services and products); and greater privacy, which guarantees anonymity and security
    when making payments (Richter et al. [2015](#CR50); Jacobs [2018](#CR32); Giudici

    problems) and high volatility (Ciaian et al. [2016](#CR10))—that currently limit
    the potential for broad adoption in day-to-day payments (UBS [2018](#CR57)). Hence,
    cryptocurrencies have to compete with other systems in terms of costs, speed and
    scalability. For example, new transaction technologies (such as SEPA Instant Credit
    Transfer) and fund transfer systems (such as Transferwise) make it possible to
    reduce costs and time in money transfer (the Instant scheme allows pan-European
    credit transfers, with the funds made available in less than 10 seconds). The
    security and privacy of cryptocurrencies have also been a topic of discussion.
    With respect to security issues, cryptocurrencies may be subject to theft and
    hacker attacks (e.g. if someone stole the user’s private key and could then tamper
    with the user’s account). Regarding privacy issues, Bohme et al. ([2015](#CR5))
    note that Bitcoin transactions are not truly anonymous but pseudonymous, given
    that each transaction specifies account information (i.e. the user’s public key),
    albeit without personal names, and the blockchain publishes transactions with
    that user identifier. According to them, a Bitcoin user’s identity could be obtained
    by exploiting such information (see also De Filippi [2016](#CR13)).

    [2018](#CR32)). The anonymity (or pseudonymity) and lack of regulation associated
    with cryptocurrencies have raised serious concerns, particularly regarding the
    use of cryptocurrencies for fraud, hacking, money laundering, terrorism financing
    and tax evasion (Bohme et al. [2015](#CR5); Richter et al. [2015](#CR50); Houben
    and Snyers [2018](#CR28)), among others. Regulators around the world are worried
    about criminals increasingly using cryptocurrencies for illicit activities. The
    rules of cryptocurrency exchange may change in the future because of the authorities’
    intervention in response to the problems above (Martino et al. [2019](#CR39)).

    financing for new start-ups, especially for blockchain-based organisations (Frame
    et al. [2018](#CR22); Martino et al. [2019](#CR39)). Specifically, the ICOs mechanism
    represents a new fundraising model based on blockchain technology and related
    cryptocurrencies. It works similarly to crowdfunding but sells instruments of
    a different nature (tokens) and uses blockchain technology for verification instead
    of a crowdfunding platform^([15](#Fn15)) (Arnold et al. [2019](#CR2); Fisch [2019](#CR21)).

    angel investors and crowdfunding) because they offer several advantages for new
    ventures, as well as investors. A large number of companies and individuals are
    using ICOs more and more as a way to raise capital or participate in investment
    opportunities^([16](#Fn16)) (SEC [2017](#CR51)). As literature (e.g. Tapscott

    thanks to the key characteristics of blockchain technology, ICOs may enable new
    ventures to collect a large number of financial contributions from a significant
    number of investors across the world in a faster, more flexible way and at a lower
    cost than other traditional funding mechanisms such as crowdfunding. Moreover,
    they provide advantages for potential investors by reducing entry barriers to
    participate financially in successful start-ups, meaning that anyone (including
    small investors) can invest any amount in a company. However, ICOs do have some
    potentially risky shortcomings. Flaws in the blockchain technology can be subject
    to cyberattacks, and the lack of regulation can make investors vulnerable to fraud
    or increase illicit activities (Martino et al. [2020](#CR38)).^([17](#Fn17))

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A further key application of blockchain technology is *smart contracts*, that
    is, “computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract”
    according to computer scientist and cryptographer Nick Szabo, who first introduced
    the concept in 1994\. The idea that he proposed was to translate contractual clauses
    into code and embed them in hardware or software that can self-enforce them (i.e.
    satisfy common contractual conditions) to minimise both the need for trusted intermediaries
    between transacting parties and the occurrence of malicious or accidental exceptions
    (Szabo [1994](#CR54), [1997](#CR55)). Thus, they fundamentally represent contracts
    written in computer code that execute automatically once certain conditions specified
    in the contract are met^([18](#Fn18)) (Lewis et al. [2017](#CR34)). There is currently
    no established definition for smart contracts, and their official legal status
    remains somewhat unclear (Lauslahti et al. [2017](#CR33)). For instance, Lauslahti
    et al. ([2017](#CR33), p. 11) define smart contracts as “digital programs, based
    on the blockchain consensus architecture, which will self-execute when the terms
    of the agreement are met, and due to their decentralised structure are also self-enforcing
    and tamper-proof”. In the same vein, Cong and He ([2019](#CR11), p. 1761) define
    smart contracts as “digital contracts allowing terms contingent on decentralized
    consensus that are tamper-proof and typically self-enforcing through automated
    execution”.

- en: Although the idea of smart contracts was developed in the 1990s, it was only
    with the emergence of blockchain technology that they became more popular. This
    is because blockchain can facilitate the execution of smart contracts better than
    the technology available at the time of their invention, since blockchain’s distributed
    ledger technology makes it possible to host and automatically execute contracts
    using cryptography without the involvement of third parties (e.g. notaries, lawyers,
    etc.)^([19](#Fn19)) (Fairfield [2014](#CR19); Nofer et al. [2017](#CR45); Gatteschi
    et al. [2018](#CR23); Giudici and Adhami [2019](#CR24)). Specifically, blockchain
    allows code to be embedded in the distributed ledger, thus making the contract
    tamper-resistant, and once specific predefined conditions are met, the contract
    self-executes automatically without the need for third parties to enforce the
    agreements between the parties, since neither party can tamper with the code (Wang
    et al. [2019](#CR59)).

    [2017](#CR47); Cong and He [2019](#CR11)) believe that blockchain may disrupt
    the entire transaction process and can be expected to potentially affect traditional
    business as well, since smart contracts may allow the automation of processes
    that currently require manual intervention: specifically, they can enable the
    automatic execution of commercial transactions and agreements in a cost-efficient,
    transparent and secure way, in real time and without the involvement of a third
    party. As studies (Yermack [2017](#CR61); Cong and He [2019](#CR11)) suggest,
    the potential applications of smart contracts are broad, particularly for the
    financial services industry. For instance, Cong and He ([2019](#CR11)) claim that
    smart contracts can increase contractibility and facilitate the exchange of money,
    property, shares, service or anything of value in an algorithmically automated
    way. Other studies (e.g. Capgemini [2016](#CR8); Lewis et al. [2017](#CR34)) suggest
    that smart contracts may allow the automation of processes that currently require
    manual interventions and rely on physical documents; these processes are characterised
    by delays, inefficiencies and increased exposure to errors and fraud. According
    to a report by Capgemini ([2016](#CR8)), the adoption of smart contracts could
    reduce risks, lower administration and service costs and provide more efficient
    business processes across all major segments of the financial services industry.
    For instance, its estimates suggest that mortgage borrowers in the US and European
    markets could potentially save between $480 and $960 per loan, and banks would
    be able to reduce costs in the range of $3 billion to $11 billion annually by
    lowering processing costs in the mortgage origination process. Other relevant
    areas for financial institutions, where the use of smart contracts can reduce
    the manual effort required to support the execution of economic transactions and,
    thus, accelerate business processes, include global payments, syndicated credit,
    cross-border settlement and trade finance, as well as regulatory and compliance
    activities (Swanson [2015](#CR53); Capgemini [2016](#CR8); Cong and He [2019](#CR11)).'

- en: Despite their numerous potentials mentioned above, smart contracts also pose
    several challenges that need to be tackled before they can reach widespread adoption
    (Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR49)). In addition to technical vulnerabilities, the
    use of smart contracts raises many legal and regulatory issues (Yermack [2017](#CR61);
    Natarajan et al. [2017](#CR43)). First, smart contracts are vulnerable and may
    be subject to cyberattacks since they cannot be modified (the most relevant case
    of a smart contract-based attack is The DAO) (Gatteschi et al. [2018](#CR23)).
    In the hypothesis that a smart contract contains a bug, once the contract is stored
    on the blockchain, it can no longer be modified given the immutable nature of
    the blockchain, which means that there is no direct way to fix the bug (Atzei
    et al. [2017](#CR3)). As Gatteschi et al. ([2018](#CR23)) suggest, developers
    should create a new contract and transfer all data and pointers from the old to
    the new ones in order to remove code bugs. Second, the lack of standards and regulations
    raises a number of legal and regulatory issues, particularly with regard to liability,
    jurisdiction, amendments and the voidability of contracts, as well as consequent
    concerns about the degree to which smart contracts can legally substitute paper
    agreements (Natarajan et al. [2017](#CR43); Giudici and Adhami [2019](#CR24)).
    For instance, the immutability of smart contracts (i.e. they cannot be changed
    after they are deployed) may generate problems if external conditions change,
    such as changes to the law, applicable regulations and so forth, which would require
    a change in the smart contract, or if some event has a legal impact on the rights
    and obligations of the parties to the smart contract. Other problems may result
    from situations in which a court does not consider the outcome of a smart contract
    legal under existing law (Gatteschi et al. [2018](#CR23)). Hence, numerous technical
    and legal issues must be addressed to make smart contracts interoperate with the
    existing legal system (Lauslahti et al. [2017](#CR33)).
