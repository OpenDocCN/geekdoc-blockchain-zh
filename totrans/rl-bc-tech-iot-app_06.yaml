- en: The promise of blockchain extends into healthcare allowing a transformation
    of our current system and its use of information technology. The current use of
    information technology in healthcare can be advanced with blockchain. The fundamental
    values that blockchain will bring include decentralization due to its distributed
    ledger technology, interoperability and increased security and immutability. These
    benefits enable a healthcare system that is integrated, seamless and more secure
    and with an increased level of compliance. Blockchains offer the opportunity to
    deliver secure and highly efficient transaction processing between patient, provider
    and payer and other healthcare parties in a more efficient and seamless way. The
    use of smart contracts in healthcare is the catalyst by which blockchains can
    deliver these transactions in a transformative way. The application of blockchains
    combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) is also a catalyst that will enable
    these transactions to be processed to disrupt healthcare from its current state
    at this time. We explore ways that blockchain and its associated information technology
    will revolutionize our healthcare system that we believe would allow for a more
    efficient and fluid environment with improved cost efficiencies.

    use of health information technology and the associated hardware and software
    infrastructure. The underlying technology and associated cryptocurrency with its
    decentralized architecture suggests a range of applications that can, we argue,
    bring cost savings and efficiencies versus traditional legacy systems currently
    in use in not only the public healthcare space but also in associated private
    market participants. We suggest that there are numerous applications that can
    be implemented in public programs in the US healthcare system using blockchain
    technology.

    (IT) architecture and its “unbreakable” chain of data entries that allow for secure
    and open transactions. The decentralized and distributed database of a blockchain
    that contains data allows for an auditable and distributed ledger that allows
    all to see every transaction. The open source attributes of the blockchain make
    the technology a natural fit for the requirements associated with the complexities
    of transaction laden systems associated with health information technology in
    the public and private sector.

    both the US Medicaid and Medicare systems that could benefit from the deployment
    of blockchain applications by replacing expensive hardware and software IT systems
    with a blockchain infrastructure. The Medicaid program spent $553 Billion in Federal
    Fiscal Year 2016 with that amount predicted to grow at 5–8% or more per year [[1]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0010).
    Administrative costs of the Medicaid program are estimated at 5–6% of total spend
    or nearly $30 Billion, which includes costs associated with health information
    technology deployment and maintenance [[2]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0015). In
    addition, we argue that the potential cost savings would be significant versus
    current costs and ongoing system maintenance of existing legacy IT systems. Blockchain
    is relatively easier to program and to implement system wide changes in comparison
    to changes made to legacy IT systems.

    the privacy and data security concerns associated with healthcare that are inherent
    in any health IT system. Finally, we also examine the policy implications of deploying
    blockchain technology and suggest further areas of research.

    Bitcoin as a digital cryptocurrency [[3]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0020). While
    the rise of digital only currencies in recent years has captured the attention
    of the financial industry, the public, and regulators it remains largely unknown
    to the general public. The technology that helped to launch Bitcoin or “blockchain”
    is of particular interest and potential use to a wide range of industries, including
    healthcare because of the open source and decentralized nature of the technology.

    ledger. This consists of unbreakable chains that allow for secure and open transactions.
    These transactions are open for all to see, which is enabled by the decentralized
    nature of the blockchain [[4]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0025). In addition, transactions
    are secure and immutable; it is impossible to make any changes to the existing
    chains. In healthcare, the advantages of this type of distributed, secure and
    open architecture are clear as they address some of the core inefficiencies that
    are in existence today. One of the main benefits of blockchain is that it allows
    the elimination of a third party between transactions. This means that providers
    can interact directly with patients, for instance, and this type of transaction
    does not necessitate a third party or intermediary. With blockchains, all parties
    are equipped to add to the ledger and no need exists for a central intermediary
    to handle this type of transaction. Moreover, blockchains ensure a high degree
    of security and confidentiality due to the unbreakable nature of the chains. Legacy
    systems in existence today are thus no longer needed with the blockchain framework
    and transactions are performed immediately removing long delays and costs that
    exist with current legacy systems.

    The most common and with the most applicability is the Ethereum blockchain. This
    blockchain framework is comparable to the Bitcoin blockchain that was the first
    development of blockchains in finance for cryptocurrency. Ethereum provides a
    framework to develop smart contracts in contrast to Bitcoin, due to its Turing
    complete capability [[4]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0025). Ethereum blockchains,
    like Bitcoin, are considered public blockchains, as anyone is allowed access to
    the blockchain. An alternative blockchain also popular in healthcare applications
    is IBM's Hyperledger blockchain. This blockchain is developed by the Linux foundation
    [[5]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0030). In addition, Hyperledger is considered
    a permissioned blockchain, which means that only designated parties are allowed
    access to the blockchain, in contrast to the public blockchain which is open to
    all. In healthcare, this type of blockchain design can be useful as it defines
    a defined user base consisting of providers, payers and other affiliated parties
    to only be allowed access in the blockchain. This type of permissioned access
    is conducive within the secure and confidential environment required in healthcare.

    and there are many applications ranging from benefits, administration as well
    as clinical [[6](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0035)–[8](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0045)].
    The basis of most of the applications is the use of smart contracts. These smart
    contracts are designed to adhere to certain rules that the blockchain follows.
    Transactions based on these smart contracts are executed in real time and with
    high degree of security between parties. These transactions are immediate and
    eliminate many of the inefficiencies that are present today in the legacy systems.
    These transactions are also more secure and enable a distributed architecture.
    Various healthcare stakeholders are able to interact in more complex relations
    and including with the patient as well. Integration of the electronic health record
    and other patient data becomes more easily integrated with other aspects of the
    health system, from providers to payers and pharmaceutical companies as well [[9](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0050),[10]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0055).
    In this framework, the patient benefits greatly as they are added themselves as
    parties to the blockchain. This inclusion of the patient in the blockchain allows
    the distributed nature of the blockchain to capture data from the patient and
    enables that data to be integrated with the continuum of the care network. This
    can be revolutionary in our health system as the patient becomes central to the
    care system with this capability. This is further enabled with the strong security
    of blockchains to transmit the information with a high degree of confidentiality.

    Decentralized apps (Dapps). These applications are similar to web applications
    in the realm of the Internet, but with the additional feature of operating on
    a decentralized blockchain network [[4]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0025). Dapps
    have many potential applications in healthcare [[11](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0060),[12]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0065).
    Dapps are also conducive to working with a myriad of IoT technologies to deliver
    information across the healthcare continuum, allowing for a complete transformation
    of our current health system [[13](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0070),[14]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0075).
    We see a way to revolutionize healthcare with an implementation of blockchains,
    ranging from providers, payers and government systems as well. The future of healthcare
    is a more robust and integrated system that is no longer beset by the inefficiencies
    of the past, the result due to the blockchain architecture.

    in how claims or other healthcare transactions are processed between parties.
    Essentially, blockchain could lead to elimination of the third party thus creating
    a more efficient process. The process would use smart contracts across parties
    that would enable automatic adjudication of claims. Enhancing claim adjudication
    in healthcare has the benefit of reduction in the occurrence of claim fraud that
    is currently prevalent [[15]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0080). All players in

    [[17]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0090). Other research finds that Medicaid fraud

    This is crucial for progress in our current health ecosystem which consists of
    a plethora of disparate IT legacy systems that have been amassed over the years
    and that do not communicate well with each other. Blockchain would provide the
    ability to replace these disparate systems with a single system that offers interoperability.
    With the use of smart contracts and fully auditable history, Blockchain would
    enable peer-to-peer interoperability among participants within transactions [16].
    In addition to offering interoperability, blockchain transactions would also have
    the advantage of being cryptographically and irrevocable thus ensuring privacy
    across parties. The patient would be able to designate by whom the data can be
    accessed (and at what level of access) by the use of keys that users would have
    access to (either private or public) [[15]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0080).

    patient (or between provider and payer) would be implemented with the use of smart
    contracts within the blockchain [[20]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0105). Smart
    contracts lead to efficiencies as they enable a reduced number of intermediaries
    that exist today which lead to more streamlined transactions [[21]](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0110).
    These transactions would enable a more holistic view of the patient's record for
    all parties involved and lead to an increase in transparency. Beyond contractual
    transactions, clinical transactions based on electronic health records would also
    occur on the blockchain. This would enable clinicians to have access to different
    components of the patient's data throughout the patient's lifetime with an increase
    in transparency (this access would be controlled so that providers have access
    to data only on a need-to-go basis) [[22](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0115)–[25](S006524581830069X.xhtml#bb0130)].

    and reduce timely coordination among various stakeholders. We suggest that the
    documented issues of duplication, fraud, and overutilization of service are traceable
    to the need for data security and data availability. The centralized nature of
    current systems leads to a limited and narrowly defined views of what data needs
    to be shared by whom to whom and who owns the data. We argue that the data belongs
    to the individual, not the system nor the corporate entities that build the system.
    We believe that a blockchain application environment utilizing smart contracts
    can remove many of the barriers and limitations inherent with centralized technology
    systems.

    have numerous benefits to the healthcare system. We suggest that the impacts would
    include instant eligibility and recognition of the benefits through the use of
    a smart contract. Additionally, a blockchain application could provide an unbreakable
    chain that would allow for individualized care through smart care contracts that
    do not break administrative or clinical systems. We believe that the convergence
    of clinical and administrative systems that can be individualized through a blockchain
    smart contract would reduce the duplication inherent in centralized data silo
    systems.

    naturally require the use of portals that would allow each of the needed systems
    to communicate. As discussed in addressing the use case for records management,
    interoperability becomes a prime challenge. The development of a so-called “smart
    benefit” design system we suggest can be achieved through blockchain applications
    that work together through the use of smart contract design similar to the Ethereum
    model with modifications that allows for the inclusion of HIPAA compliant privacy
    protocols that providers can modify data of patients via specific permissions.

    are issues that be solved through further software development and the use of
    a blockchain application protocol that allows for scalability, interoperability
    and unique patient and provider access. The ability for the applications to be
    easily modified we suggest will lead to significant cost reductions in not only
    IT system integration but also ongoing maintenance and modifications that offer
    the ability of blockchain to be far more flexible than current health information
    technology systems.

    shortcomings of public and even private legacy health information technology systems.
    In each of the above addressable programs and markets core issues of interoperability,
    data access and privacy and the ability to adapt to changing programs and technology
    are potentially solved through the use of Blockchain applications. We suggest
    that deployment of blockchain applications be incremental in nature as with any
    emerging technology.

    large scale information technology changes. This is evidenced by both the EHR
    rollout by the Veteran's Administration as well the processes that CMS utilizes
    for MMIS, which are understandable and somewhat rationale by policymakers given
    the scale and scope of populations being served. We argue as with Defense Advanced
    Research Projects Agency (DARPA) government examine selective system implementation
    of blockchain that can achieve elusive program goals of interoperability, flexibility
    and needed privacy considerations through experimental programs that focus on
    research that can quantify functionality of the technology and cost savings associated
    with deployment and ongoing maintenance costs.

- en: We suggest that further research should focus on costs associated with deployment,
    ongoing maintenance of systems and the ability of systems integrators to adapt
    to changing programmatic mandates as well as technology innovation. Additionally,
    we suggest that use of multiple types of applications across varying program functions
    would be useful to examine as we have described in this paper. As with any new
    technology, there will be undoubtedly be issues in deployment and implementation
    but we believe that given the adaptive nature of the blockchain and the ability
    to make changes in applications that efficiency and efficacy will demonstrate
    the possibilities we discuss.
