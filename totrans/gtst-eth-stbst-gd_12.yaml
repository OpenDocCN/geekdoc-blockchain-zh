- en: During the course of this book I presented the most common use cases for the
    blockchain today in a simple manner. The idea was to keep it simple and get straight
    to the point. All the examples provided in this book were created to make you
    advance quickly down the learning path. As a developer, I know that the best way
    to learn is by coding, so I wanted to share that way of learning with you.

    is constantly changing, and staying up-to-date as a professional will take you
    many hours and a lot of effort. Don’t let it be overwhelming for you. We all start
    from scratch and learn new skills with baby steps. I hope this book gave you the
    knowledge you need to get started.

    own NFT and put it up for sale on OpenSea, or better yet, you can host your first
    site on IPFS with a custom domain in ENS. You can also query off-chain data using
    Chainlink oracles or use Filecoin to preserve data in a distributed fashion. The
    possibilities are endless.

    Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the future, we will see lots of projects growing and
    others losing space. But never forget that technology exists to solve real problems.
    To apply what you learned in this book, think first about what problems you are
    trying to solve and whether they are best solved with off-chain solutions. At
    the end of the day, the blockchain will help you solve problems related to trust.
    Is a centralized data source trustworthy? Is a centralized application trustworthy?
    If not, go with the blockchain.
