- en: Before my election to Parliament in 2017, I must confess that my knowledge of
    Blockchain technology was underdeveloped. Of course, I knew of cryptocurrencies
    – who didn't? Stories of people trading Bitcoin and making huge fortunes and losses
    were and continue to be widely reported. I certainly had little appreciation of
    the enormous importance of the Blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies and
    how it has the potential to radically change our society. It may seem surprising,
    therefore, to find myself as the chairman of an exciting and active APPG in the
    heart of UK politics.

- en: The reason behind my decision to set up the APPG was simple – I wanted to make
    government more efficient and believed that Blockchain was an opportunity to achieve
    this. A chance conversation with a colleague who was waxing lyrical about Blockchain
    technology got me intrigued, and I knew I had to act, thus the APPG for Blockchain
    was established.

    reached out to experts. Facilitated by the Big Innovation Centre, our first meeting
    received an overwhelming attendance. It was at this meeting that I met the author
    of this book, Antony Welfare, who became a board advisor to the APPG.

    from the economy, industry, and society is profound. It is this enthusiasm and
    characteristically easy-to-understand style that makes this book such an invaluable
    resource.

- en: In a world where there is much contention around data and who controls it, this
    book clearly asserts how this can work in favour of the consumer. Key to this
    are the constant themes of openness and transparency, and the persuasive argument
    that if we want to see the benefits of this technology then we must embrace change.

    on a journey. This is made all the more vivid by his use of his fictional retailer
    the ‘Antony Stores Group’ to illustrate the use cases. The ‘how’ and ‘why’ we
    would use Blockchain help the reader to visualize the real potential of this technology.
