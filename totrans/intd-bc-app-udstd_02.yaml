    computations between systems easier and more secure and tracks assets across the
    business world.

    includes intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and so on. The
    blockchain concept is widely used in the business field.

- en: A blockchain (think of it as a “series of blocks”) is a sharable and unchangeable
    data package. Generally, it can be defined as a digital registry whose entries
    are joined in a series/chains of “blocks” and strung together in sequential order,
    and whose integrity is ensured using cryptography. Although its size will grow
    over time, it is unchangeable because its contents, once written, cannot usually
    be altered or deleted without the entire architecture being invalidated. Tracking
    or trading assets on a blockchain system reduces risks and costs for parties on
    both sides of the transaction.

    (A *distributed ledger* is a shared ledger. It can be a public or private set
    of digital information that’s synchronized and geographically distributed in multiple
    countries, sites, or institutions, without requiring an administrator or centralized
    data management.) This means that these systems are based on a distributed ledger
    that can be read and changed by multiple nodes in a network.

    or identity, nor do they need to trust each other. To ensure integrity and consistency
    between different copies, the addition of a new block is governed worldwide by
    a common rule or protocol. When a block is approved from the network or system,
    each node needs to update its own private copy. Hence, the data structure guarantees
    no future manipulation.

    Nakamoto and was implemented the next year, with the aim of acting as a “ledger”
    (a register of all transactions) for the nascent digital currency Bitcoin. Nakamoto
    used the words *block* and *chain* differently in the original article. In 2009,
    Nakamoto’s creation, Bitcoin, was used for the first time to purchase a physical
    asset: a pizza.'

    the size of its blockchain reached 20 gigabytes. In March 2018, it exceeded 162
    gigabytes. In 2014, the term “Blockchain 2.0” began to be used to refer to a new
    way of using blockchain. The idea was to allow people excluded from the current
    monetization to be able to access a reliable and secure monetary deposit, protect
    their privacy, and monetize their information. According to some authors, it also
    has the potential to resolve the issue of social injustice by changing the way
    wealth is distributed.

    for example, write yourself a letter and send it through the mail. If you leave
    it unopened, you can guarantee that the letter was written before the envelope
    was postmarked. Businesses adopt increasingly complex processes into their daily
    operations to improve the credibility of their internal documentation in the event
    that they are questioned later. In the Internet world, transactions need to be
    done with digital stamps in a secure way. Secure time-stamped digital signatures
    can be created using Bitcoin or blockchain technology.

- en: Hash functions are used in all digital signatures. These methods accept any
    file and generate fixed-length fingerprints, which is a code that uniquely identifies
    the file. Anybody with access to the file may produce the code; however, constructing
    the file from the code is very difficult.

    long run. Moreover, blockchain is an enabling technology that could create new
    technologies and new foundations for the global economy and social environments,
    rather than a disruptive technology that attacks the traditional business model.

    chains, financial and marketing transactions, accounting, and distributed social
    networks. This new technology can be integrated into various sectors, and its
    protocols make it easier for companies to adopt new methods for processing and
    managing digital transactions.

    crowd sales, implementation of the prediction market, and generic governance tools.
    Blockchain can be used to certify the date of a document and verify that it has
    not been tampered with. This application of blockchain, obtained by inserting
    the hash of the documents to be certified, is called *notarization*  . An example
    of this is the notarization of the movements of trucks that are transporting land
    from a construction site, in order to ensure compliance with environmental standards.

    increase their interoperability and security. Several blockchains have also been
    developed for storing data, publishing text, and identifying the origin of digital
    art. For example, a bank has opened research centers dedicated to blockchain to
    study the various implications of this new technology on financial services with
    the goal to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Another application has been
    proposed to share wireless networks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Businesses depend on information. In the business world, the faster and more
    accurate that information is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for providing this
    type of information because it provides instant, sharable, and fully transparent
    data that’s stored in an unchangeable ledger. Only authorized individuals can
    view the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, a blockchain network can trace orders, money transactions, account
    ledgers, and production processes, among other things. Because members share a
    common information that is contained in the blockchain, it’s also possible to
    see all the data of an end-to-end transaction (it’s fully transparent to all the
    parties), leading to higher trust as well as new improvements and future uses.
