    The creative industries have left behind deterministic value chains and operate

    uncertain. There are dynamic uncertainties around ownership—who owns what and
    when—and recent developments such as micro-licensing have led to dynamic uncertainties
    around availability. Rights ownership and availability will have to be determined

    What the Copyright Act did for commercial rights, the Berne Convention (Convention

    creative industries. Faced with the societal impacts of new distribution technologies,
    legislators balance citizens’ freedoms of access with creators’ rights to remuneration.

    during a specific time window, and the songwriter of the penultimate track may

- en: There was a time when the terms piracy and Digital Rights Management (DRM) were
    the buzzwords of the industry. Technological protection measures are access control
    technologies meant to restrict the use of copyrighted works. They tried to control
    the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works such as software
    and multimedia content, as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies
    (Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada [2006](#CR20)). This was not a success.
    First, it went against fair use policies and the right granted to consumers to
    make a few private copies. Second, it limited voluntarily the propagation of content
    only because the publishers could not monetise the copies. Recognising that DRM
    was counterproductive, content industries and policymakers introduced levies,
    a suboptimal blanket tax on the copying systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The IoV could change that. Indeed, it should not prevent copies, provided that
    each new copy is automatically monetizable; in this case, it should incentivise
    copying. Digital watermarks and digital fingerprints are tools to identify contents
    and trigger their protection, local enrichment or semi-automated monetisation.
    The breakthrough for automated monetizable propagation could come from the development
    of non-fungible tokens as shown by the CryptoKitties game. Non-fungible tokens
    represent something unique and are thus not interchangeable. They are used to
    create verifiable digital scarcity, user ownership, and the possibility of asset
    interoperability across multiple contexts in applications that require unique
    digital items. They are controlled by the user, instead of the publisher. This
    lets the assets be traded on third-party marketplaces without permission from
    the originator. Theoretically, a combination of content-based standard identifiers,
    non-fungible tokens and fungible sub-tokens could solve the challenge—notwithstanding
    the scalability question.

    enterprise interactions. Tokenisation, integration and a solution to the blockchain
    trilemma have been mentioned. We also need a shift from private blockchains used
    by corporations to public blockchains used by everybody, whereby the integration
    of both types could be the better approach. Private blockchains protect the privacy
    and security of their data. Participation requires an invitation, which itself
    is validated by a set of rules. Such blockchains are known as *permissioned* blockchains
    and are preferred for B2B transactions. Public blockchains are open networks that
    allow anyone to participate. These *permissionless* blockchains depend upon the
    number of users for their success, hence, they encourage participation through
    incentives. Today, they appear indispensable for B2C transactions. Furthermore,
    we need a transition from cryptocurrencies to fiat-backed *stablecoins* although,
    again, the integration of both types of money could be the better method, just
    like the incentivising compatibility of loyalty points and government-backed currencies.

    The use of identification standards is sporadic. Metadata structures differ significantly,
    are incomplete and contain errors. The poor quality of rights and catalogue metadata,
    and a century of failed attempts to standardise them, necessitate the development
    of intelligent metadata *ingestors*. These *ingestors* will rely on machine-trained

    development. Since the 1990s, the Internet has been the main driver of influence,
    profoundly affecting how people create, transmit and share information worldwide,
    consequently changing the structure of the media sector. Although digital technologies
    are transforming the media sector, various challenges are arising as seen in fake
    news and echo chamber. This chapter explores how distributed ledger technology
    (DLT) and blockchain technologies can contribute to solving new challenges in
    the media sector. This is worth exploring because the central advantages of blockchain/DLT
    are related to trust, and the new challenges in the media sector are mainly related
    to the lack of trust. This chapter provides a framework to show the benefits of
    using blockchain/DLT and discusses how those benefits can solve the challenges

    the media sector. Table [1](#Tab1) shows the change in key attributes of media
    at a macro-level, comparing newspaper, radio/TV, and the Internet. The flow of
    information has shifted from “One to N (a number of people)” to “N to N”. This
    shift reflects a change in key resource constraints to disseminate information.Table

    played important roles as key resource constraints. Radio/TV also requires similar
    resources such as radio wave licenses and broadcasting facilities. However, in
    the Internet age, all that is needed is an Internet connection and low-cost devices
    to disseminate information, such that a vast number of people have begun creating
    and publishing information.

    development. The logistics of physical papers have limited newspapers; content
    of Radio/TV has been transmitted to the extent of the reach of radio waves. However,
    information on the Internet can be transmitted globally as long as audiences are
    connected to it (although language differences are working partly as practical
    barriers to information flow). Consequently, the role of collecting and disseminating
    information has been drastically expanded from only a limited number of professionals
    to a wide range of participants, including ordinary citizens. The amount of information
    circulating in society has also exploded.

- en: In web-news media, the four valuable functions of media are provided by professionals
    of the media sector. This has not changed substantially since traditional media
    such as newspapers and televisions. However, blogs can already be written by anyone
    who has an Internet connection. The written blogs are posted without curation,
    and usually no one officially takes the role of structuring discussion points
    or offering a public space for discussion aside from individual authors’ opinions.
    Thus, audiences have to search for information which matches their interests from
    a vast number of blogs online.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Emerging social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook were designed to
    solve the curation problem by managing information based on the social connections
    of users. Curation by Internet search engines, such as Google, has also become
    more important, as the amount of information has exploded, making it difficult
    for people to find what they are looking for without assistance. Therefore, important
    functions of media are provided increasingly by platform services such as Google,
    Facebook, and Twitter. Regarding presenting discussion points and providing public
    spaces for discussion, it is generally autonomously provided by users but greatly
    influenced by the curation of platforms, as platforms control what information
    is presented to each user.
  prefs: []

    is conducted by “black box” algorithms, which include various variables such as
    users’ preferences and social networks. It is difficult to audit the algorithms
    and compare personalised outcomes. This issue raises concerns over trust in new
    media compared to traditional media.

    and the distinction between producer and consumer of information has become vague.
    Anybody can collect, produce, and disseminate information and opinions on a global
    scale and at a low cost. This has caused an “explosion” of information, making
    it difficult for audiences to find important information. Platforms such as social
    media were introduced to solve the problem by curating information based on social
    networks, but several problems arose, as illustrated in the next section.

    by the general public, the variety and quantity of information have been widely
    enriched in society. Moreover, it is the person who knows the topic best who can
    provide the most valuable information. For example, reviews by actual users of
    washing machines and refrigerators are sometimes more valuable than reviews by
    professionals who have not actually used the appliances in their daily lives.
    However, the impact of the Internet on the media sector has also raised several
    challenges, as shown below.

    and disseminate information through websites, weblogs, and social media. Fake
    news can be defined as the intentional dissemination of false information with
    a certain purpose. It is sometimes based on a political goal or interest, or simply
    aims to cause confusion in society. Fake news occurs because there are no mechanisms
    to check the quality of information at the origin, and by people’s intrinsic willingness
    to disseminate information, which is amplified when the information is surprising.

    other users, advertisement expenditure has been shifting from traditional media
    to Internet platforms. Google’s advertisement revenue reached USD 95.4 billion
    in 2018 compared to all US newspapers earning USD 16.5 billion (Fox [2019](#CR2)).
    However, web services and social media companies such as Google or Facebook only
    convey information on their platforms. They do not bear the same responsibility
    for writing, editing, and checking the information accuracy as the traditional
    media sector. As the traditional media sector declines, it could become difficult
    to maintain jobs for such professional editors and journalists.

    prioritising “click” rates, people tend to be exposed only to views similar to
    their own. This phenomenon is called “Echo chamber” or “Filter bubble” (Pariser
    [2011](#CR6)). This is caused by various web services from search engines, web-news
    to social media platforms as soon as they personalise content based on users’
    preferences and past activities. Consequently, people are wrongly inclined to
    feel as if all others think as they do.

    media to Internet services. However, Internet advertisement is facing another
    problem: ad fraud (“Ad Fraud”; Wikipedia, [2020](#CR9)). This occurs when the
    number of advertisement exposures to audiences is manipulated and reported to
    advertisers, who then must pay excessive fees for ads. In other cases, online
    advertisement is not displayed at all for viewers but hidden behind a website
    and counted as if they were actually viewed by audiences. It is estimated that
    ad fraud will reach USD 50 billion by 2025 (Shields [2016](#CR7)). This is a consequence
    of the difficulty of tracing activities online, compared to newspaper adverts,
    which can easily be checked by advertisers through printed papers.'

    factor behind the challenges is the lack of trust caused by the explosion of the
    number of players creating and disseminating information. The central topic of
    this chapter is how these challenges can be solved by blockchain/DLT; therefore,
    the next section explores the benefits and advantages of using the technology.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conventional information systems protect information from being tampered with
    by building firewalls and via strict user-authentication techniques. However,
    blockchain/DLT can protect information from manipulation by linking data from
    its origin to its latest status and by auditing the data in transparent settings.
    In other words, blockchain/DLT can ensure the integrity of data even if the information
    is shared with a number of anonymous users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tampering. This means that protecting the integrity of data is no longer a core
    function of some organisations, and its role can be delegated to the blockchain
    network.

    as practised by the University of Nicosia ([2015](#CR8)) and the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology (MIT [2020](#CR5)). They store the key information of
    the education certificate (typically a hash value of certificate) in the Bitcoin
    blockchain, thus ensuring that the digital certificate is genuine and not counterfeited.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most blockchain/DLT platforms provide a function to build a linkage between
    value and specific entities, such as Bitcoin and Bitcoin owners. Given that blockchain/DLT
    does not depend on the trust of specific organisations or authorities, blockchain/DLT
    enables everyone to create a system to manage value. These systems can capture,
    record, and symbolise various types of value and transfer this value across diverse
    stakeholders. Typical usages are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but many types
    of value, such as electricity and land ownership, can be managed with blockchain/DLT.
    This attribute also works to create various incentive mechanisms driven by the
    issuance of tokens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Various examples using this attribute can be observed. For example, Ant Financial
    provides a blockchain-based inter-exchange system between mobile payment services.
    They constructed a blockchain-based system to connect Alipay and GCash in the
    Philippines, so that users of each service can send money across different mobile
    payment platforms. In another example, Earn.com integrates Application Programming
    Interfaces to micro-payments and enables the value of small data to be captured
    and makes them tradable between anonymous stakeholders. As an extension of embedding
    payments in M2M transactions, electricity is also a significant field using blockchain/DLT.
    Digital Grid, a Japan-based electricity technology company, is providing an ecosystem
    in which houses and buildings can exchange solar-powered electricity by using
    blockchain, which manages the flow of electricity and coordinates market transactions
    of electricity (DIGITAL GRID Corporation [2020](#CR1)).

    of foods to ensure that the products they sell are genuine and safe. On the other
    hand, the UK government conducted a trial using cryptocurrency technology for
    welfare payments to check that the assistance is provided as intended by legislation.
    In another instance, Startbahn created a system which manages the trade of artworks,
    so that the original creators can obtain a certain portion of the value generated

    to a lack of trust, therefore these challenges could be solved by blockchain/DLT-based
    solutions. The following argument discusses how blockchain/DLT can solve the key
    challenges introduced in Sect. [2](#Sec6), considering the benefits of blockchain/DLT
    as shown in Sect. [3](#Sec11).

- en: Against fake news, the central approach is to minimise the incentives to disseminate
    false information and motivate people to share only truthful information. As truthful
    information has a certain value for society, “value circulation” approaches can
    be used. Typically, tokenisation can be considered, such as seen in its primitive
    form in Bitcoin, where token issuance motivates people to contribute to maintaining
    the trust of information in Bitcoin payments. Examples of this approach are observed
    in Steemit^([1](#Fn1)) and ALIS,^([2](#Fn2)) which issue and use tokens to incentivise
    people to create and share information highly valued by others. However, it is
    worth noting that incentivisation by token issuance should be carefully analysed
    and designed to assure that its value formation is sustainable. Another method
    is to store a complete record of information history by using anti-tampering,
    and traceability approaches so that one can trace back how fake news is disseminated.
    However, this should also be carefully considered in order to avoid sacrificing
    privacy and the right to free speech.

    approach could be used to securely store and share how much each article is viewed
    and valued by others, to ensure the author of the information is appropriately
    compensated. It is also possible to include evaluation mechanisms by audiences.
    It is a particularly reliable solution where platforms are earning excessive rent
    and writers are not appropriately compensated.

    as curators of information, the key to the solution for the Echo chamber problem
    is the behaviour of the platform providers. The focus should be on enhancing the
    trust in and transparency of the algorithms curating information for users for
    the audiences to understand and check how information is selected and displayed
    to each user. The anti-tampering attribute could be used to store the curating
    algorithm and compare the results of curation across different users.

    and value circulation. With anti-tampering, displayed ads or their identifiers
    can be stored from users’ web browsers into blockchain/DLT, and the payment of
    advertisers can be based on the stored information. This approach depends on the
    functionality of web browsers but can reduce the risk of manipulated records of
    advertisement. On the other hand, as an example of the value circulation approach,
    Hakuhodo, a Japanese advertising agency, is creating a solution which converts
    digital advertisements into digital assets so that users can proactively collect
    digital ads rather than passively view displayed ads. In this case, collected
    digital ads can be used, for example, discount coupons for products of the advertisers
    (HAKUHODO [2019](#CR4)).'

    driven by the Internet revolution. As technology has empowered people to create,
    collect, and disseminate information, the media sector is facing a different ecosystem
    involving a proactive public rather than simply media professionals. Alongside
    this transformation, there is the challenge of making the media space trustable

    as seen in anti-tampering, value circulation, and traceability. Therefore, blockchain/DLT
    can contribute to solving the challenges. However, it should also be noted that
    blockchain/DLT is only one of the components of societal ecosystems, and that
    it alone cannot fully solve the problems. The challenges in the media sector relate
    to a wide range of social elements such as mediation, incentive, evaluation, industry,
    and occupation. Trust in twenty-first-century media should therefore be reinforced
    via the full combination of business, legal and technological solutions.
