    Evan, dealing out hands. “People in Great Britain got so excited about the potential
    for railroads that they drove up the price of railroad stocks to stratospheric
    heights. Then you had these powerful railroad capitalists that were manipulating
    the market behind the scenes and paying off journalists to build up the hype cycle.
    Then, when it came crashing down, all these middle-class families lost their life
    savings.”

    putting their life savings into some overhyped stock. A lot of times, they win.
    Then they make another big bet, and the next time they lose. They should be at
    the casino, where at least you get free drinks.” He took a sip.

    at the beginning of the stock market. They had the same problems. Lots of speculators.
    No good yardsticks. So he created some simple metrics to measure the market as
    a whole. He came up with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was just the
    average of the twelve big industrial company stocks. Financial genius.”

- en: In 1997 the British rocker David Bowie introduced a novel investment vehicle
    called the “Bowie Bond.” In collaboration with the investment banker David Pullman,^([24](notes.html#ch00-fn24))
    the Bowie Bond offered an interest rate of 7.9 percent over ten years. Let’s explain
    in plain English how this worked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As an investor, you’d buy a Bowie Bond, backed by the future earnings on David
    Bowie’s music. Let’s say you invested $10,000: a “loan” to David Bowie and his
    bankers. Using the royalties from songs like “Space Oddity,” they would pay you
    7.9 percent interest until the bond matured, then pay you back the $10,000.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bonds were given an investor-grade rating from Moody’s,^([25](notes.html#ch00-fn25))
    and ultimately raised $55 million,^([26](notes.html#ch00-fn26)) which Bowie used
    to buy back rights to his old recordings, as well as invest in a number of new
    businesses.^([27](notes.html#ch00-fn27))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bowie was opting for a guaranteed up-front payment instead of future royalties.
    Bowie invested his payout in new Internet companies—just as file-sharing services
    like Napster began to decimate the music business. He jumped from the building
    as it exploded, only to land on a hovercraft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: David Bowie tokenized his music. He showed that his music had future value,
    then he packaged it in a way that let investors buy just a piece of that future
    value. Bowie didn’t invent the concept of bonds, but he showed that even something
    as ephemeral as music could be split into fractional shares.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about how weird this must have been for investors. “You’re buying a piece
    of Bowie’s music?” you can picture some guy asking his business associate. “And
    that has value why?” You can be sure many of the same arguments we hear today
    about blockchain tokens played out with the Bowie Bond.

    the chair, the very picture of insouciance.
