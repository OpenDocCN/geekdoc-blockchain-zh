    Evan, dealing out hands. “People in Great Britain got so excited about the potential
    for railroads that they drove up the price of railroad stocks to stratospheric
    heights. Then you had these powerful railroad capitalists that were manipulating
    the market behind the scenes and paying off journalists to build up the hype cycle.
    Then, when it came crashing down, all these middle-class families lost their life

    the Bowie Bond offered an interest rate of 7.9 percent over ten years. Let’s explain

- en: 'As an investor, you’d buy a Bowie Bond, backed by the future earnings on David
    Bowie’s music. Let’s say you invested $10,000: a “loan” to David Bowie and his

    7.9 percent interest until the bond matured, then pay you back the $10,000.'

- en: Bowie was opting for a guaranteed up-front payment instead of future royalties.
    Bowie invested his payout in new Internet companies—just as file-sharing services
    like Napster began to decimate the music business. He jumped from the building
    as it exploded, only to land on a hovercraft.

- en: David Bowie tokenized his music. He showed that his music had future value,
    then he packaged it in a way that let investors buy just a piece of that future
    value. Bowie didn’t invent the concept of bonds, but he showed that even something
    as ephemeral as music could be split into fractional shares.

  zh: 大卫·鲍伊将他的音乐进行了代币化。他表明他的音乐有未来的价值，然后他以一种让投资者可以购买未来价值的一部分的方式包装它。鲍伊没有发明债券的概念，但他表明，即使是像音乐这样短暂的东西也可以分成份额。
- en: Think about how weird this must have been for investors. “You’re buying a piece
    of Bowie’s music?” you can picture some guy asking his business associate. “And
    that has value why?” You can be sure many of the same arguments we hear today
    about blockchain tokens played out with the Bowie Bond.
