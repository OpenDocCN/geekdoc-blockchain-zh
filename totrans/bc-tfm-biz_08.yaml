    are the product of six years of research conducted by Harvard Professor John Ruggie
    [274]. They are based on 47 consultations and site visits in more than 20 countries,
    and involve governments, companies, business associations, civil society, and
    investors. According to Oxfam, they are an authoritative global reference point
    for business and human rights, and they implement ethical trade by ensuring that
    governments and companies have a collective responsibility to protect human rights
    in business enterprises. Most of the work done by the UN to ensure that these
    rights are recognised and upheld around the world is conducted by the International
    Labour Organization (ILO).

    and consumers, it is important to ensure both fair distribution of wealth along
    this line and timely payment along the way. Until now, this has been very difficult
    because a price is often set at the end of the process, whereas the most financially
    vulnerable have done the hardest work and laid out the most risk at the start
    of the production line. Blockchain technology can improve the experience for all
    participants, including the end-consumer. It allows buyers and receivers to track
    the movement of goods and the exchanges made along the way. Meanwhile, information,
    including history, transport, events, and ownership, can be used to verify authenticity.

    quality of produce and products, and the back story of the human interaction with
    their production and supply; it is also about ensuring equal pay for equal work.
    Smart contracts can ensure the integrity of payment systems by reporting to the
    network that payment has been made and how much of the price paid went to the
    grower or worker responsible for its production. Equal pay for equal work is regarded
    by the UN as a human right. Fair Trade is one of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development
    Goals. The blockchain’s capacity to audit and automate transactions can play a
    significant part in the achievement of this particular goal.
