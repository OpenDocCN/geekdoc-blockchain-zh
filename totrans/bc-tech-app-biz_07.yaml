  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Biopharmaceutical companies and health authorities continuously exchange information
    to provide safe and effective therapeutics. The interactions between the two require
    transparency and extensive documentation exchange concerning the processes which
    extend from the development through the manufacturing phase. The current processes
    rely on paper documentation, notebooks, and point-to-point electronic data interchange
    (EDI) for the storage of data. Thereby, generating challenges of data integrity
    within the internal siloed structures and the traceability of the medicinal products
    in the pursuit to avoid counterfeiting. With Industry 4.0 and blockchain, the
    authors envisioned a reinvented workflow that helps to 1) manage data integrity
    with decentralized trust and 2) improve the track and trace capabilities. Hence,
    biopharmaceutical companies can manage data in a more trustable manner while maintaining
    security and privacy, further enabling the external ecosystem with track and trace
    to ensure complete transparency until the therapeutics reach patients.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the 18th century, industrial revolutions transformed the production processes
    from one leaning around craftsmanship to an economy of industrialized machines
    and processes. Leading to an exponential rise in Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
    each of the industrial revolutions (1st Mechanical, 2nd Electrical, 3rd Electronical
    and 4th Cyber-Physical) revolutionized the technological, socio-economical, and
    cultural levels of societies. Overall, these revolutions provided increased affordability
    and accessibility of products, along with an enhanced quality of life. Although
    each industrial revolution also entailed negative and untended environmental and
    social consequences, they have improved work through innovations, reducing the
    demand for physical and repetitive labor activities, as the latter can be executed
    more efficiently by machines. This has led to the rise of knowledge-intensive
    labourers, which encouraged the migration of people to industrialized zones (Rafferty,
    2018). Nowadays, society is witnessing the fourth industrial revolution, which
    is characterized by the integration and synergies stemming from a wide range of
    technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Big Data
    Analytics, Distributed Ledger Technologies, Robotics, Augmented, Virtual and Mixed
    Reality, Additive and Smart Manufacturing, Quantum Computing, the Cloud and Edge
    Computing. These technologies are empowering important developments in manufacturing
    industries as a lever for productivity, improving quality processes, expanding
    product portfolio, understanding customer behaviour, enhancing costs effectiveness,
    and reducing time to market.

    industry is not an exception. Digital emerging technologies are affecting the
    value chain of the biopharmaceutical industry, from Research & Development to
    the Commercialization stage. However, the biopharmaceutical industry ranks lowest
    for the use and adoption of digital technologies in comparison to other industries
    such as retail, finance, media and insurance (Gopal, Suter-Crazzolara, Toldo,
    & Eberhardt, 2019), due to a challenging regulatory framework (Cauchon, Oghamian,
    Hassanpour, & Abernathy, 2019).

    that deals with the discovery, development, manufacturing, and distribution of
    medications towards specific health conditions to provide treatments for underlying
    disease conditions of patients and improve their quality of life. It has two major
    categories “small molecules” and “biologics or biopharmaceuticals”. Small molecules
    are produced by chemical synthesis and have a well-defined chemical structure.
    Instead, biopharmaceuticals are produced from biological sources and consists
    of a complex and heterogeneous structure (Declerck, 2012). These differences are
    responsible for a wide gap in the production costs between small molecules and
    biopharmaceuticals (Makurvet, 2021). Furthermore, the production of biopharmaceutical
    drugs has a more stringent regulatory pathway in comparison to small molecules
    due to their complexities, and this impacts the drug development process and the
    time to market. Indeed, the annual Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals
    for biopharmaceutical products are less than the small molecules (Torre & Albericio,
    2021). Moreover, a decline in the productivity of biopharmaceutical research and
    development led to increased costs within the past few decades (Farid, Baron,
    Stamatis, Nie, & Coffman, 2020; Scannell, Blanckley, Boldon, & Warrington, 2012).
    At the same time, the development and manufacturing of therapeutic drugs necessitate
    sophisticated instrumentation, human capital, scientific knowledge, and stringent
    regulatory adherence to bring innovative healthcare products to the market to
    satisfy patient’s needs. Overall, the drug development process takes on an average
    of 12 years (Van Norman, 2016) and involves costs up to US$2B (Mullard, 2014).
    In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved 48 novel drugs (FDA, 2020b)
    while pharmaceutical companies worldwide had more than 16 thousand drugs in their
    Research and Development pipelines (Pharma R&D Annual Review, 2020).

- en: Among the players in the biopharmaceutical ecosystem, a major role in the development,
    launch, and monitoring of therapeutic products is driven by the interactions between
    biopharmaceutical companies and health authorities. Indeed, the collaboration
    among companies and regulators is of utmost importance to bring safe and effective
    medications towards patient care, cure, and improvement. Health authorities are
    responsible to authorize the development, manufacturing, and commercialization
    of biopharmaceuticals products within their legislation power. For example, the
    Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, the European Medicines
    Agency (EMA) in the European Union, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) in Italy,
    and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United
    Kingdom. Furthermore, the International Council for Harmonization of Technical
    Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is an effort to harmonize
    guidelines across the globe, given the global scale of operations of modern biopharmaceutical
    companies. Among other activities, health authorities establish regulations to
    which biopharmaceuticals companies must comply, such as the Current Good Manufacturing
    Practices (CGMPs) and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), enforced by the Food
    and Drug Administration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Biopharmaceutical companies must abide by these guidelines and regulations,
    and a minimum of one comprehensive CGMPs evaluation is performed on the organization
    every two years (FDA, 2014). The non-compliance to regulation can result in a
    loss of company reputation, safety-related risks to patients, expensive fines,
    or retraction from the market, depending on the nature of the violation. In 2019,
    CGMPs deviations were the major cause of product recalls in pharmaceutical products
    in the United States (Stericycle, n.d.). To ensure the highest quality standard,
    biopharmaceutical companies stringently test the quality of samples from every
    single batch of produced drugs, to confirm that the therapeutic product is within
    the specifications of safety and efficacy as defined in the initial drug approval
    submission to the health authorities. Over time, the drug manufacturing process
    evolves consistently to exceed the minimum standards with innovative processes
    and systems that ensure quality by design and operational excellence towards a
    compliant drug manufacturing process that guarantees the quality of therapeutic
    products towards excellent therapeutic outcomes for patients across the world.

    and cooperate with the final objective of providing safe and effective therapeutics.
    The interactions between the two require transparency and extensive documentation
    exchanges concerning the processes which extend from the development phase all
    the way through its manufacturing phase, and at last, on the product data. The
    data contained in the documentation must be verified and maintained, and this
    process is resource consuming. Nowadays, thanks to industry 4.0 and the emergence
    of advanced digital technologies such as blockchain, there is an opportunity to
    have a lean and smart process that can increase coordination and trust across
    the various stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Our conceptual proposal
    is to envision the organization of internal and external ecosystems for positioning
    the blockchain technology in the healthcare sector with a modular setup. The scope
    is to allow a leaner technology implementation to address the current challenges
    of data integrity in the internal siloed structures of the biopharmaceutical company
    to increase transparency, trust, and coordination. This is to further extend the
    ecosystem to facilitate the track and trace necessities from regulators and bring
    this transparency through to the patient. As a conceptual instantiation in this
    chapter, our concept is designed within one function (actor/stakeholder), i.e.,
    by detailing the use of the blockchain in the biopharmaceutical quality control
    focusing on the data integrity aspect.

    many complex interactions between the internal functions of the biopharmaceutical
    company (regarded as an internal ecosystem) and amounts to a large and comprehensive
    data generation and exchange across multiple internal groups, such as Research
    & Development, Manufacturing, Quality, Technical Services, Supply Chain, and many
    others. As the therapeutic product moves outside of the biopharmaceutical company
    towards the external ecosystem to reach the patients, another set of players is
    involved that range from suppliers to distributors, health authorities, hospitals,
    pharmacists etc. (see Figure 2). This involves higher external cross-organizational
    interactions, the need for transparency and efficient coordination among players.

    eliminate the current challenges of data silos, to centralize information and
    improve communications. All these barriers may affect the process of sharing data
    and information towards higher regulatory compliance. However, the process has
    been slow and still many of the workflows rely on paper documentation, notebooks,
    and point-to-point Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for the storage of data.
    At the same time, data integrity is of utmost importance for biopharmaceutical
    companies. Data integrity refers to the “Completeness, consistency, and accuracy
    of data” as by Food and Drug Administration Guidance (Food and Drug Administration,
    2016) and revolves around the ALCOA principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous,
    Originals, Accurate) and Good Documentation Practices (GDP). The former encompasses
    that Complete, consistent, and accurate data should be attributable, legible,
    contemporaneously recorded, original or a true copy, and accurate (ALCOA) (Food
    and Drug Administration, 2016). In recent years, Health authorities (e.g., FDA,
    EMA, MHRA) have issued warning letters, import alerts and consent decrees for
    the non-compliance involving data integrity, as it is an important element to
    ensure and monitor safety, efficacy and quality of therapeutic products (EMA,
    2016a; Food and Drug Administration, 2016; Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory
    Agency, 2018). Hence, data integrity is a critical area within the biopharmaceutical
    companies for ensuring the therapeutic product to be safe and efficacious. Majorly,
    data integrity issues are related to inconsistent storage of data, lack of traceability,
    errors in the data entries (due to typos or fraud) (Morrell, 2017; Rattan, 2018).
    Thus, generating a lack of trust in the digital data. Therefore, there is an immediate
    need for a new technological system to provide traceability, data accuracy, visibility,
    security, and connected real-time data in biopharmaceutical companies. Technological
    advances as blockchain have been proposed as a potential solution for addressing
    the data integrity challenges. For example, Steinwandter & Herwig, 2019 have elaborated
    a workflow based on git control versioning, Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts
    to guarantee the data integrity in the data storage systems, that can be audited
    by regulatory agencies (Steinwandter & Herwig, 2019). Similarly, an article by
    Morrell, 2017 envisions the use of blockchain to capture the data along the life
    cycle of the pharmaceutical product (Morrell, 2017).

    products; the United States FDA has released the Drug Supply Chain Security Act
    (DSCSA) that outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify
    and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.
    This will enhance FDA’s ability to help protect consumers from exposure to drugs
    that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The system
    will also improve detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the
    drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers (adapted from (Jung & Food, 2014)).
    Thus, there would be a necessity of enabling track and trace capability within
    the pharmaceutical supply chain by 2023\. In a similar vein, the European Union
    released the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) to harmonize measures against
    medicine falsifications, and to ensure drug safety and controls of medicine trade.
    The directive includes obligatory safety features a unique identifier and an anti-tampering
    device on the outer packaging of medicines, a shared, EU wide logo to identify
    legal online pharmacies, Tougher rules on the import of active pharmaceutical
    ingredients, strengthened record-keeping requirements for wholesale distributors
    (EU, 2021). As a part of the DSCSA Pilot Program under the FDA, several pilot
    projects were initiated to explore and evaluate the processes and technological
    areas to enhance the safety and security of the drug supply chain with the blockchain
    technology (FDA, 2019, 2020a). Specific pilot projects were initiated to address
    the areas of Interoperability, Processes (serialization, product tracing, verification/notifications,
    aggregation, exceptions handling…), Data (simulated/real, product/transaction),
    Systems/Architecture/Databases, Technologies (blockchain, data carriers, barcode
    readability), Governance and Implementation Challenges. The key purpose is to
    enhance traceability of the therapeutic product, to ensure that the right patient
    receives the correct medicinal product at a proper dosage via a correct route
    of administration at the right time (Klein & Stolk, 2018). The current approaches
    are focused on the track and trace at the level of batch numbers and the European
    Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends a routine bar code scanning at all points in
    the supply chain(EMA, 2016b; Klein & Stolk, 2018).

    internal ecosystem of the pharmaceutical companies to address the aspects of data
    integrity and connect the internal siloed structures of the pharmaceutical company
    to increase transparency, trust, and coordination, for adherence to regulatory
    guidelines in an efficient manner. Moreover, the internal blockchain ecosystem
    would be a trigger to extend and connect with the external ecosystem, to facilitate
    the track and trace necessities from regulators and bring transparency through
    to the patient, and to ascertain the distribution of authentic and safe medicinal
    products. Thus, facilitating the introduction of blockchain with a modular set-up.
    From the perspective of managing the transformation, the internal ecosystem is
    partly standardized, and it will be easier to establish the introduction of blockchain
    technology in a less complex internal ecosystem first, and then extend to a higher
    level of complexity within the external ecosystem. Indeed, keeping a set of information
    filters at the merger between the internal and external ecosystem. Thus, sharing
    externally only the data that is relevant for the track and trace, that verifies
    the authenticity of the medicinal products.

    is not by itself an assurance of error-free products or processes. To test and
    monitor the quality of products, specific functions inside a biopharmaceutical
    company are devoted to the monitoring of the product’s features. According to
    the Food and Drug Administration, The pharmaceutical quality control laboratory
    serves one of the most important functions in pharmaceutical production and control
    (FDA, 2014). Quality Control activities are of paramount importance in the process
    of the market release of safe drugs. Quality Control Laboratories (QC) are part
    of the core activities of the “pharmaceutical quality system” in biopharmaceutical
    companies for testing the quality of final products, in-process samples and the
    raw materials used in the manufacturing process. In order to accomplish its mission
    of monitoring product quality, a typical Quality Control (QC) laboratory is equipped
    with sophisticated scientific instruments (e.g., microscopes, centrifuges, chromatography
    systems, sample preparation equipment) managed by knowledgeable operators (e.g.,
    scientists, biologists, and statisticians) that test the quality of samples of
    every batch of medicinal products, according to a set of standard methods and
    procedures, to verify the conformity of the product to its specifications and
    ensure safety and efficacy. The testing allows monitoring of the product quality
    to ensure the efficacy and safety of the therapeutic product. The Quality Control
    operations follow Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) adhering to regulatory
    and compliance guidelines with clear and concise documentation. Typically, the
    product testing is performed as by the standard operating procedures (SOPs), using
    an analytical method that is specifically developed and validated for quality
    testing purposes. The sequential steps encountered in the product testing involve
    sample preparations, analyzing the sample on scientific equipment, data acquisition
    and processing, interpretation of results, and reporting. The Quality Control
    operations are under constant pressure to adhere to the schedules and the delivery
    of test results as right first time being on the critical path for the final product
    release for commercialization. Thus, minimalizing the margins for manual errors,
    variabilities, and non-compliances. Hence, these aspects have a higher impact
    on the business costs and compliance with health regulators. In this context,
    the need for clear and concise documentation translates into additional efforts,
    that arise within the biopharmaceutical organization. Currently, the process for
    assuring data integrity does not rely on a blockchain system, and the process
    is partially manual with operator checks and using traditional IT systems and
    databases.

    In 2018, approximately 40% of warning letters included a data integrity component
    (Unger, 2019). Examples of data integrity issues sampled from FDA’s warning letter
    range from data signatures that did not match the person who was present on that
    working day, or the backdating of results to meet requirements or the alteration
    of original raw data. Within the digitalization drive, the systems need to be
    integrated and the interconnections defined. However, even the structuring of
    the data systems, internal to the biopharmaceutical industry, is a complex process
    involving multiple functional stakeholders and it is prone to data integrity issues.
    This leads to inconsistencies, multiple sources of data, or accidental errors
    or typos. Structuring the data of the entire process of developing drugs towards
    its market release is difficult to manage and retrieving data is challenging and
    inefficient, often leading to the loss of information. The automatic system facilitates
    the process, eliminating annoying steps such as that of interpreting incomprehensible
    notes from scientists or accidental typos, further strengthening the adherence
    of working in compliance.

- en: The monitoring of compliance and quality of products and processes within the
    Quality Control function generates data that is crucial to understand the compliance
    performance and the control of variabilities within the entire lifecycle of the
    biopharmaceutical product. The generated data is inscribed into documentations
    as reported in physical and digital archives (i.e., paper, or electronic records),
    and are stored in various formats from paper-based to digital files that include
    the processed data, metadata, and raw data. According to the Good Manufacturing
    Practices requirements, all the activities must be comprehensively documented.
    The documentations broadly cover the actions of operators such as results of experiments
    on the test samples, the use and maintenance of equipment (e.g., calibration,
    cleaning), historical records dealing with the operator’s training (confirming
    that they are qualified and trained to perform the tasks), and environmental data
    on physical parameters such as temperature. The information is usually stored
    in the Quality Control laboratory notebooks or instrument logbooks (either paper-based
    or electronic). Hence, adherence to compliance entails efforts on data related
    to the generation (e.g., documentation), maintenance (e.g., retention), verification
    (e.g., the cost for search) and sharing (e.g., with the health authorities and
    within the organization) of data. Thus, there is high complexity in operating
    processes and a variety of data is generated throughout the steps of the process.
    Consequently, the integrity of data inscribed in documentations is of paramount
    importance in the biopharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the audits carried out
    when monitoring the status of compliance often rely on document inspections and
    analysis. To ensure that the data is reliable, its management revolves around
    the principles of data quality, compliance, and audibility. Indeed, all the data
    outflows and inflows in the Quality Control labs have to satisfy the principles
    of Attributability, Legibility, Contemporaneity, Originality, and Accuracy (ALCOA)
    (PICS/S Secretariat, 2018). To synthesize, the ALCOA principles are reported in

    and hospitals) through internal validation mechanisms. Thus, the set-up within
    the Minimum Viable Ecosystem is to be configured internally as a closed enterprise
    blockchain, linking different functions within the same organization with a restricted
    and preapproved group of participants with a specific role and privileges. An
    internal private blockchain intends to preserve the intellectual property related
    to the information on the products and their processes. Thus, not fully available
    for public disclosure. The gateway between the internal and external ecosystem
    is to be configured to allow the linkage of limited internal information to the
    product in accordance with the track and trace needs from the regulators. The
    authors envision the external environment as a second component of the blockchain
    solution. That is, an external public permissioned blockchain is set up to allow
    information sharing within the external ecosystem of players (Hewett, Lehmacher,
    & Wang, 2019). The hybrid blockchain-based solution allows meeting the data integrity
    for the internal processes to provide traceability, data accuracy, visibility,
    security, and connected real-time data on the verification of quality parameters
    within the biopharmaceutical company. Once the internal validation is performed,
    the blockchain securely shares the relevant information with the external ecosystem.
    The conceptual solution is shown in Figure 3\. However, in the context of this
    chapter, emphasis is focused on the internal ecosystem in the first phase of the
    blockchain deployment. Thus, allowing to structure the concept in an agile and
    lean approach while having reduced complexities.

    with an enhanced adherence to compliance through data verification between parties.
    Within the internal ecosystem, blockchain technology can streamline the interactions
    across internal functions (e.g., Manufacturing, Quality Control, Quality Assurance).
    With the implementation of the blockchain in the internal ecosystem, trust is
    decentralized. Internally, the blockchain is configured to allow the data to be
    verified and shared through a validation strategy. Each step of the biopharmaceutical
    operations will be performed at the specific nodes of the blockchain in accordance
    with the business logic. Nodes that send data to the blockchain rely on the Proof
    of Authority (PoA) validation strategy as the internal network is private and
    nodes are aware of each other and their belonging to the network is pre-specified.
    Hence, nodes validate transactions based on their unique status inside the network
    based on the operational business logic. The value from blockchain technology
    in the biopharmaceutical industry will be driven with smart contracts, that can
    be set in place to automatize the processes of verification and cross-checking
    of information based on predefined parameters. It will allow the batches that
    are proceeding toward the market to be compliant, and at the same time, capture
    the non-conformance events by triggering the manual root cause analysis and investigation.
    Smart contracts would define the conformity range of the product and process with
    enhanced traceability and transparency towards higher compliance. The flow of
    data in the internal setting is shown in Figure 4\. Firstly, the flow covers the
    internal manufacturing unit operational information, that is transmitted into
    the blockchain. This information is related to the product in terms of supplier
    identification codes, corresponding raw material compositions and the linked batch
    of production. This first block allows an easier and trustable track and trace
    mechanism and a comprehensive set of information to be added to the blockchain
    for later inspection from other units. Then, the quality testing phase performed
    by Quality Control proceeds with the analysis of the sample batches, having its
    history in terms of composition and adding a second block with information related
    to the results of the testing activities, including the recording of all the equipment,
    personnel, and procedures that have to be captured according to the documentation
    guidelines. In this manner, data alteration is infeasible, and any changes and
    version history are easy to identify and check. This system enforces the consistency
    of the shared data by avoiding data manipulation and enhancing the audit verification
    process (both internally and externally).

    with selective data privacy, and on the other, it enhances the point-to-point

- en: Through the years, several companies, have shown their intention to commit to
    Blockchain. However, due to the complexities of the operational processes in the
    biopharmaceutical companies and the interactions involved in the distribution
    of medicinal products to finally reach patients, there are numerous challenges.
    From a broader perspective, several implementation challenges are related to the
    immature state-of-the-art of blockchain technology and the competitive based approach
    of companies. One major challenge is related to the lack of interoperability among
    different blockchain networks, which in most cases, retain standalone protocols,
    coding languages, consensus mechanisms and privacy measures in disagreement with
    each other. With the purpose to avoid this problem, a potential solution would
    relate to the setting of universal standards enabling different networks to communicate
    and allow companies to collaborate on the application development, validate proof
    of concept and share blockchain solutions. From a managerial point of view, a
    shift in organizational thinking is needed, as companies are only focused on developing
    their own networks to overcome competitors, implying the consequent creation of
    multiple blockchain standards with multiple differences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Concerning our conceptual case, the blockchain creates multiple opportunities
    to primarily benefit the biopharmaceutical Quality Control function and thereby
    internally extending it transversely to the various stakeholders. However, companies
    tend to struggle with the adoption of emerging technological paradigms: Some of
    the limiting factors for the blockchain adoption range from the immaturity and
    costs of the technology to the need of reaching an industry standard, and to the
    organizational readiness (Toufaily, Zalan, & Dhaou, 2021). Moreover, before blockchain
    adoption within the organization, the Information Technology backbone needs to
    be well-built in order to allow the intended benefits from the blockchain. Indeed,
    it is possible that some companies still rely on paper-based archives or are equipped
    with stand-alone and old generation machines that are not interconnected or produce
    analog data. Hence, the first step is to digitize and digitalize all the necessary
    steps to avoid bottlenecks due to the coexistence of digital and non-digital data.
    Connected instruments, Internet of Things (IoT) and similar industry 4.0 related
    investments must be sustained, prior to generating flows of data within all company
    laboratories and processes within the blockchain. An effective blockchain solution
    would thrive on such a technological ecosystem and unlock all the benefits intended
    by the technology. Digitally enabled QC laboratories would generally provide significant
    cost reductions. Just the reduction of paper usage by 80% provides an important
    tangible benefit to the Quality Control laboratories of the biopharmaceutical
    companies (Han, Makarova, Ringel, & Telpis, 2019), and have a positive impact
    on the environment towards the sustainability drivers. The current process sometimes
    involves manual data transcription and requires a second operator to validate
    the data. With the advent of blockchain, a fully automatic digital-enabled system
    would be set. Such change is crucial both in terms of productive efficiency, and
    to achieve sustainable performances and significant long-run cost reductions.
    On average, an automated Quality Control laboratory can cut costs by 25 to 45
    per cent, but still, there is a low tendency to approach new paths, also because
    of old paradigms retention among employees (Han et al., 2019).'

- en: Nevertheless, before an organization can respond to any type of technology disruption,
    it is important to understand the nature of that disruption. Digitally maturing
    companies are reimagining structures, resetting strategies, encouraging cross-sector
    collaborations, and opening new ways of working and doing businesses. Whereas,
    the remaining others that are mainly waiting at the window, would tend to lose
    huge opportunities (Deloitte, 2018). To overcome the technical and organizational
    challenges, the managers must plan and consider specific change management approaches
    to facilitate the transition to new technological paradigms such as the blockchain.
    The biopharmaceutical industry technology gap is not likely to immediately disappear
    because of a positive trend. In order to eliminate it, the organisation need to
    aim for future strategies by looking at the new organizational structures and
    cultural changes among all organizational members. Transformation is not only
    a problem of technology but above all, it concerns the ability of the organization
    and individuals to include innovative cultures in the mindset of each employee,
    i.e., from the top management level to the scientists and at the shop floor. Almost
    certainly, employees are attached to previous working success routines and may
    be reluctant to change in the future. Bringing blockchain technologies in the
    biopharmaceutical industry needs a change not only in terms of acquiring the technology,
    and its related competencies, but also a change in the management culture and
    its operational processes. Therefore, the introduction of a new technology into
    the day-to-day operations entails a company and industry-wide process of change,
    where collaboration among industry players and regulators is essential. To lead
    the company-wide changes, there is a need for structured managerial approaches.
    New technologies are disrupting the manner of doing business in many manufacturing
    industries, enhancing paces and overall requiring new cultural attitudes and change
    in the employee’s mindset. The organizations need to acknowledge this shift within
    the environment in order to build a sustainable future.

    ecosystems for the positioning of the blockchain technology in the healthcare
    sector using a modular setup. The scope is to allow a leaner technology implementation
    in order to address the current data integrity challenges in the internal siloed
    structures of the pharmaceutical company in order to increase transparency, trust,
    and coordination. This is to further extend the ecosystem to facilitate the track
    and trace necessities from regulators and bring this transparency through the
    patient. As a conceptual instantiation in this chapter, our concept is designed
    within one function (actor/stakeholder), i.e., by detailing the use of the blockchain
    in the biopharmaceutical quality control focusing on the data integrity aspect.

    the biopharmaceutical quality control operations as a conceptual case. The intention
    is to initiate the use of blockchain technology within the healthcare sector,
    even though much of the focus on the use of blockchain has been on the supply
    chain and distribution of medicinal products, due to the emerging regulatory guidelines.
    The paradigm of deploying the blockchain technology across multiple external stakeholders
    is highly challenging. Therefore, our concept focuses on a modular approach to
    address two important areas of the biopharmaceutical industry and healthcare system
    i.e. data integrity to increase transparency, trust, and coordination within the
    internal ecosystem of the biopharmaceutical company, and track and trace to facilitate
    transparency and authenticity of the medicinal products for the patients.

    question is addressed by reviewing the main benefit that the blockchain-based
    traceability could create for a company such as the authenticity of the data,
    efficiency, transparency, and security. The time perspective for the blockchain
    pursual will be important to have technology structuring, and its implementation
    leading to the tangible benefits at the right time. In the long run, the introduction
    of the Blockchain is all about enhancing trust. Currently, the biopharmaceutical
    industry suffers from an absence of trust between different participants (Han
    et al., 2019). Blockchain allows the decentralization of trust with a process
    that is immutable and highly reliable. The dependency of an intermediatory third
    party is eliminated, and the entire system is self-validating. Thus, reinvents
    the data management with a decentralized approach.'

- en: The deployment of our visionary blockchain concept within the biopharmaceutical
    industry will require an adequate strategy, that involves a phase appropriate
    management approach. Here, the digital innovation of introducing the blockchain
    is phase appropriately structured via a hybrid model that combines traditional
    Stage-Gated approaches - characterized by incremental phases (in terms of scale,
    costs, and resources with reduced risks) and Go-No/Go gates to evaluate the progress
    and have the option to disengage resources if the outcomes are not achieved or
    allow changing the scopes as by the evolving nature of benefits. The use of Agility
    Based approaches is to favour rapid sprints of development and frequent feedback
    on the product deliverable as a continuous adaptation to needs and contingencies
    arising during the innovation process. This practical strategy allows the pursuing
    of the change starting from a Proof-of-Concept phase, entailing the experimentation
    and development of a Minimum Viable Product, in order to prove the conceptual
    application of the blockchain in a sandboxed approach and gain confidence that
    the solution meets the intended business objectives. Thus, the Proof of Concept
    (PoC) phase sets the visionary forecast of the expected benefits envisioned as
    a justification to pursue the investment, for the second phase. Following the
    PoC, the Proof of Feasibility has the objective to develop the minimum viable
    product according to requirements and needs gathered more closely to the day-to-day
    working environment and testing it on a rolling basis. This phase is crucial to
    emphasize with the employee who will need to interact with the solution, so as
    to build, for example, all the peripheral features that are necessary to move
    the solution toward the full integration with the legacy IT system and gain acceptance
    from other employees and alignment with the legacy operational processes in the
    organization. In this second phase, the engagement of resources is increased in
    order to cover additional features following the needs of all the stakeholders.
    Proof of Feasibility provides real-world metrics on the benefit and performances
    of the solution, that can be monitored on an evolving basis and benchmarked with
    the initially envisioned benefits from PoC. The last and concluding phase is the
    Proof of Value phase, which seeks to bring the solution into routine operation
    and to fully integrate it into the business operations of the organization. This
    is just a visionary overview of the approach, that could be used to build digital
    innovations, such as the envisioned blockchain concept by strategically managing
    the systemic barriers. Of note, the cultural maturity towards the implementation
    of the blockchain is a vast topic on its own and relevant management strategies
    are needed to be planned specifically for the organization.
