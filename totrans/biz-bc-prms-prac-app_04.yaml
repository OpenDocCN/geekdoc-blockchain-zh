    by applying that technology. Startups are like a strange beast when it comes to

    of the mainframe computers in the late 1950s, but the term FinTech only became
    popular around 2013\. It is ironic that technology has always played a key role
    in a bank’s operations, yet one could argue that banks did not innovate much with
    the Internet. Traditionally, the IT focus at banks was oriented towards running
    back-end operations (including clients’ accounts and transactions), supporting
    branch retail functions, linking automated teller machines, processing payments
    from point-of-sale retail gateways, being globally interconnected with their partners
    or inter-banking networks, and delivering a variety of financial products ranging
    from simple loans to sophisticated trading instruments.

    front-end entry point for any service. However, most banks pushed back on that
    innovation window, because they were entrenched in delivering services inside
    their retail branches, or via one-on-one business relationships. They did not
    see the Web as a catalyst for bigger change, so they adapted the Internet at their
    own pace, and according to their own limited assumptions. Fast forward to 2016,
    more than 20 years into the Web’s commercialization, and one could argue that
    banks only gave their customers Internet banking (with mobile access later), online
    brokerage, and online bill payments. The reality is that customers are not going
    to the branch as often (or at all), and they are not licking as many stamps to
    pay their bills. Meanwhile, FinTech growth is happening; it was a total response
    to banks’ lack of radical innovation.

    bridges and ramps into incumbent banking institutions. As a side note, in 2014,
    ApplePay took a page from PayPal, and inserted itself once again between the banks
    and their customers by hijacking the point-of-sale moments via multipurpose smartphones.

    from start to finish on a peer-to-peer basis, without central intermediaries or
    clearinghouses in the middle. The counterparties did not need to know each other
    or require a third-party to intermediate the transaction. Decentralization and
    peer-to-peer transaction finality are key blockchain innovations that must be
    preserved in order to maximize the potential impact of blockchain implementations.
    Generically, the counterparties’ identities and reputations are automatically
    verified on the blockchain via wallet addresses or built-in AML/KYC (Anti-Money
    Laundering / Know Your Customer) attestations or collateral requirements. Then,
    the transaction terms are entered into a smart contract and published on the blockchain,
    while simultaneously storing the associated regulatory agreement (for example,
    an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement) on
    a decentralized peer-to-peer file distribution protocol (for example on the InterPlanetary
    File System). The last reporting step could be entered into a standard database
    performing compliance requirements, although the degree of P2P purity would be
    diminished if centralized databases are used.

    transactions that are processed by a blockchain will need to be recognized as
    legally binding and acceptable within compliance requirements. This might involve
    revisiting recordkeeping or compliance rules, or at least ensuring that new regulation
