    remarkable and unavoidable reminders of China’s urbanization project, and the
    never-ending process of building (and rebuilding). They thrive freely in big cities
    until the city government decides to eradicate them. During the winter of 2009,
    while Beijing’s urban villages still existed, I visited one that was adjacent
    to Yuan Ming Yuan, or the Old Summer Palace. It teemed with life, and poverty—kids
    playing badminton in the streets, piles of trash, stray dogs sniffing around,
    and hunks of meat hung to cure outside the entrance of a public restroom by someone
    taking advantage of scarce outdoor space. It was a rare affordable haven for migrants
    to the city who could not pay Beijing’s astronomical rents.

    city,” and these form as Chinese cities expand into or start to surround neighboring
    farmland. Eventually, the land is cleared for new skyscrapers, and the government
    compensates the farmers with housing and money. In the best scenario, peasants
    can become well-off landlords in the new cityscape. In the worst case, they end
    up with compensation so low that they cannot buy a new home.

    drivers. In Shenzhen, urban villages have played a key part in the city’s rise,
    nurturing new inventors with brash ideas and informal economies. Yet because of
    the socioeconomic status of the population residing in urban villages, these areas
    are deemed dangerous by upper-middle-class urbanites. The term that upper-middle-class
    Chinese people use to describe this population is “low-quality” (*disuzhi*, 低素质).
    Strangely, the upper-middle class seems to have no qualms about the low-quality
    population traveling to wealthier parts, watching over their children and cleaning

    crime has happened, who has committed it, and who we should watch out for. For
    example, we want to figure out who is making homemade drugs in this urban village.
    We are trying to get electricity usage per household, and sudden spikes in the

    complex logistical coordination, the brute force of cheap labor, and the availability
    of low-cost mobile phones. Gone are the days of riffling through vegetables at

    Everything from medicine to cooked meals and vegetables can now be delivered to
    you via Meituan, or scheduled to arrive at your door when you get home from work.

    specifically machine learning, in crunching the massive amount of location-based
    geographical data and historical traffic data in order to give the best predictions
    and driver instructions. Because of China’s “gladiator”-like tech scene, competition
    is tough—Meituan fought hard against Alibaba’s Ele.me delivery service. In the
    end, Meituan prevailed, keeping the cost of each delivery to 70 cents, and placing
    swap stations for its delivery fleet’s electric moped batteries across the city.

    health insurance. Each delivery earns RMB 4 on top of their base salary.

    Refusing to take an order after it is assigned in the system results in an RMB
    100 fine, and being too early for a delivery is a whopping RMB 500 fine. Although
    the base salary initially seems appealing, the long list of fines creates a precarious
    existence for the workers. It parallels gig work in the United States—DoorDash
    drivers and TaskRabbits. In both cases, the larger system, the platform, off-loaded
    any operating risk to the workers, allowing the platform to shirk responsibility
    to customers. Through fee structures of bonuses, fines, and competition to be
    courier of the month, work is gamified, just like in the United States.

    drove from a copper mine to a coal mine outside of Hulunbuir, watching straggly
    sheep herds in the waning grassland. He’s ethnically Mongolian, but his family

    Mongolia and Inner Mongolia as a territory of China. As an ethnic minority in
    China, he has a fraught relationship to the government. Early assimilationist
    policies, alongside forced resettlement of nomadic Mongolian herders into Han
    Chinese–built cities, has led to an erasure of Mongolian language and culture

    truly represent the full spectrum of life. It remains a thin slice of the world.
    There is always some kind of bias built in. Yet we imagine numbers to mean something,

    “quantifauxcation”: the attempt to assign numbers or quantify phenomenon, as if
    quantitative data can offer certainty.^([4](notes-ch6.xhtml#notes-ch6-4)) Some

    Xiaoli admits he can’t predict the future, but remains convinced that collecting

    to focus an overloaded police force. Paying extra attention to problem areas raises
    an observation bias in itself. The more patrols are assigned to a certain area,
    the more crimes are observed. And really, the numbers don’t mean much in themselves,
    except as markers of both how policing has replaced social welfare services and
    the corporate-style expectations of efficiency that are put on police officers.
    Xiaoli’s predictive policing reflects the circular logic that has become embedded

    Living against history can equally be applied to our understanding of data—“I
