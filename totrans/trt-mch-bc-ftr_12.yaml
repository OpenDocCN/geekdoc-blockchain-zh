- en: It’s hard for anyone to keep up with the frenetic pace at which cryptocurrency
    and blockchain development evolves. For an author, it can be downright exhausting.
    The rhythms of the community attached to this technology run on a cycle multiple
    times faster than those of the book publishing industry. It creates special challenges
    for those who write for the latter and leaves them dependent on a team of supporters
    who understand those challenges, are flexible with the constant demands for last-minute
    updates, and can put up with you when it all gets a bit stressful. In our case,
    the task was further complicated by the fact that each of us was engaged in a
    separate, unconnected book project while this one was under contract. So, in that
    spirit, we want to thank the many people who’ve helped us pull this project together.
    They are, as always, too numerous to name in full.

    who has continued to believe in us and has been a tireless supporter of our work.
    Gillian is a reliable source of good advice on all matters of life as an author.
    We count her as a vital business partner and friend.

    his business. Once again, he proved to be a tough, exacting editor, constantly
    pushing us to clarify our sometimes-hard-to-explain ideas. The book is immeasurably
    better for his tough love. He was also supremely generous in allowing for a flexible
    production time frame as the circumstances of both the story and our work schedule
    changed over time. Helping Tim was a big crew at St. Martin’s. They pulled this
    together within the tight time frame that our erratic work habits demanded. Among
    those deserving particular thanks are Tim’s assistant, Alice Pfeifer, who has
    been tremendously helpful in guiding us as we prepared the manuscript for production;
    Managing Editor Alan Bradshaw, who kept us on schedule; copy editor Jennifer Simington
    for her meticulous work; Associate Publisher Laura Clark, who has championed both
    of our books with SMP; and last but certainly not least, the one-two punch of
    publicist Katie Bassel and marketer Jason Prince.

    of the thinking behind this book, probably without knowing it. Special thanks
    go to Media Lab Director Joi Ito, Digital Currency Initiative Director Neha Narula,
    and my Sloan School co-lecturer Simon Johnson, as well as to Robleh Ali, Mark
    Weber, Tadge Dryja, Chelsea Barabas, Prema Shrikrishna, Alin Dragos, James Lovejoy,
    Sandy Pentland, Dazza Greenwood, Harvey Michaels, David Birnbach, and Christian
    Catalini. Also, a special shout-out to Brian Forde, the first director of the
    DCI, who is now aiming to bring blockchain technology into Congress and who convinced
    me to give up journalism for a life of academic research. Meanwhile, at CoinDesk,
    I’d like to thank Kevin Worth, Marc Hochstein, Pete Rizzo, and the rest of the
    team for giving me a new platform upon which to express my point of view. It has
    been fun getting my teeth back into journalism, albeit as a side-gig.
