    solution, not the entire solution itself. By this I mean that Blockchain itself
    does not in any way completely solve the issue of fraudulent suppliers within
    the supply chain model. Let's take olive oil producers for example; if I only
    want to buy specific olive oil – say from Tuscany – how can I make sure that the
    label on the bottle really does mean this oil is from Tuscany? In reality I can't,
    not without being at the orchard the olives are grown in, watching the oil getting
    pressed out of them and bottled before my eyes.

    a high level of immutability between records, if a supplier commits themselves

    control agent turns up at their door and finds out they are from Umbria instead,
    the entirety of the supply chain now knows this supplier is untrustworthy. Either
    the supplier will completely lose all business, or they will be forced to change
    the labelling on their bottle to reflect the oil's true origin.

    When I think about the applications of DLT, I see its evolution as a series of
    waves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first wave, which we are in the midst of now, involves the use of DLT as
    a transactional record. This was the purpose for which Blockchain was invented,
    and almost all of the current compelling use cases – trading networks, supply
    chain provenance, land registry, and indeed cryptocurrency itself – fall into
    this category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second wave will consist of use cases and business models that make full
    use of DLT's smart contract capabilities. We have seen some abortive forays into
    this realm already, but almost every major hack or breach in the DLT world to
    date has been due to poorly implemented smart contracts, and the main thing we
    have learned so far is that they are much harder to implement than they seem.
    Nevertheless, it seems likely that this is a problem that will be solved in short
    order, and that reliable smart contracts are going to yield business models in
    which humans will continue to be released from administrative and reconciliation
    tasks and be able to focus increasingly on higher value and more customer facing
    activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third wave, and to my mind the one with the most transformational potential,
    will come when DLT can be reliably used not only as a method of sharing transactional
    data and contractual terms, but of executable code itself. This will have far-ranging
    implications. In the realm of security, the ability to perform a consensus check
    to validate a block of code will render ineffective almost all of the hacking
    exploits currently in use. With regards to interoperability, DLT applications
    will be able to seamlessly apply bug fixes or feature upgrades on their own ledgers,
    vastly reducing both cost and risk of deployment, as well as eliminating the support
    nightmare of users running lagged versions. With regard to piracy, it will virtually
    eliminate all current methods of counterfeiting. Within 10 years, I predict that
    DLT will underlie the deployment mechanism for at least 90% of all software applications,
    both business and consumer. And for many of the same reasons, it seems likely
    that DLT will underpin the distribution of most media products – music, movies,
    games – as well.

    or the internet. Today, we don't engage in long conversations and debates about
    TCP/IP, how we can use it and what it is best for. We no longer care about downloading,
    emailing, or storing large amounts of data. We expect to get internet access in
    every coffee shop, airport, or restaurant, not caring at all what Wi-Fi technology
    is, how it works, and what it is useful for. I envision a future where we use
    Blockchain technology without knowing we are using it.

    vote was really accounted for the party I voted for and politicians are both accountable
    and transparent; an anywhere banking system where I can get a loan from a bank
    in Japan to buy a house in Spain while I am living in Nicaragua; an integrated
    global registry to exchange value, property, assets, and ownership in a matter
    seconds between peers without information asymmetries.  ## Future of Blockchain

    ubiquitous throughout your normal day. What do I mean by this? I mean it will
    be similar to using your smartphone today, the first phones let you make calls
    but nowadays we use it to consume entertainment, socially connect to others, guide
    us when we get lost, listen to music, and occasionally we might even call someone!

    or business on the other side of the globe instantly; you won''t think about foreign
    exchange, and the transaction fee will be negligible. You''ll be able to auction
    your unwanted items or bid on things others no longer need and it will seem crazy
    people were paying eBay large amounts of fees, fees to list, fees to be paid,
    and fees to transfer money. You''ll get into your taxi and not even think about
    how the driver no longer has prices set and fees deducted by a platform such as
    Uber instead of the decentralized autonomous organization you''re both using.
    Think it sounds fanciful? There are already services to replace social networks
    and Uber and we are still in the early days. Simple everyday things will become
    seamless, you will have far better control over your data, and you won''t even
    think about the Blockchain behind it.  ## Future of Blockchain Summary'

- en: After reading through my contributors, views on the future of Blockchain technology,
    it is clear to see that we have only just started this journey. As I have said
    previously, Peter and Paolo also refer to the fact that we are still at the beginning
    of the journey – in the ‘hype’ phase, but moving rapidly towards real organizational
    benefits using Blockchain technology.

    adoption cycle, and we will not know we are using the technology when it is a
    successful technology.

    you can start to implement these in your organizations now. My advice is to ‘get
    stuck in’ and start to understand how the Blockchain revolution will change your
    organization, and your life, forever.
