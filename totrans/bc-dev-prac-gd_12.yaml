    and help you see what’s possible in the coming years from the blockchain technology.
    Crypto paved the way by providing an alternative to fiat currency with the introduction
    of bitcoin. Although the invention of bitcoin was more than a decade ago (it was
    introduced in 2008), blockchain is still in its infancy. However, it’s poised
    to potentially become one the most useful technological innovations of the 21st
    century.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that said, the road for technological integration and adoption by the masses
    is still long and bumpy, and blockchain has already experienced multiple ups and
    downs, driven by financial speculation, security, performance, trust, scalability,
    and regulation (not to mention crypto attacks from charlatans and hackers). These
    concerns have caused many to become skeptics. Despite all this, blockchain cannot
    be ignored. It has the potential to improve all industries and become as big of
    a globalized technological innovation as the Internet or the fax machine.

- en: The potential of blockchain has been recognized by many, and in fact, in 2019
    alone, companies are expected to invest more than $3 billion in blockchain technologies.
    By examining the current projects in development, the bigger picture shows that
    cryptocurrency is not the final frontier but just the beginning, because many
    blockchain projects are expanding beyond just cryptocurrency and disrupting more
    than just fiat currencies.

    their systems in one way or another. Hundreds of startups are slowly entering
    the mainstream, the potential utilization of blockchain technology seems limitless,
    and in many cases, blockchain opens up new potential revenue streams and new business
    models.

    the publishers and investors of these coins. However, the capabilities of creating
    coins and using blockchain as a cryptocurrency to make payments globally quickly
    and for low costs have inspired many. The crypto use cases highlight blockchain
    reliability as it’s able to replace fiat currency.

    have heard of crypto, but it is not considered mainstream just yet. But in this
    section you’ll see there are projects in the works that can push the usage of
    coins into mainstream use. For instance, in December 2018, media outlets reported
    that Facebook is developing a “stablecoin” for its WhatsApp users and is holding
    talks with exchanges about listing its stablecoin, which will be tied “to a basket
    of different foreign currencies, rather than just the dollar.” Adoption by Facebook,
    which is used by a large portion of the population, will raise more awareness

    digital balance of a certain asset. For instance, bitcoin is a cryptographic token
    because it uses a digital signature in conjunction with ownership; however, not
    all cryptographic tokens are cryptocurrencies.

    in nature, NFT is a special cryptographic token that represents something unique.
    These tokens are not interchangeable because they cannot be replaced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both NFT and utility tokens use a tokenization process that allows you to create
    a *security*. The security takes the digital asset and fractionalizes its ownership
    by creating digital tokens. Each token then represents a percentage of ownership
    in the asset. The use of blockchain makes the chain of custody and proof of ownership
    immutable, which gives an advantage to certain applications as the information
    cannot be altered like in a regular database.

    For instance, the Kik messaging app ( [https://www.kik.com](https://www.kik.com)
    ) turned its company into a digital asset and started selling tokens that represent
    a fraction of ownership in its company. Kik was able to raise $100 million that
    can now be used to grow its platform. What it has done is a reverse ICO; instead
    of raising funds prior to creating the company, it is selling a portion of the
    company after it’s already up and running, just as a company can “go public” in
    the stock market.

    pay phones and trains used tokens; these token have no value other than the context
    of using them in a pay phone or the train station but not anywhere else. The dollar
    also used to be tied to the amount of gold that the government kept in vaults,
    so when you held dollars prior to 1971, you used to own a token in the gold the
    U.S. government kept in its vaults. Similarly, today, stablecoin tokens represent
    fiat currency such as DAI, GUSD, TUSD, USDC, and USDT tokens created with the
    use of Ethereum. These tokens are based on companies placing fiat currency in
    an escrow account and registering their company with regulators.

    to place your trust in a single entity with your valuable information or digital
    assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With blockchain, the data storage itself can become decentralized. P2P networks
    such as PirateBay, Limelight, and others have proven capable of stitching pieces
    of data together from different computers around the globe to store digital assets
    such as video, music, images, and software. Although many of these P2P networks
    are in violation of copyright Material and considered illegal in many countries,
    a blockchain P2P network can share files by legitimate publishers while limiting
    access to authorized customers. Blockchain works in a similar way to these P2P
    networks and can be used to store any data. In fact, Storj ( [https://storj.io/](https://storj.io/)
    ) and Sai ( [https://sia.tech](https://sia.tech) ) are examples of cloud storages
    based on blockchain aimed at improving security, reducing costs, and decreasing
    dependency. Users can rent out their storage capacity when not in usage, creating

    eliminating the need for a third party to be involved in the arrangement. Utilizing
    smart contracts for legal concerns can potentially become a better alternative
    to paper as they are stable, honest, and less prone to human errors. Using a smart
    contract, the middleman is not needed (middlemen can be attorneys, escrow agents,
    notaries, bankers, loan officers, and so on).

    instance, Slock.it created payments for renting usable devices; these devices
    can be any object such as bikes, cars, or even toolboxes. Similarly, Fizzy ( [https://fizzy.axa/](https://fizzy.axa/)
    ) tracks flight delays and automatically refunds passengers when flights are delayed.
    These services are done automatically; you don’t need to stand in lines or be
    passed along by phone representatives from one department to another. Additionally,
    these refunds can occur automatically. These contracts are saving the user and
    the businesses time, effort, and money. Additionally, customer service is improved,
    and as these services are automated, this can reduce the number of employees you

    revolutionize digital identities by using cryptography to secure them. This is

    infiltrate the market, publish work, and access the top music streaming platforms.
    Once an artist reaches the large streaming platforms such as Pandora, Spotify,
    and so on, they can access 250 million customers; however, many artists are unhappy
    with the payment structure and the time it takes to get paid. For instance, a
    song on Spotify would need more than 152,000 playbacks from premium users to be
    able to generate a mere revenue of $100 to the artist. The majority of the money
    goes to a long list of intermediary middlemen. Not only do artists get paid very
    little, it sometimes takes years to get these payouts.
