    cross-sector applicability are summarized in this chapter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The blockchain is built on a unique set of properties, including decentralization,
    tamper-resistance, transparency, security, and smart contracts. Because there
    is no central authority to control the system, it is very resistant to single-point
    faults. The records in a blockchain are tamper proof in this regard since it is
    extremely difficult to alter or delete transaction records. All transactions in
    public or open blockchains are transparent and observable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All transactions are timestamped, which implies that information like payment
    details, contracts, ownership transfers, and so on are publicly connected to a
    certain date and time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there are still a number of unresolved difficulties, such as public
    blockchains’ restricted scalability and performance, which is primarily due to
    low transaction volumes or excessive power consumption when using existing PoW
    consensus techniques. Other concerns include the possibility of a majority of
    participants colluding to infiltrate the network, as well as the network’s significant
    reliance on a small number of players.

    to the production of commons the greater the likelihood that the platform will
    polarize toward market logics in which *extrinsic* motivations to action prevail
    or at least significantly distort the *intrinsic* motivations to the logics of
    the community. This is the case for example of Backfeed, an innovative decentralized
    commons production platform based on blockchain, which provides sophisticated
    functionality to develop incentives associated with financing outside the user
    community and expressed through cryptocurrencies that can be spent toward other
    goods. In this way, participants are aggregated and coordinated according to a
    mechanism similar to that of exchanges based on individual interest.

    tokens should be “minted” within the community with an exchange value between
    the benefits of the same common or of different common that could be determined
    based on the amount/time of work required for their production/utilization. The
    information regarding the origin of the value (work) would be recorded, in an
    unmodifiable way (unless of course rather complex hacking activities) in the token
    data which could be accepted and increased in value according to the preferential
    priority of the request.

    cryptocurrency. Vittorio grows and sells apples and needs to have tokens to buy
    water. Antonio owns tokens for water while Francesco has tokens for visiting museums.
    Suppose that collecting apples and water takes the same time, while visiting the
    museum of the place takes half the time it takes to produce the first two. Antonio’s
    exchange has priority because Vittorio, as an apple grower and seller, prefers
    tokens to buy water. While in fact Antonio only needs to spend one token to get
    an apple, Francis must first spend two of his tokens to buy the water token from
    Antonio, then he can spend his water token to compare the apple from Francis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mechanism would create an additional demand for two water tokens (by Vittorio
    and Francesco) that correspond to the offer of two museum tokens (by Francesco)
    and an apple (by Vittorio). This would increase the value of water tokens by increasing
    the community’s interest in preserving the resource.

    as all behaviors that are admittedly consistent with the common goal are subject
    to peer-to-peer evaluation, which further determines the actual perceived value
    of the network/community. We also note how this type of transaction validation
    protocol is based on a sort of proof of value (Proof of value) instead of on the
    solution of a mathematical puzzle (Proof of Work), as occurs in the so-called
    mining activities of the Bitcoin blockchain, with obvious savings in terms of

    of the lack of communication between those who share the resources, can be rejected
    and the breadth of the telematic network can extend the scale of cooperation far
    beyond the simple local level. Obviously, even for blockchain, as for any other
    telematic activity, it is not possible to completely avoid the risks associated
    with the improper use of sensitive data, their general protection and their sovereignty,
    which can significantly inhibit the effective dissemination of this. technology.
  prefs: []

    be functional to the qualitative resolution of the decision coordination problems
    implied by the use of common resources.

    solution provided by blockchain is of real help to the construction of a self-organized
    ecosystem, capable of leading to a “happy resolution of conflicts” on common goods.

    of clients. There are several ways to organize servers. Iterative servers directly
    handle requests and respond to clients. Concurrent servers do not handle the request
    directly, but pass it on to a separate thread/process, after which they wait for
    the next request.

    the port of competence of a particular server, it activates it. There are UNIX
    services that do this job. And it is worth using a superserver only toward servers

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    client’s requested service. It merely responds by sending the requested data.
    If it stores something related to the past, it is not something necessary for
    the processing of the requested service. The web server is an example of a stateless
    server. In this case, if you need to keep status information, you are forced to
    keep it in the client (as a web or HTTP cookie).
  prefs: []

    of the requested service, for each connected client. For example, a file server
    needs to maintain the status of requests in progress from each client to prevent
    concurrent writes to the same file by two different clients.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Middleware is a software layer placed between the operating system and the architectural
    layer. It can provide transparency regarding access to data. For example a client
    written in C, which must interact with a server written in Java. The Java virtual
    machine ensures a homogeneous definition of an integer data.

    in general it has different structures for different hardware systems. Just as
    the format between Little Endian hardware systems can differ from Big Endian systems.
    Middleware can address these differences regarding data access. But it can also
    provide other services, such as a common API to program other services.
