    as the exchange of value always required two unknown people to trust each other’s
    claims. Even today, we need a common system, which can provide order to the society,
    keep track of our transactions, establish public trust in it, and maintain it
    forever.

    that could, in principle, represent almost anything – money, digital stocks, cryptocurrencies,
    or any other asset. Blockchain can follow instructions to buy or sell these assets
    and implement inclusive set of terms and conditions through so-called smart contracts.

- en: Blockchain differs from a simple ledger in that all transactions are stored
    in multiple copies on independent computers, individually within a decentralized
    network, rather than managed by a centralized institution, such as a bank or government
    agency. Once a consensus is reached, all computers on the network update their
    copies of the ledger simultaneously. If a node attempts to retroactively add or
    subtract an entry without consensus, the rest of the network automatically invalidates
    the entry.

    and impregnable cryptography that adds a layer of integrity to the ledger, what
    Ian Grigg (2005) referred to as triple-entry accounting – one entry on the debit
    side, another on the credit side, and a third on an immutable, undisputed, shared
    ledger.

    protocol that allows simultaneous access, verification and updating of records
    in an irreversible manner over a network spanning multiple entities or locations.
    Blockchain is one of its many forms – Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), Hashgraph,
    Holochain, or Tempo (Radix). It is a sequence of blocks containing a complete
    list of transactions in the form of a digital public ledger that is replicated
    and distributed throughout the network. The blockchain ecosystem includes blocks
    – the data structure used to keep records of transactions, which are distributed
    among all nodes in the network, and nodes – a user or computer that holds a complete
    copy of the record or ledger.

    in 1991\. However, Satoshi Nakamoto, a person who goes by the alias, popularized
    it in 2008 to operate as the public transaction ledger of Bitcoin. Over the past
    one decade and a half, there have been innovations around blockchain consensus
    mechanisms, constitutional design, programmable smart contracts, and tokens. Blockchain
    1.0 applications were mainly limited to digital currencies, which were used in
    commercial transactions, foreign exchange, gambling, and money laundering. The
    expansion of Blockchain 2.0 applications enabled smart-contracts, decentralized
    applications (dApps), and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). Blockchain
    3.0 was able to register its presence in areas, such as education, health, science,
    transportation, and logistics in addition to currency and finance, and now Blockchain
    4.0 is evolving as a business-friendly ecosystem for the world of commons. The
    integration of blockchain with emerging technologies like Internet of Things,
    cloud, artificial intelligence, and robotics is one of the biggest promises of
    the times to come.

    A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain in which any user, whosoever
    wishes to transact with the network, can participate and write on the blockchain.
    A private blockchain only allows nodes coming from a specific organization to
    participate in the consensus process. That’s why it is also called permissioned
    blockchain. A consortium blockchain is a semi-private system in which a group
    of like-minded companies leverage cross-company solutions to improve workflow,
    accountability, and transparency.

- en: Blockchain, irrespective of its type, uses an asymmetric cryptography mechanism
    to validate the authenticity of transactions. It is basically a network of participants
    that share nodes for common business purpose and process. Each block of the blockchain
    contains about 1 MB of data. This block stores the information chronologically
    until its 1 MB data capacity is occupied, and then the second block repeats the
    same process. All these blocks join in a sequence, and to do this, each block
    gets a unique hash that exactly matches the string of data in that block. If anything
    inside a block changes, even to a little extent, the block gets a new hash.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a blockchain, this hash is created by a cryptographic hash function. A cryptographic
    hash function is a complex algorithm that takes any string of input and turns
    it into a 64-digit string of output. A hash is not always qualified. A block on
    the blockchain will only be accepted if its hash starts with at least ten consecutive
    zeros. A small, specific piece of data is added to each block called a nonce.
    The process of repeatedly altering and hashing a block’s data to find a suitable
    hash is called mining, and this is what miners do. Miners spend a lot of electricity
    in the form of computational power by constantly changing the block structure
    (nonce) and hashing it until a qualified signature (output) is found. The more
    computational power they have, the faster they can hash different block compositions
    to find a qualified hash.

    of alphanumeric values (hash), is called encryption. There are mainly two types
    of encryption – asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption, depending on whether
    the same or different keys are used for encryption and decryption. Cryptocurrencies
    use blockchain to achieve the benefits of a public ledger as well as an advanced
    cryptographic security system so that online transactions are always chronicled
    and secure. Transactions are simply data that indicate the flow of cryptocurrency
    from one wallet to another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to record the flow of currency or data from one wallet to another in
    an immutable form, nodes communicate with one another to reach consensus on the
    records of the ledger. However, the transaction is accepted only if majority of
    the nodes agree on its validity. When all nodes reach a consensus, transactions
    are recorded on a new block and added to the existing chain. While Bitcoin focused
    on decentralized payments, Vitalik Buterin and his collaborators introduced arbitrary
    computer code into the blockchain using transactions. Thus, Ethereum came into
    being as a peer-to-peer network where each node runs an operating system called
    the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This securely executes and verifies application
    code, hitherto called smart contracts, and allows participants on the blockchain
    to transact with each other without a trusted central authority.

    such as conditional transfer of digital assets, multisig asset exchange, or waiting
    for a specific amount of time to execute a transaction. It allows the creation
    of decentralized applications for B2C trades whereas B2B transactions, which need
    to keep their data secure and confidential, can adopt Hyperledger. Hyperledger
    offers a modular architecture that delivers a high degree of privacy, resilience,
    and scalability. It is an enterprise-level private blockchain network that enables
    several business entities – such as banks, corporate institutions or trade establishments
    – to transact with each other.

    his rights and responsibilities. Over the centuries, governments around the world

    of time, they became a de facto national identification number. In order to provide
    an official identity to every citizen of India, the Department of Information
    Technology, Government of India, introduced a biometric-enabled, unique identification
    number (UID). This project has listed over a billion users with an estimated expenditure
    of 130 billion INR, till date (UIDAI, 2022). India’s Unique Identification System,
    called Aadhaar, has been taken as a case study to deliberate over the advantages
    and disadvantages of a centralized identity model in light of privacy issues,
    unconstitutional access, absence of data-protection laws, involvement of private

    and enable them to have hassle-free access to government schemes and public services,
    but the ground reality has been far from such claims. First of all, the technological
    framework for such a large database is not available in the country; and second,
    the Indian bureaucracy is not technically smart enough to handle such big data
    with burgeoning privacy and data-security issues in India. Also, the lack of interoperability
    between departments and government levels takes a toll in the form of excess bureaucracy,
    which, in turn, increases processing time and cost.

    of millions of users on a centralized government database, supported by some legacy
    software, with numerous single points of failure (SPoF). Such a centralized system,
    containing PII, acts like a honeypot to hackers. Following the reports of prevalent
    data breaches and continuing threats to online data over the past decade, the
    security of digital identities has emerged as one of the foremost concerns on
    the national front. Today, a user has to juggle various identities associated
    with his username across different websites. There is no consistent or homogenous
    way to use the data generated by one platform on the other. The most threatening
    and frustrating experience is that a digital identity arises organically from
    the personal information available on the web or from the shadow data created
    by a user’s online activities, on a day-to-day basis. The fragile links between
    digital and offline identities make it relatively easy to create pseudonymous

    and service providers that big data is never stored in a single repository, rather
    distributed among decentralized databases. Users, without being physically present,
    can share their digital ID with the service provider through a personal device,

    devices backed by IPFS, making them safe from data breaches. No transaction of
    user’s information would occur without the explicit consent of the user. It will
    permit the user to control his personally identifiable information, make the system
    more interoperable, allow the user to employ data on multiple platforms, and protect
    the user from being locked into one platform. Thus, blockchain would allow people
    to enjoy self-sovereign and encrypted digital identities, replacing the need for
    creating multiple usernames and passwords.

    people holding multiple cards for specific purposes. A single ID (*One World –
    One Identity*) comprising 20 digits could be provided to all on the day of census.
    The Digital ID System (IPFS/Private Ledger) would record all substantive data

    details, photo, biometric details, digital signature, educational progress, employment
    details, driver’s license, financial details, passport, visa, medical records,
    etc. in a distributed ledger like blockchain. While millions of transactions are
    recorded across hundreds of nodes scattered over thousands of financial institutions,
    notwithstanding any geographical or political boundaries; likewise, all identity
    documents from different administrative organizations can be recorded using a
    private key (Garg, 2019, 2021). The difference between a private key and a public
    key is that a private key, also called a secret key, is a variable that can be
    used to both encrypt and decrypt data, whereas a public key is a big numerical
    number that can only be used to encrypt data.

    been several milestones in the history of cryptography that led to the formation
    of the fundamentals of modern algorithms. In early times the cipher was the fundamental
    component for communicating secret messages, which included letters as a basic
    element. A few of its variants include Simple Substitution Cipher, Caesar Cipher,
    Vigenere Cipher, Transposition Cipher, Playfair Cipher, and Hill Cipher. In addition,
    many cryptographic algorithms, such as the RSA algorithm, Multiple Precision Arithmetic
    Library, GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, Chinese Remainder Theorem,

    of the individual. Consequently, a banker and a customer, sitting on two sides
    of the globe, can automate the transfer of money on their decentralized software,
    thanks to cryptography and smart contracts that run on Ethereum. Distributed record-keeping
