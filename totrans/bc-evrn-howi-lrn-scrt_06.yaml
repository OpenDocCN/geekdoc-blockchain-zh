    to describe it, like “hunormgous” or “gigantitanic.” It is so colossal that it
    can actually rain inside the building. Today it was raining dollar bills.

    they’re all floating down from the ceiling. I’m sure the organizers of this stunt
    imagined a mob of hungry convention-goers chasing the money—real money!—amid a
    riot of publicity.

    off the floor and showering it back over the attendees, giving them a second chance.
    Most mascots smile; this one was angry. It looked like a hemorrhoid.

    one deal to pay for the booth.” He was the eternal optimist, exactly what you

    to talk. “A thousand dollars!” Pete repeated. “Can you imagine buying Apple stock
    at $100, then having it be worth $1,000 in just a couple of years? How high do
    you think this can go?”

- en: The year is 2010\. Satoshi is still involved, and his bitcoin community of geeks
    and freaks is starting to coalesce. It occurs to one of these early enthusiasts—a
    fellow named Laszlo Hanyecz—that if bitcoin is to be used as digital money, someone
    needs to use it to buy something in real life.
  prefs: []

    delivered to his home. Another bitcoin user, Jeremy Sturdivant, takes him up on
    the challenge, little suspecting the historic nature of that experiment.
