- en: As logistics companies continue to expand due to the revolution of Logistics
    4.0, the complexity of the multiple connected organizations makes it impossible
    for a clear view of logistics operation. Since customer information is shared
    between companies, unauthorized access to personal information is inevitable,
    and it poses several threats to customers. To address this challenge, blockchain
    with some fascinating properties like enhanced security and transparency will
    be deployed. Blockchain is a technology that can be used to improve efficiency,
    visibility, and security in logistics management. This chapter will explore the
    current applications of blockchain in logistics management based on an analysis
    of the findings of several scholars. The change from traditional logistics to
    digital logistics, digital logistics issues, as well as blockchain principles,
    this study also provides useful insights into how blockchain can disrupt conventional
    operations in logistics management. It also lays the groundwork for future study
    into blockchain's applicability in digital fleet management.

    keep expanding but a lot of challenges confront its operations such as a lack
    of operation visibility from beginning to end due to enormous multiple agents
    involved within the logistics management framework, Increasing complexity in supply
    chains has made it difficult for logistics companies to identify the root cause
    of problems, thereby hindering the organization from taking fast and reliable
    decision. Traditional logistics management information systems have flaws like
    lack of openness, security issues, and unreliable ((Wang, Y., Hugh Han, 2019),
    unauthorized disclosure of personal information is the order of the day as information
    are shared and transferred between the logistics enterprises thereby resulting
    in to increase in frauds and other social vices during the operational process.
    The engagement of Blockchain which is innovation will offer solutions to these

    the requirements for the objects, the people, physical products, as well as for
    services, information, and energy. (Wannenwetsch, H. (Ed.), 2014) Objects must
    be delivered at the right time, at the right quantity, at the right cost, and
    in the right place. Alternatively, logistics management can be defined as establishing
    an organized and methodical network between a company and its suppliers to produce
    and sell a specific product to the end-user (CSCMP, 2018), to lower costs, and
    remain competitive. There is an interaction among processes, data, and information
    flows, as well as people, entities, and other resources. Simply put, the logistics
    management process involves all stages of bringing a product from its initial
    state to its final destination beginning with the transformation of raw materials
    into manufactured products, warehouse storage, market movement, and distribution
    to the final customer as shown in fig 1.

    ensures that manufacturers supply goods on a consistent and continuous basis.
    Great planning is needed to actualize this that is the reason the process has
    now become a vital aspect of logistics management. Despite the need for manufacturers
    to operate efficiently, the demand for the product is not equal to the supply
    because of the same imbalance that has previously been discussed. In such cases,
    storing extra items produced requires additional storage units and warehouses.
    Material handling equipment is needed to move materials around inside a warehouse
    as well as to load and unload items into and out of delivery vehicles, as well
    as sophisticated storage equipment like racks or shelving. Materials handling
    is a process that includes utilizing manual, semi-automated, and computerized
    equipment and frameworks to assist logistics and keep supply chain operations
    running smoothly. By doing so, forecasting, resource allocation, production planning,
    inventory reduction, customer service, and support are improved. Planning is a
    key component of logistics management, as it helps synchronize the various operations

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An Individual or organization can join the network and a copy of the distributed
    ledger to be shared All of the transactions are in chronological order on this
    copy. A peer-to-peer network node is used to carry out transactions. A set of
    digital data or transactions is represented by a “hash” identifier in each block
    of the ledger. The initial block in the chain is called the genesis block. A miner
    is a person who creates and validates blocks in the Bitcoin network. After being
    validated by miners, the digital transaction is added to the distributed ledger.
    As fresh blocks are added to the chain's end, the digital ledger continues to
    grow (Fang, W, Chen, 2020).

- en: Different types of Blockchain exist depending on the networks (J. d. Kruijff
    and H., 2017), and the network designs differ depending on how transactions are
    carried out and how quickly users can access data. Blockchain networks are classified
    in general based on the model and consensus employed. Different kinds of Blockchain
    that exist are namely public, private, and hybrid Blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Public Blockchain: Designed to eliminate the middleman, this kind of Blockchain
    is accessible to anyone with a computer and Internet connection. Where a completely
    decentralized transaction is required, public Blockchain is the best option. The
    Bitcoin Blockchain, as well as others such as Ethereum, IOTA, and others, are
    examples of some public Blockchain only allow for reading and writing. Bitcoin,
    for instance, employs an open-source methodology that allows anybody to contribute.
    The computation power and capacity required to carry out such a task duplicate
    transactions make this public Blockchain slow and resource-intensive, but they
    are extremely secure (Pinto R, 2019).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Private Blockchain: A corporation establishes a permission network in which
    all participants are recognized and trusted. In a private Blockchain, the networking
    system is password-protected. Participants must receive an invitation or authorization
    before they can participate. Administrators can selectively allow nodes to verify.
    When the Blockchain is used amongst organizations that are part of the same legal
    entity, this is advantageous. Faster transaction speeds, data/content privacy,
    and centralized control over who has access to the Blockchain are just a few of
    the benefits of adopting a private Blockchain. local business and governance frameworks
    are better suited to the private Blockchain. Governments may use a private Blockchain
    to conduct vote polls, saving billions of dollars in the process since these mechanisms
    make voting entirely secure and resistant to corruption (Thompson C, 2016). The
    financial services sector is home to a large number of private Blockchain-based
    applications for instance private Blockchain technology is being tested by Bank
    of America, JPMorgan Chase, the New York Stock Exchange, and Fidelity Investments
    as an alternative to paper-based and manual transaction processing (Iansiti M,
    Lakhani K, 2017).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Hybrid Blockchain: The benefits of both public and private Blockchains are
    combined in this Blockchain. Hybrid Blockchain combines a public Blockchain (in
    which all participants are included) with a private network (permission-based
    or invitation-only) that limits participation. A hybrid Blockchain can help highly
    regulated businesses and governments. This innovation gives users more freedom
    and control over which data is kept private and which data is published publicly.
    In the real world, there are numerous examples of hybrid Blockchain. For example,
    Xin-Fin is a hybrid Blockchain that combines Ethereum (a public Blockchain) and
    Quorum (a private Blockchain) (a private Blockchain). More than a dozen pilot
    projects in supply chain logistics, aviation, international trade, and financial
    settlements have been completed by XinFin. Ramco Systems, a multibillion-dollar
    software company, provides Xin-Fin hybrid Blockchain solutions to its clients
