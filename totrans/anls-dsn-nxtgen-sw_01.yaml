- en: Since the beginning of systems development, analysts and designers have essentially
    adhered to an approach that requires the interview of users, creating logical
    models, designing them across a network and developing the product. We have gone
    through for sure different generations, particularly with the coming of client/server
    systems where we first had to determine what software would reside on the server
    and what made more sense to stay on the client. A lot of those decisions had to
    do with systems performance capabilities. Once the Internet became the foundation
    of application communications and functionality, server technology became the
    preferred method of designing systems because of version controls and distribution
    across new devices. Unfortunately, these generations led us to creating a cyber
    Frankenstein monster. Although security in the mainframe system remains fairly
    secure, the distributed products across the internet were not designed with enough
    security. Indeed, the consequences of the lack of security focus has launched
    the dark web and the crisis of cyber exposures throughout the world. Our Frankenstein
    monster has created problems beyond our wildest imaginations, affecting not just
    our systems, but our moral fabric, our laws, our war strategy, and most of all
    our privacy. As with the Frankenstein novel, the monster cannot be easily destroyed,
    if at all—such is our challenge. Bottom line, our existing systems, based on central
    databases and client server mentality cannot protect us, and never will.

    first must require the unravelling of the monster. This means that all existing
    systems must be replaced with a new architecture that no longer solely depends
    on user input, and must be designed to consider what consumers might want in the
    future and to always consider security exposure. Next Generation Analysis and
    Design then is a book that takes on this seemingly overwhelming task of the rebuilding
    of our legacy applications, integration of our new digital technologies, and a
    security focus that ensures our networks can maximize protection of those that
    use them. The good news is that we are on the horizon of getting the new tools
    and capabilities in which this mission can be accomplished, notwithstanding how
    long it might take. These capabilities start with the coming of 5G in 2019, which
    will enable networks to perform at unprecedented speeds. This performance enhancement
    will drive significant proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) which in turn
    will require the creation of massive networks. These networks will need maximum
    security. To maximize security protection our systems will need to move away from
    the central database client/server paradigm towards a more ledger-based and object-oriented
    distributed network that are based on blockchain architecture and cloud interfaces.
    In order to address the latency exposure of blockchain architecture, some form
    of quantum computing will be needed. This book will provide an approach or roadmap
    to accomplishing this transition, particularly the redesign of existing legacy
    systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the Internet emerged as a game-changing technology, many felt that this
    era would be known as the Internet Revolution. As digital started to become a
    common industry cliché, it seemed more certain that “Internet” might be replaced
    by “Digital.” However, upon further analysis, I believe that this revolution will
    be known historically as the “Consumer” Revolution. The question is why? It appears
    that the real effects of the internet and the coming of digital technologies has
    created a population of smart consumers, that is, consumers who understand how
    technology affords them a more controlling piece of the supply and demand relationship.
    Indeed, the consumer is in control. The results should be obvious; consumer preferences
    are changing at an accelerated rate and causing suppliers to continually provide
    more options and more sophisticated products and services. As a result, businesses
    must be more agile and “on demand” in order to respond to what Langer ([2018](#CR4))
    referred to as Responsive Organizational Dynamism (ROD ), defined as the measurement
    of how well organizations respond to change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This consumerization in the digital era means that analysis and design will
    need to originate more from a consumer perspective. This means that analysts must
    expand their requirements gathering beyond the internal user community and seek
    a greater portion based on consumer needs and more importantly buying habits.
    Let’s examine this point further. The most significant shift in creating new software
    applications will not only be based on current user needs, but future consumer
    trends. This represents new cycles of demand in the consumer market. The new demand
    is based on the close relationship between consumer business needs and home use
    of digital products and services. From a design perspective, business and home
    requirements must be blended seamlessly—the ultimate representation of digital
    life in the 21st century!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But consumerization of technology requires a much more significant leap in design;
    predictive analytics driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
    (ML) for example. For it is AI and ML that will give us the ability to predict
    future consumer behavior using a more robust and automated paradigm. Thus, systems
    must be designed to evolve, just like living forms. In other words, applications
    must contain what I call *architectural agility*. The first step in architectural
    agility, is to apply digital re-engineering. The world of application development
    can only be accomplished by creating enormous object libraries that contain functional
    primitive operations (Langer [1997](#CR2)). Functional primitive objects are programs
    that perform the very basic operations, that is, those that provide one simple
    operation. Basic functional operating programs can be pieced together at execution
    time to provide more agile applications. By having these primitive objects coming
    together at execution, it also allows for easier updating of new features and
    functions. These dynamic linkages at execution provides more evolutionary and
    agile systems. The object paradigm is not new; the difference in architectural
    agility is that these objects must be decomposed to its simplest functions. What
    has previously limited the creation of primitives has been execution latency or
    performance issues. The performance limitations related to the ability of networks
    and operating systems to dynamically link primitives to meet performance requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Previous inhibiters to the design of functional primitive objects were incompatibilities
    between hardware and software environments, which are continually evolving to
    address this problem. I think we would agree that disfunction among architectures
    still exist. Just ask people who still experience challenges between Microsoft
    and Apple systems. Certainly, Steve Jobs can be credited with revolutionizing
    the consumer interface when he designed a new Apple architecture based on the
    IPOD and phone designs. This design represents devices that perform less-specific
    applications but serviced a future wireless-based architecture that could perform
    more on-demand operations to meet consumer needs. Ultimately Consumerization of
    Technology treats business applications, personal needs, and everyday life as
    one integrated set of operations. The Apple architecture then has been at the
    forefront of an evolutionary platform that can evolve new hardware and software
    much quicker and efficiently than prior computer systems. In order to keep up
    with an accelerating evolving consumer it is of utmost importance that businesses
    focus on how they will transform their legacy applications into this agile digital
    framework.

    of transforming legacy architecture to meet more of the demands of the consumer.
    As a result, the process of re-engineering, in general, is no longer limited to
    just working with traditional internal users, rather it must integrate both communities
    in any needs assessment. Furthermore, analysis must not only include existing
    consumer needs, but those that might be the trends of the future! For example,

    the Mac would primarily be used as a desktop publishing computer when it was designed
    and first introduced to the consumer market? And did we know that the IPad would
    be so attractive to executives? The answer of course is no, and remember “almost”
    is equivalent to “no” in this example. Ultimately analysis and design will evolve
    to more predictive requirements and will as a result have a failure rate! The
    concept of risk analysis will be discussed further in Chap. [2](480347_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml).
    Ultimately, analysis and design has transitioned to being more about collecting
    data than about self-contained application systems. This transformation is fueling

    is the impetus that fuels the new economy of the future that will be driven by
    sophisticated mobile communications. This inevitably will create a global economy
    driven by wireless mobility. Ultimately, 5G is the enabler—an enabler that will
    allow for specialized networks to participate in what I call “global systems integration”
    of seamless components. It also represents a scalability of networks that can
    be dynamically linked and integrated across consumers, communities, corporations,

    networks. Exactly where these applications are located is part of the challenge
    of analysts. Specifically, IoT devices supported by the increased performance
    provided by 5G, will allow applications to execute on the device itself. This
    is currently known as Edge Computing, where devices will contain more software
    applications and data that can drive performance. Obviously, a program performing
    locally on a device will outperform downloading the program and data from a remote
    server. Resident programs and datasets then can be decomposed down to smaller
    units that can perform the specific functions necessary on an independent and

    to design applications this way emanates from 5G’s ability to transfer local data
    among nodes back and forth more efficiently. It also increases speed to modify
    and update mobile programs on the “Edge.” An example of an IoT decomposed application
    might be a subset or lighter version of Microsoft’s Word product. Consider a subset
    version that might be offered on a device that only allows viewing a Word document
    but without all the functionality. We already such subsets on IPad and IPhone
    products! IoT with the support of 5G will only increase these types of sub-versions
    because of the ability to move data faster among related devices.

    alternatives to where data resides and applications best perform. Obviously, cloud
    provides more operational performance and storage. Cloud has become the economical
    alternative to storing local applications and database storage; more importantly
    it provides access from anywhere. The latter is significant for mobility. There
    are many arguments whether cloud storage should be public or private or both,
    with the issue of cyber security and control at the center of the conversation
    on how organizations utilize this technology. It appears that the public cloud
    supported by third-party hosting companies such as Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure),
    IBM Watson, Google Cloud, Cisco and Oracle to name a few, will be the predominant
    suppliers of the technology. Indeed, the Cloud is quickly becoming known as “Cloud
    Platform-As-A-Service.” 5G only enhances the attractiveness of moving to cloud
    given that the complexity of distributed networks must rely on products and extensive
    data storage to support AI and ML processing.

    autonomous vehicles is the best examples of how 5G, IoT, and cloud must be able

    services. Of course, the use of satellite technology makes most of this possible,

    is really a data structure that builds on the concept of linked list connections.
    Each link or block contains the same transaction history. Thus, blocks can contain
    metadata—such as triggers, conditions, and business logic (rules) as well as stored
    procedures. Blocks can also contain different aspects of data. The design philosophy
    behind blockchain is that all blocks or nodes get updated when new transactions
    are made as data packages that must be accepted by all blocks in the chain. What
    is also significant about blockchain design is that access is based on key cryptography
    and digital signatures that will enhance security. The hope then is that blockchain
    provides the architecture that can maximize cyber security, especially of concern
    with the proliferation of IoT devices and wireless communication. The challenge
    with current blockchain architecture is latency consideration for time sensitive
    updating requirements, especially relevant for financial institutions.

    business need. The Consortium/Community blockchain is a hybrid or “semi-private”
    design. It is similar to a private blockchain but operates across a wider group

    the transactions in a blockchain and should arrive at the same net results or
    disposition of the data and its related activities. Blocks in the chain store
    information such as date, time, and amounts of any transaction—like a purchase
    of goods. Further blockchain stores information of who is participating in any
    transaction, so identity of the individual or entity is recorded and must be known.
    Form a security perspective, blocks in the chain also store unique “hash” codes
    that act as a key to access certain types of information and perform certain types
    of transactions.

- en: Cyber security in analysis and design is perhaps the broadening dimension of
    change in designing hardware and software architectures. Cyber is the only component
    that is integral in every phase of the next generation. It simply is part of every
    analysis and design decision. Another way of articulating this point is to accept
    that cyber security must now be part of the analysis and design process! One must
    design for security to avoid creating Frankenstein 2.0\. The first step to integrate
    cyber analysis and design is to accept its importance or to acknowledge and be
    aware of its importance. Analysts must navigate each component of this new generation
    of architecture and understand where exposures exist in their systems. Determining
    system exposures is now the most important part of analysis given that cyber protection
    is more a business decision than a design determination. Indeed, most cyber security
    professionals would state that almost any system can be designed to maximize security.
    Unfortunately, maximizing security will undoubtably limit performance to satisfy
    many consumer demands. The profession of cyber design then cannot exist without
    the existence of risk. Therefore, most security architectures must be part of
    any risk conversation. This then leads the analysts’ job to interface with the
    necessary business and risk professionals in the organization. Some risk decisions
    are limited because of regulatory restrictions and legal limitations such as Europe’s
    GDPR law. But many decisions must be exposed during the architectural design where
    someone along the way makes a decision on capability versus exposure. Thus, cyber
    security is a new component of the systems development life cycle (SDLC).

    is about the culture of the organization and analysts must gage the level of cyber
    sophistication of a population. Indeed, we know today that many breaches occur
    from careless behaviors of the employees of the organization. As a result, analysis
    must adapt a method of measuring cyber maturity of the organization and then factoring
    in risk as a fundamental part of designing new architectures and applications.

    in nature. The functional component of quantum computers is called a qubit. A
    qubit is a complex and dimensional bit Binary computing, of course, is based solely
    on 0 and 1 sets of bits which perform one calculation at a time. In a qubit there
    are multiple 0’s and 1’s that can be performing simultaneous calculations and
    using multiple available resources to achieve output. Indeed, qubits might utilize
    atoms, ions, photons, or electrons differently even if the same calculation is
    repeated. In effect, qubits are like dynamic processing centers that use multiples
    of available parts to complete a task differently each time. While the resources
    can uniquely be determined upon each execution, there are mathematic probabilities
    that can be predicted under specific situations or states at the time a request
    is made. Obviously then a quantum computer could be a million times more powerful
    than today’s computer.
