- en: The evolution of Distributed Ledger Technologies since the first blockchain
    constitutes an opportunity for digital transformation in many social and economic
    contexts. This transformation will become even more intense in the post–covid-19
    economic scenario. One of the most significant changes in the transformation consumers
    have undergone in their perception of the environment and of the sustainability
    of our societies. The circular economy is an agent of change that helps minimize
    humankind’s impact on the planet. And this change must be aligned with the sustainable
    development goals of the 2030 Agenda. Since its inception, blockchain technology
    has represented an opportunity for transparency, immutability, and persistence
    in the processes in which it intervenes, allowing it to be incorporated into easily
    traceable, disintermediated networks. By implication, this suggests we can move
    towards a verifiable, reliable, circular economy. In this chapter we cover the
    fundamentals of blockchain technology including its history, the elements that
    define distributed ledger technologies, and how they have evolved into their most
    recent forms—e.g., Hashgraph, Direct Acyclic Graphs, Holochain or Neural Distributed
    Ledgers—which represent scalable, efficient, innovative solutions aligned with
    sustainability goals and facilitating the efficient, sustainable management of
    circular economy projects. Finally, drawing on striking use cases in Spain, we
    describe the use of blockchain technology in circular economy projects, and its
    operating status, as examples of ideas for the future development of models that
    may reach the market.

    than financial leanings, although these views are two sides of the same “coin”
    [[12](#CR12)]. More than a decade later, society at large has yet to fully understand
    blockchain technology. Perhaps, its initial adherence to crypto-financial systems

    social institutions are built and, as such, it is the lintel that supports the
    social architecture of our civilizing process. Consequently, the major revolution
    that accompanies blockchain is the way in which it (re)configures trust management
    since it establishes a central criterion: “disintermediation”, that is, the need,

    distributed, disintermediated system without nodes or central entities that decide
    who has access and who does not. Another is the development of a cryptographic
    system that supports this. Cryptography has been with us from Antiquity right
    up to the more recent work of Alan Turing during World War II, and with the appearance
    of blockchain, it has now acquired special relevance in cybersecurity systems.
    On this, the creation of bitcoin was based.

    systems functioning in an environment with no central operator or authority, even
    though the parties involved may be unreliable or malicious, and may exist in harsh
    environments. Blockchain technology is considered a specific subset of the broader
    DLT ecosystem, and it uses a specific data structure consisting of a chain of
    data blocks linked with cryptographic hashing functions. The concept of DLTs was
    first described in 1982, and that of blockchain first appeared in 1991\. However,
    they were actually deployed prior to their massive incorporation into society.

    is characterized by the presence of malicious actors in the system or network,
    who undermine it by subverting its intended use. The prototypical adversary in
    a DLT system is an entity that attempts to exploit consensus rules to transfer
    assets without authorization, censor the transactions of others, or disrupt or
    destroy the network. Opponents can operate both inside (on-chain) and outside
    (off-chain) the system. Hence, governance schemes to establish the management
    framework are crucial to the management of any type of platform [[8](#CR8)].

    network. It consists of a linked sequence of blocks, containing a timestamp (for
    each block) and transactions secured by a public cryptographic key and verified
    by the entire network community. Once an item is added to the blockchain, it cannot
    be altered and becomes an immutable record of past activity.

    of a distributed registry ecosystem have meant that they can be classified in
    many different ways. From an academic point of view, researchers have proposed
    several classifications of blockchain technology. For instance [[23](#CR23)],
    put forward a two-dimensional approach: by typology of the existence of the authority
    that predefines it, and in terms of how the nodes that cooperate in it are encouraged
    to participate. Platt [[24](#CR24)] shared this binary approach since it focuses
    on the blockchain data dissemination model and the functionality of its on-chain
    system (“stateful” versus “stateless”). Lemieux [[17](#CR17)] analyzed blockchain
    from an archival point of view and proposed the following types of record keeping
    system: the “mirror type”, the “digital record” and the “tokenized model”. Lemieux
    also examined each type in relation to a formal framework of theoretical evaluation
    of defined file types. Xu et al. [[30](#CR30)] based their classification on a
    study of the approximation of the layers available to each type of blockchain.
    Their aim was to evaluate the impact of design decisions in each blockchain on
    the architecture of the software that defines them. Their proposed taxonomy examined
    aspects of software architecture relating to the performance and quality of the
    systems studied. Finally, we would like to point out two studies published in
    2018, which place the accent on the concepts studied earlier, and conduct a structured
    review of these. Tasca and Tessone [[27](#CR27)] attempted to determine a comprehensive,
    detailed ontology of previous research. Ballandies et al. [[5](#CR5)] conducted
    a technological review and constructed a taxonomy of 29 systems chosen from the
    more than 1000 existing at the time. To date, their work constitutes one of the
    best summaries of DLT typologies and their characterization with a view to future
    attempts at standardization.'

- en: The concept of “ledger” is central to the technology and implies an understanding
    of the transformative capacity that blockchains entail [[31](#CR31)]. However,
    it should be noted that in the academic field two different ideas tend to overlap.
    On the one hand, “ledger” is defined as the set of data that most nodes have in
    common; on the other, it is the set of data held by a node in an individual network.
    We believe that this dual vision actually operates as one which, in our judgment,
    would be the authorized set of collective records of a significant proportion
    of network participants at any one time so that the records are unlikely to be
    deleted or modified (i.e., “definitive”). And one very important factor that must
    be taken into account is the fact that it is an abstract construct that enables
    us to understand the collective power of the distributed network that fosters
    and maintains a DLT. It is not an object that exists independently, nor is it
    unique or stored independently. This level of abstraction is what determines the
    format of this technology.

    that takes advantage of the computer’s disk storage instead of incurring high
    energy costs due to the use of computer graphic resources to mine the tokens.
    This makes PoW unnecessary. Instead, it uses a consensus mechanism called Proof
    of Space and Time (PoST) [[1](#CR1)] to take advantage of the data management
    capabilities of hard drives. This is where the blockchain’s native token—the “Chia”—is
    mined. It develops an intelligent transaction platform based on the UTXO model.
    The UTXO approach is much simpler, easier to implement, has lower overhead on
    full nodes, and results in much more reliable, secure, and succinct smart transactions.
    The Solidity model (bitcoin) is much more dangerous, expensive, and unreliable,
    but it does have greater expressive power. Chia’s developer is Bram Cohen, the
    inventor of BitTorrent, the most widespread P2P system on the Internet and the

    Voting power and rewards derive from key attributes, including the total number

    the network, while a cohort of “standby” producers is paid and regularly tested
    to act as backup.

    time via elections that are held continuously, approximately every 2.5 min. Equally,
    producers can be voted out of the top 21 at any time too. The network also has
    standby validators that are automatically rotated into the top 21 at intervals
    to give their operations a chance to produce blocks and prove their readiness.

    (Indra Group) and constitutes the main CE blockchain platform in Spain. This CE
    platform’s network of distributed registers will help public administrations,
    local entities, operators, recyclers, and other organizations to safely share
    and control all system data and accelerate all transactions relating to the waste
    selection process while promoting process transparency, awareness, and cost reduction.

    record, making all operations and transactions conducted by participants in the
    ecosystem more transparent and more easily auditable. Furthermore, as there is
    no central system, the platform has no global infrastructure development or maintenance
    costs; these are shared among the participants.

    (withdrawal identifier, plant, material type, or possible non-conformity, among
    others) and documentary evidence that guarantees the existence of a document at
    a given time and facilitates its inspection for later modifications. In addition,
    it enables the establishment of intelligent agreements, for example, on the delivery
    of materials or packaging, which facilitate the automation of payments or penalties
    for non-compliance.

- en: In this chapter, we have outlined the main characteristics of a distributed
    ledger technology. However, there remains a lack of understanding as to what does
    or does not constitute a DLT. Moreover, an academic and economic debate also exists
    about what comprises a blockchain or a DLT. Interestingly though this is, in the
    present chapter we have avoided analyzing this topic, instead of arguing that
    blockchain represents both the first and second generations of DLTs. A blockchain
    is just one type of DLT. In Sect. 7, we defined the most compelling proposal for
    new, 4th generation DLTs, which entails a change of mindset if they are to be
    adopted in CE projects.

    deployed in Spain—many of which use Ethereum. Clearly, we would encourage the
    use of current, widely used blockchain platforms to develop dApps and dApp-based
    solutions. However, if we want Agenda 2030 to make headway, we need to design
    and use new tools and frameworks that could fully match CE projects.
