    similar capabilities and methods of deployment. And not one of them has differentiated
    itself enough at this point to be a clear leader in an emerging market. Gartner’s
    June 2019 Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms, for example, has no leaders

    extract value from data, reduce costs, improve operations, and present new business
    models, analysts recommend that businesses looking for a platform devote time

    In oil and gas, the use cases are supply chain optimization and worker safety.

    management team, your IT maintenance engineers, your suppliers/vendors, and, in

    project. Ensure that the IoT platform has sufficient community of customers and
    developers. You should request for customer references and check how they are
    benefited with the platform in use. A good partner and developer ecosystem is
    a sign of good global support. Both partners and developer ecosystem can help
    deploy and configure faster and achieve time to market. Certificates of third-party
    validations such as security or platform stability or customer testimonials may
    be a good filtration criterion to choose a platform.'

    the use of advanced protection mechanisms is more than a good idea. It’s no news
    that IoT ecosystems usually integrate with various devices. Since not all of them
    have security features already built in, it is essential to use centralized protection
    tools. Oracle takes advantage of high-quality security mechanisms. Reliable protection
    of IoT systems from any external threats is what makes Oracle exclusive.
