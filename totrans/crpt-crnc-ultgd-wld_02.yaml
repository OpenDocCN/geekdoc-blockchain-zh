    10.1 million American households—that’s 8.3 percent of the total population—with
    a net worth of at least $1 million, compared to just 5.9 percent in the heart
    of the Great Recession.

    and started talking about how I thought the world would switch to Bitcoin like any
    second now. In 2009, I thought the USD was ready to collapse (and put my money
    in gold). I was recently out of the military and spent time into self-reliance
    stuff with my brother; we had a multi-acre "compound/mini-farm" with as many as
    10 people living there.

    years. But this may be a few years away. Despite dips over the years, the Bitcoin

    currencies will take the lead over time. The longer Bitcoin scaling remains unresolved,
    the more other currencies will grow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2.  The best choice to me appeared to be Ethereum, based on its development
    roadmap. I have learned (mostly from reading articles) to invest in something
    with utility and value. To me, Ethereum is such a coin. Bitcoin only has first-mover
    advantage left, and Core devs are presently destroying that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Also, it's worth noting that even if Bitcoin Scaling does get resolved, the resolution
    process itself (forking) will likely be a messy bloodbath. I consider this another
    invaluable piece of investing knowledge. I invite you to use it.
