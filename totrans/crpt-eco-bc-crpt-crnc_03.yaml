- en: Even though the financial reward for creating new blocks is going away, the
    transaction fee remains an incentive to attract miners. In blockchain, users will
    be charged a certain fee in order to broadcast and document each transaction.
    The fee then goes to the miners who will put the information into the blocks.
    This generates a “bidding system.” Bidding happens when there are many transactions
    waiting to be put into blocks. The higher a transaction fee you are willing to
    pay, the better chance you have of jumping ahead in the waiting line. As the fee
    for completing transactions keeps going up, miners will keep becoming more important
    in the world blockchain and cryptocurrency. (Miners are similar to the programmers
    working at Internet companies who maintain functions.)

  zh: 或许对ICO的关注是因为市场上的投机者，他们寻求快速获利，在ICO最初无监管的时期利用了这一体系。然而随着ICO世界越来越多的 pump-and-dump
    计划出现，一个自我净化的机制被触发。投资银行、金融服务提供商以及硅谷的科技公司加入进来，对寻求ICO的项目的进行筛选和审核。所有这些力量的结合提高了入门门槛，过滤掉了不合格或可疑的交易。
- en: Any project going for an ICO is now being examined closely by multiple entities.
    Endorsements from qualified individuals or institutions are not given lightly.
    Further, the time frame of an ICO has been extended, allowing investors more time
    to conduct their due diligence. And overall, the procedure for launching an ICO
    has become more standardized.

- en: Perhaps some resistance should not be surprising. After all, the ICO is challenging
    the existing capital-raising format. Because it is more barrier-free than typical
    VC raises, people are jumping in. While not all ICOs have been successful—and,
    yes, some have been scams—there are many blockchain startups that have been wildly
    successful under the ICO model. The vast majority of these businesses are trying
    their best to bring genuine value to people’s daily lives through the world of
    blockchain.

- en: Martin Chen, founder of GDP Capital, a New York-based consulting firm, believes
    that most Internet-based services are suitable for an ICO. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
    are born on the Internet, and they share the same “genes”—you might say—in that
    they both connect one person to another in a truly open world. In a token-centered
    community, information regarding the total number of tokens to be issued is always
    transparent and certain. Everyone in the community has access to this information,
    and the value of the token will go up as more and more people join that community.
    Obviously, there are tremendous benefits to this model. For the foreseeable future,
    I think it’s reasonable to believe that token-centered communities will prove
    themselves superior to a traditional stock-based model.

- en: Regionally imposed restrictions now have less of an influence on ICOs. Because
    of this, more and more Chinese companies seeking to go public are considering
    an ICO instead of an IPO. ICOs, through token sales, introduce firm advantages
    of liquidity to the stock. For many companies, an ICO is also appealing because
    it undercuts (or eliminates entirely) the costs and complicated paperwork usually
    involved in an IPO. Further, an ICO does not require companies to “open their
    books” to reveal their existing business performance. Many owners find this makes
    them more comfortable with the ICO model.

  zh: 地区性强制限制现在对ICO的影响越来越小。因此，越来越多的中国公司寻求上市时考虑ICO而不是IPO。通过代币销售，ICO为股票带来了流动性的固有优势。对许多公司来说，ICO之所以有吸引力，是因为它降低了（或完全消除了）IPO通常涉及的成本和复杂文件。此外，ICO不需要公司“打开他们的账本”来揭示他们现有的业务表现。许多所有者认为这使他们更愿意接受ICO模式。
- en: Have no doubt about it, the ICO is designed to challenge the traditional VC
    model. Yet whenever a company is in the process of launching an ICO, nothing prevents
    a venture capitalist from buying tokens and becoming a part of that community.
    In a way, this can open up new possibilities for traditional VC investors. For
    example, the valuation of a company is not restricted to the decrees or findings
    of a few specialized institutions but is based on the consensus of the whole community.
    The ICO model also offers solutions and opportunities for companies in industries
    that are usually ignored by VC.

    ICO model, we can see the promulgation of this model as another blow for decentralization
    (and against a small cluster of powerful regulating bodies). However, it will
    always be pointed out that subverting the power of traditional regulating institutions
    has been a double-edged sword—or at least it was in the early days of ICOs. Eight
    or nine years ago, there were definitely speculators who got in the game solely
    to rook people. Projects and companies turned out to be scams and schemes. This
    forced ICO investors to collectively become more savvy, and the learning curve
    was quick. But these early leaks did not sink the ship.

- en: ICOs are also popular because they hold the potential for remarkably superior
    ROI (Return On Investment) when compared to other offerings. With traditional
    VC investments, it usually takes ten years to get one’s initial investment back
    and then realize a profit. The rapid growth in blockchain and cryptocurrency has
    made this time horizon a relic of the past. In the world of blockchain, things
    move quickly. Things happen, and they don’t stop to take a break. The energy is
    young and wild. Opportunities are everywhere. Investors now understand that people
    need to move fast in this world if they want to catch the early train before it
    leaves the platform—and cash in on the benefits of being an early investor. In
    today’s climate, it usually takes fewer than twenty-four hours for a major American

- en: Back in the US, after rejecting the Winklevoss brothers’ initial application
    for a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), the SEC has made statements recently
    that hint it may be changing its tune on the idea. If one thing is sure, it’s
    that we’re at a juncture in which governments’ attitudes toward Bitcoin and crypto
    are largely unknowable—and if they are known, they’re revealed to vary widely
    from country to country. Some countries are very friendly when it comes to crypto,
    and some are the opposite. In Germany, for example, Bitcoin is now technically
    a “legal tender,” meaning that Bitcoin is allowed to be used for tax purposes
    and for commercial trading. In the United States, Bitcoin can be used like regular
    money in many situations—and many businesses accept it—but it is not considered
    to be legal tender by the IRS. However, as we all know, this doesn’t mean the
    IRS isn’t “interested” in your Bitcoins. They are very interested. Bitcoins are
    considered to be your personal property, just like gold or a house, which means
    they have to comply with tax codes. According to the IRS, the value of a Bitcoin
    for US tax purposes is its fair market value in US dollars on the date it is received,
    and any transaction fees are added to that. If a person is trading Bitcoins as
    capital assest, then the gain is supposed to be taxed at capital gains rate.

  zh: 在美国，SEC 在拒绝 Winklevoss 兄弟关于比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）的初步申请后，最近发表声明，暗示它可能会改变对这一想法的态度。有一点是确定的，那就是我们正处在一个政府对比特币和加密货币的态度几乎无法得知的阶段——即使这些态度为人所知，也表现出国家之间的广泛差异。一些国家在加密货币方面非常友好，而一些国家则相反。例如，在德国，比特币现在技术上是一种“法定货币”，这意味着比特币被允许用于税务目的和商业交易。在美国，比特币在许多情况下可以像普通货币一样使用——许多企业接受它——但它不被
    IRS 视为法定货币。然而，正如我们所知，这并不意味着 IRS 对你的比特币不“感兴趣”。他们非常感兴趣。比特币被视为你的个人财产，就像黄金或房子一样，这意味着它们必须遵守税法。根据
    IRS 的规定，比特币在美国税务目的的价值是其收到当天的公平市场价值，任何交易费用都要加到这个价值上。如果一个人正在以资本资产的形式交易比特币，那么收益应按资本收益税率征税。
- en: As the appeal of crypto pushes the door wider and wider, traditional investment
    banks are catching on to the game. According to the New York Times, Goldman Sachs
    is about to open a Bitcoin trading operation on Wall Street. The operation will
    not buy or sell Bitcoins directly but is rather designed to meet the needs of
    their clients who may be exploring investments in cryptocurrency. Wall Street
    has generally shied away from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but Goldman’s decision
    to dip its toe in the water may be a bellwether. In a recent interview, Rana Yared,
    an executive involved in creating these offerings, said that Goldman Sachs “had
    concluded Bitcoin is not a fraud.” Many clients of Goldman Sachs consider Bitcoin
    a commodity of value, and Goldman knows this. Because the amount of Bitcoins is
    forever set, a comparison to a commodity like gold makes sense for Goldman’s clients.
    There is a finite amount of gold in the world. Barring an innovation by alchemists,
    there will never be more than there is right now. This connection to something
    real and finite is probably the quality that most makes Goldman comfortable moving

    Rana Yared 表示，高盛“已经得出比特币不是欺诈的结论。”高盛的许多客户认为比特币是一种有价值的商品，高盛知道这一点。由于比特币的数量是固定的，对于高盛的客户来说，将其与黄金等商品进行比较是有意义的。世界上黄金的总量是有限的。除非炼金术士有创新，否则现在拥有的黄金数量永远不会更多。这种与真实且有限的事物之间的联系，可能是让高盛最舒适前进的品质。
