    new Bitcoins are released into the system. As the most valuable cryptocurrency,
    many people can’t wait to get into Bitcoin mining. But how precisely does it work?

    In order to avoid the double spending issue, Satoshi introduced blockchain, which
    will document every single transaction that happens, has ever happened, or is
    ever going to happen. But blockchain does not create itself. It depends on computer
    processing power to generate new blocks into the chain and maintain the system
    function. This is the true purpose of mining. Bitcoins are the reward for miners
    who either create new blocks or input transaction information into blockchain.

    into the network). This is the most critical work when it comes to maintaining
    the circulation of Bitcoin. But they also have to create new blocks, an activity
    that can be strikingly competitive. Miners compete with one another for new blocks.

    as the incentive to encourage miners to fulfill the validation part of a job.

    encourage miners to maintain the function of blockchain. But since the total number
    of Bitcoins is 21 million and only 210,000 Bitcoins are released every four years,
    the reward halves accordingly. Thus, in 2009, the reward was 50 Bitcoins in a
    block. But by 2016, it was down to 12.5 Bitcoins for each new block. When all
    Bitcoins are released into the system, the reward will drop to zero.

    transaction fee remains an incentive to attract miners. In blockchain, users will
    be charged a certain fee in order to broadcast and document each transaction.
    The fee then goes to the miners who will put the information into the blocks.
    This generates a “bidding system.” Bidding happens when there are many transactions
    waiting to be put into blocks. The higher a transaction fee you are willing to
    pay, the better chance you have of jumping ahead in the waiting line. As the fee
    for completing transactions keeps going up, miners will keep becoming more important
    in the world blockchain and cryptocurrency. (Miners are similar to the programmers
    working at Internet companies who maintain functions.)

    turns the cryptotrading itself into mining. For each transaction fee that users
    pay FCoin on its platform (in Bitcoin or Ethereum), users will be compensated
    100 percent in FTs (a token issued by FCoin). Meanwhile, the platform will also
    allocate 80 percent of the transaction fee to FTs holders.

    Since trading and mining are the same thing on FCoin, if you trade on FCoin, the

    percent of transaction fees generated from the platform proportional to the amount
    of FTs you hold. (This model has been defined by some as a “Token Economy.”)

    of risk. Satoshi created the first block. (People call it “the genius block.”)
    And every single block generated afterward is linked back to it. Blockchain is
    continuously growing as new transactions take place. But as I mentioned earlier,
    the fundamental architecture of blockchain requires a great amount of computing
    power. Computing power determines the speed of the mining, and the speed of the

    in the kitchen was enough for forty-niners to retrieve those loose gold flakes
    and nuggets. But as more and more people joined in the search for their own California
    Dream, the tools had to become more advanced. In the first five years of Gold
    Rush, about 370 tons of gold were recovered—mostly by people digging with their

    interviewed by CNBC. In this interview, he stated that tokens and ICOs were securities.
