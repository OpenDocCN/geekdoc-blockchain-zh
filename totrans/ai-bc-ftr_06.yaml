    securities market transactions. We argue that the ability to lower transaction
    costs combined with the reduction of intermediaries and improvements in transaction
    efficiency will promote the implementation of blockchain technology in these markets.
    We use platform economics to illustrate how blockchain-based securities exchanges
    can reduce unfair rents that platform operators extract from the investing public
    under the current regulatory regime, and indicate how the economics of platforms
    might be used to implement a blockchain solution to enhance the exchange process.
    We argue that in order to reduce transaction costs and increase the potential
    for innovation, blockchain platforms should be moved from the supply-side to an
    intermediary position and operate as a neutral party that straddles both sides
    of the market. Finally, we find that open routing procedures are likely to positively
    impact the market and enhance the efficiency of securities market transactions.

    to the currently organized securities markets. In the recent years, blockchain
    technology garnered a lot of attention after it was successfully implemented in
    cryptocurrency markets, most notably with Bitcoin. Only recently, Bitcoin and
    the idea that a cryptocurrency, built on a distributed ledger network, could offer
    the world an alternative to traditional forms of currencies that are controlled
    by central banks was once reserved for “nerds, libertarians and drug dealers”
    [[31](#CR31)]. However, more and more financial markets are adopting the blockchain
    technology and it is only a matter of time when securities exchanges will follow
    the suit. For example, in September 2016, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)
    released a request for consultation paper that communicated their desire to receive
    assistance in analyzing and evaluating their current business requirements and
    potentially transition from their current order processing, clearing, and settlement
    system to a new system that is built on the blockchain technology [[3](#CR3)].
    ASX had begun discussing the implementation of an alternative to the CHESS system,
    which they currently use to process, clear, and settle trades on their exchange,
    at the end of 2017\. ASX plans to have the blockchain system operational by 2023.

- en: To illustrate how blockchain technology can help to facilitate securities transactions,
    one can think about what happens when a transaction is made over a traditional
    securities market. Over traditional financial exchanges, the investor calls a
    broker or inputs an order, the broker routes that order to a specialist or a market
    maker, and the market maker matches a buy and a sell order to complete the transaction.
    After this occurs, the shares and the purchase price associated with those shares
    are exchanged through an intermediary. This process may require the presence of
    multiple intermediaries and may, potentially, suffer from cost and time inefficiencies.
    Fortunately, Bitcoin highlighted how a distributed network ledger system, commonly
    referred to as blockchain technology, could be used to help facilitate market
    transactions without the presence of an intermediary and execute these transactions
    in a more efficient manner (i.e., direct transactions, which are unencumbered
    by an intermediary).

    terms of adoption and we would be remiss if we did not shed light on some of these
    potential issues before highlighting how advances in blockchain-based technologies
    could revolutionize trading in securities markets. According to Chang et al. [[10](#CR10)],
    the primary issues that delay the implementation of a blockchain solution across
    securities markets on a broader scale are the following: (a) Scalability, (b)
    Security, (c) Privacy, and (d) Energy Consumption. Further, Guo and Liang [[22](#CR22)]
    question whether disintermediation is even possible. They contend that some level
    of centralization is likely required to ensure that certain information is safeguarded.
    However, a multi-centered weakly intermediated solution is most likely to prevail.
    So, there are real questions regarding the scalability, security, privacy, and
    the energy consumption associated with the implementation of a blockchain solution,
    but we believe that in time markets will provide novel solutions to these problems
    and it is unlikely that an entirely disintermediated trading solution will arise,
    but movement towards this disintermediated solution will likely reduce costs and
    make markets more efficient.'

    to undergo the most significant transformation due to the introduction of blockchain
    technology that “will allow for a true redesign of current procedures for clearing,
    settlement, and custody, no more anchored to the presence of a central counterparty.”
    The author contends that the secondary market transactions benefit from “a sort
    of natural monopoly granted by available technology and regulation. Blockchain
    could disrupt such monopoly, promoting higher efficiency, shorter duration and
    cost reduction in post-trading processes.” The study claims that the adoption
    of the blockchain technology to process and settle transactions in the secondary
    market could reduce the cost associated with equity analysts by 25%, which is
    estimated to be a 7% decrease in the aggregate transaction costs on the European
    exchanges and bring a 15% reduction of the exchange-related costs in Australia.
    We believe that this significant cost reduction potential of blockchain-based
    exchanges will speed the transition from the traditionally organized exchanges
    to blockchain-based exchanges.

    massive changes that we have seen in the U.S. Postal Service as a result of the
    introduction of email as the preferred medium of communication. The most appropriate
    and likely route to adoption of blockchain technologies is a slower, more thoughtful
    and patient adoption of a blockchain solution. According to the author, a complete
    replacement of the institutions and systems that are currently available to broker
    exchange related transactions in the securities markets would engender significant
    institutional inertia. First, many jobs are dependent on the current structure
    and an ouright replacement would cause massive job market dislocations in these
    industries. Second, laws that regulate the securities markets would have to receive
    a massive overhaul, which provides a framework to transact over these new exchanges.

    network. The author also looks at whether the blockchain or distributed ledger
    system is worth it and if the traditional trust-based methods of transacting are
    superior to these more consensus-driven solutions. Berentsen and Schar [[4](#CR4)]
    illustrate that through a consensus-based framework where the miners in a system
    (i.e., auditors) are incentivized to reach agreements about additions to the blockchain
    because that is how they generate compensation and that this leads to efficiency.
    However, according to the authors “mining is expensive, as the computations use
    large amounts of electricity and are increasingly dependent on highly specialized
    hardware.” Andolfatto [[2](#CR2)] and Berentsen and Schar [[4](#CR4)] also look
    at the potential benefits associated with a blockchain solution to securities
    market transactions, and question whether the benefits that society potentially
    may receive from a system built on the blockchain network would outweigh the costs
    from an economic and social perspective. Further, Cai [[8](#CR8)] suggests that
    advances in blockchain technologies will likely be applied by financial intermedaries
    to obtain further cost advantages, which they may share with their clients, but
    their applications of these advances in technology will likely help them to retain
    their monopolistic position.

- en: Before we start to imagine the future of blockchain-based securities exchanges,
    we should focus briefly on the underlying structure. Three major features of a
    blockchain ledger are openness, decentralization, and continuous competitive record
    validation. In an open public blockchain ledger, past transactions are saved on
    multiple computers in a peer network. To prevent tampering with records, transactions
    are periodically bundled into blocks. A cryptographic hash is calculated from
    the contents of each block and a unique hash identifier is assigned to that block.
    Each block contains the most recent transactions as well as a link, in terms of
    the previous block’s hash, to information from all past blocks. Bundling of the
    blocks creates a chain of blocks, or blockchain. Modifying any part of the past
    transaction record changes the hash related to the block where the transaction
    was originally recorded as well as hashes related to all subsequent blocks. Therefore,
    each node verifies hashes locally, but the validation of transactions is performed
    by comparing hash identifiers stored on multiple computers in the peer network
    (i.e., based on consensus throughout the network). If anyone alters any block
    in the chain, the hashes associated with the altered blockchain will not match
    the peers’ records of the blockchain and, therefore, the altered record will be
    discovered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain network, the hash identifiers must start
    with a certain number of zeros. To create such a hash identifier for each respective
    block of data, a certain number, called “nonce”, is added to the block of data.
    Peers on the blockchain network (called miners) try to compute (or mine) the “nonce”
    as quickly as possible. The peer that computes the “nonce” first closes the block
    of data and receives some compensation in form of Bitcoins. The closed block is
    then added to the blockchain and distributed to network peers. If anyone wanted
    to alter any existing block of data, they would have to re-compute “nonces” for
    the respective and all subsequent blocks more efficiently than other peers which
    is very costly (or almost impossible) by design. The miners are, therefore, not
    really mining anything—they exist to validate that the blocks are accurate and
    that they have not been tampered with.

    security ownership, the supply-side and the demand-side. The supply of a security
    on the supply-side is verified by a distributed group of auditors or miners just
    as the amount of capital available to purchase the security from the demand side
    is verified based on previous records contained within the existing blockchain.
    Once agents *D* and *S* agree to transact, a record of their transaction is amended
    to the previous block and becomes a portion of the blockchain. From a recordkeeping
    and auditing perspective, the utilization of the blockchain solution seems to
    be a more efficient way to execute securities market transactions and a natural
    evolution of the centralized system would be to move to a decentralized network,
    which eliminates the participation of an unnecessary intermediary to complete
    a transaction.

    information in recent applications of the blockchain technology to cryptocurrency
    markets. Nakamoto [[38](#CR38)] highlighted how the transactions on the Bitcoin
    cryptocurrency network would be secure and private by indicating that even though
    all transactions are part of the public record, like trades that are currently
    displayed in order books, “privacy can be maintained by breaking the flow of information
    in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.” According to Nakamoto [[38](#CR38)],
    by creating and retaining a new cryptographic key pair for each transaction, an
    additional firewall could be added so that “the public can see that someone is
    sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction
    to anyone”.'

    prevents large financial firms from using the current blockchain infrastructure.
    However, digital security firms are working to integrate highly secure processors
    that are designed to secure passwords and digital keys so that larger firms are
    more comfortable participating in a more distributed networked environment [[26](#CR26)].

    a significant motivator for the traditional exchanges to move to the blockchain-based
    systems. We can illustrate how this may happen by looking at the evolution of
    portfolio management that moved from active management to passive strategies.
    The value provided by active portfolio management was early questioned by Cowles
    [[13](#CR13)] who cast doubt on the assumption that beating the market was probable
    for people that were hard working and well-informed and found that the ‘experts,’
    on average, could not beat a randomly drawn sample of security selections. Ellis
    [[16](#CR16)] outlines the history of ever-increasing fees that advisors have
    historically charged to manage assets and adds that while the decreased value
    added combined with increased costs should move markets towards structures with
    lower costs, such as passive portfolio management, nevertheless, the acceptance
    of social innovation, in general, can be problematic since leading members of
    the establishment are often dismissive of *all* new ideas as they have much to

    markets are different from search markets as in search markets the buyer and the
    seller search to transact and in intermediary markets products are bought and
    sold by an intermediary. Intermediaries charge a spread and are costly to use,
    which leads us to question whether they are needed. Gerhig [[20](#CR20)] argues
    that the intermediaries offer immediacy and they can often obtain access to goods
    (in our case, shares) at the bid price, if purchasing, or the ask price, if selling,
    and generate a profit from the spread. If the spread is too high, a prospective
    purchaser is likely to seek an alternative to going through the intermediary and
    attempt to go directly to the seller and trade in the frictional market.

- en: As the frictions inherent in the marketplace vanish so does the need for an
    intermediary and their market power. The central discussion in Gerhig [[20](#CR20)]
    hinges on the contention of how much and to what extent organized markets reduce
    trading costs. On the one hand, the author finds that competition amongst intermediaries
    and the frictional market leads to a Walrasian outcome and pushes transaction
    costs to zero. On the other hand, if the intermediation business has fixed entry
    cost that provides a prohibitive barrier to entry, then the industrial structure
    is more properly defined as a natural monopoly. The intermediary acts akin to
    a monopolist to maximize profits but is constrained to some extent by the competition
    from the frictional market. Intermediation in the equity markets, in which market
    makers and specialists trade their own inventories to assist in price discovery,
    adds value. However, if intermediaries extract unfair ‘profits’ from engaging
    in this activity, it would be beneficial if the costs associated with accessing
    this platform, were reduced.

    exchange market is structured (and older markets were set up) is that there are
    significant barriers to entry created by regulatory bodies that purport to protect
    consumers. These barriers were important as markets needed an intermediary to
    retain a record of their transactions, to hold the security certificates that
    they had in ‘street form’ so that they could make transactions instantaneously,
    to provide them with quotes on the securities that they were interested in purchasing
    or liquidating, and to guarantee that the security that they were purchasing was
    what they believed it was. Under the current regime, these services would not
    be needed in most markets because all of the above can be incorporated into a

    of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through an

    of pricing and how that choice affects the agent’s decision of whether to transact

    in their comparison of QWERTY and VHS, and the network effects generated on the
    demand-side, indicated that the incumbent supplier of a particular good, be it
    the QWERTY or the VHS, does not welcome competition because there would be no
    way to benefit initially from that additional supplier entering the market. Nevertheless,
    consumers prefer competition because it gives them more choices about who they
    purchase their goods from. It also puts downward price pressure on the goods and
    offers an alternative if the incumbent firm goes out of business. In this case,
    the externality runs from producers to consumers. According to Parker et al. [[40](#CR40)],
    initially the consumer is not really concerned about how many other consumers
    adopt a particular platform because additional consumers might price them out
    of the market. However, producers are really concerned about how many consumers
    use their platform because the number of consumers that adopt their chosen platform
    affects their production opportunities. In this case, the externality runs from
    consumers to producers. Similarly, the network externalities, according to Parker
    et al. [[40](#CR40)] can run either way and both producers and consumers prefer
    growth in their respective markets; however, “this may be mediated by the indirect
    effect of the internetwork externality. At issue is whether own-market entry expands
    participation on the other side of each transaction.” When thinking about platforms
    and platform economics, Parker et al. [[40](#CR40)] introduce the ‘platform’ as
    a third participant in this marketplace that straddles “both markets, can set
    prices more efficiently by internalizing these two-sided externalities. Independent
    firms serving either market separately lose this advantage.”

    and receives much corporate attention.” The study also explores the idea of platform
    competition and how ‘multihoming,’ which occurs when consumers and producers use
    multiple platforms, “intensifies price competition on the other side as platforms
    use low prices in an attempt to ‘steer’ end users on the latter side toward an

    exchange run on the blockchain technology? The introduction of a blockchain-based
    securities exchange could supplement the use of the traditional brokered exchange
    markets and offer capabilities to bring additional sources of supply and demand
    into the marketplace by lowering transaction costs and increasing efficiency through
    competition. Also, if the platform was built so that it encourages the development
    of functional applications in a decentralized manner, developers could be allowed
    to experiment with adding additional functionality to this blockchain exchange.
    Presumably, by allowing experimentation, breakthroughs in the application and
    the capabilities of the blockchain exchange will likely spur competition in terms
    of exploration of how to create more effective and efficient mechanism to transact
    across the traditional networks.

    network externalities that could arise because of the implementation of such a
    solution. In this section, we will consider how positive or negative externalities
    may affect a platform operator’s profit opportunities. Consider the model of externalities
    developed in Katz and Shapiro [[29](#CR29)]. The authors develop a general model
    of network competition and devise a partial equilibrium oligopoly model in which
    there are no income effects and the consumers’ objective is to maximize their
    individual surplus. However, the consumers’ ability to maximize their surplus
    is dependent on their understanding and proper forecasting of the future size
    of the network associated with whatever brand (or in our case, platform) they

    (iii) consumers choose a platform by comparing their reservation prices and the

    that there are three consumption externalities that one should consider when analyzing
    the network effects associated with the choice of a platform or exchange: (i)
    a direct network effect that is associated with an investor’s willingness (reluctance)
    to trade on a particular platform because a friend or someone that she knows had
    a positive (negative) experience trading on that platform, (ii) an indirect externality
    resulting from the demand and supply-side belief that the exchange will be adopted
    by other agents, and (iii) an externality resulting from the bolt-on or add-on
    services associated with the marketplace. The first two network effects are critical
    to establishing the blockchain based solution in any specific geographic location.
    The third effect seems to be the most critical when contemplating broader scale
    adoption and integration on a global scale. Katz et al. [[29](#CR29)] argue that
    the output of an industry, or a number of transactions in our case, increases

    mechanisms that aid in the transfer of shares across nations, simultaneously converting
    the ask prices for securities traded in foreign markets into the domestic currency,
    and allowing access to securities that were more costly to purchase under the

- en: Hermalin and Katz [[23](#CR23)] took a somewhat different approach in their
    analysis of two-sided markets. Instead of analyzing intermediaries, they focused
    their attention on the routing implications associated with platform choice. The
    main conclusions reached by the authors is that “membership decisions can override
    formal rules and lead to counterintuitive equilibrium outcomes.” They continue
    by explaining that, in equilibrium, if party *A* is considering a transaction
    with party *B* and there are multiple networks to transact over, and party *A*
    is also given formal authority to route the order, the transaction tends to be
    routed through party *B*’s preferred network. In addition, all else equal, if
    one network imposes routing restrictions on its participants, that network receives
    a lower share of transactions than its competitors. Thus, allowing prospective
    parties to choose the platform on which they will transact will increase transaction
    volume throughout the system and minimize the potential problem of trade inefficiency
    [[23](#CR23)]. To relate this to our primary consideration, which is whether a
    blockchain alternative to the current securities transaction markets should exist,
    we need to look at whether it will positively impact the current securities market
    and whether such a market is likely to increase efficiency. Based on the above,
    we argue that routing by choice is preferred to mandated routing procedures both
    in terms of welfare maximization and in terms of the total volume of trade that
    would occur over both networks.

    virtual monopoly over the provision of securities laws” ever since they passed
    the Securities Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934\. Further, the author explains that
    because U.S. securities exchanges were the most liquid in the world, there was
    little danger of multinational corporations going elsewhere to raise capital and,
    therefore, they needed to follow the rules associated with raising debt and equity
    in U.S. capital markets. However, over time the public market for the provisioning
    of securities laws is evolving because the services offered by exchanges are becoming
    commoditized as floor-based exchanges are being replaced by electronic trading
    systems. To compete globally, national regulators (and legislatures) are motivated
    to provide attractive, cost-effective rules for foreign and domestic companies
    in order to protect or grow their domestic exchanges and financial centers. The

- en: Using the four quadrants associated with the adoption of foundational technologies,
    as illustrated in Iansiti et al. [[25](#CR25)], we think that the most direct
    path towards the adoption of blockchain technology to help facilitate securities
    transactions will likely start through single use and localization applications,
    which are not complex, but move from a low to high degree of novelty. According
    to Iansiti et al. [[25](#CR25)], the single use applications create better, cheaper,
    and highly focused solutions while the localization applications contain innovations
    that are relatively high in novelty but need only a limited number of users to
    create immediate value which promotes their prompt implementation. Similar to
    how the knowledge associated with the average portfolio manager’s inability to
    generate abnormal returns has led investors to move capital into more passive
    index or exchange-traded fund solutions, we believe that ETFs could lead the transition
    towards a blockchain-based securities network by creating private blockchain solutions
    to facilitate local exchange in their products. ETFs are currently able to externalize
    the costs associated with their transactions and with the distribution of their
    investments, a next logical step is for the low-cost investment instruments to
    minimize the costs associated with processing and settling transactions in these
    securities, and to potentially externalize these costs as well. This could be
    done using the blockchain and the fact that the ETF managers match buyers and
    sellers of their ETFs makes a private blockchain network a meaningful and logical
    step towards a more efficient and cost-effective method to settle and process
    these transactions, especially with ETFs that trade frequently.

    purchasing securities over these private blockchain networks, we may be able to
    think about scale, network effects, and externalities that could result from public
    blockchain networks. Iansiti et al. [[25](#CR25)] highlighted how this single
    use and localized blockchain networks evolve into networks that act as potential
    substitutes for the incumbent methods that people rely on to transact and move
    towards transforming the industry. According to the authors, ‘substitution’ occurs
    when there is a high level of coordination and complexity associated with transactions,
    but the degree of novelty is low. Eventually, transformation occurs when the amount
    of complexity and coordination involved with transactions increases, but the degree
    of novelty also increases. When we think about substitution, we realize that there
    will be substantial barriers to changing how investors think about transacting
    over securities markets. As mentioned earlier in this paper, there are institutions
    that have a substantial vested interest in ensuring that things stay the same,
    that investors continue to transact over their platforms, and that the regulators
    that have the authority to devise rules and regulations that monitor transactions
    have no incentive to change how we transact, even if a new transaction mechanism
    could enhance the investor’s experience and increase efficiency. Further, Cichonczyk
    [[11](#CR11)] claims that disintermediation will probably never occur because
    the current market intermediaries are incentivized to overcome any potential disintermediation
    in the financial markets. Cohen [[12](#CR12)] points out what happened to the
    taxi industry as they failed to innovate and respond to advances in technology
    and watched their market power disappear as Uber disrupted their control over
    the ‘taxi-cab’ market, meaning that there is an opportunity to disrupt this market,
    but the question of who will disrupt it is very important. Public blockchain-based
    exchanges could be used as a substitute to the traditional brokered exchanges
    and this is the point of technological innovation at which this would begin to
    occur. During this step, we envision smaller private blockchain networks integrating
    into a more global public blockchain network but maintaining the traditional brokered
    exchanges so that investors are able to choose which medium they use to complete
    their transactions. As earlier examples of Australian Stock Exchange’s and Nasdaq’s
    move towards blockchain-based systems have illustrated, the first step towards
    innovation has occurred, but the transition from the private to public blockchain
    solution to the typical brokered exchange will likely take time.

    regulators, and investment professionals are going to need to embrace and adopt
    the use of the blockchain technology. More local introductions of blockchain-based
    systems similar to the ones illustrated in Kabi and Franqueira [[27](#CR27)] and

    surmounting to disintermediate securities markets and offer a global blockchain
    solution that would reduce cost and improve efficiency across the global financial
    markets. First, as securities transactions become more commoditized, regulators
    should look to install and adopt governance mechanisms that better facilitate
    global transactions as the current governance mechanisms create unnecessary costs
    and execution delays. Scalability seems to be the next challenge, as Chang et
    al. [[10](#CR10)] suggested, as even more advanced networks, such as Ethereum
    and Bitcoin, can only handle 20 transactions per second. However, according to
    Ventura [[48](#CR48)], some blockchain solutions can exceed 1 million transactions
    per second, so a solution could be built to solve some of the scalability issues.
    Security associated with the consensus mechanism is likely another challenge that
    a blockchain solution would have to solve. According to Reyna et al. [[43](#CR43)],
    there is a variety of security attacks (i.e., majority, double-spend, race, denial
    of service, and man in the middle attacks) that the builders of a system to facilitate
    trades across a global blockchain network should be aware of and protect against.
    Anonymity and privacy are also a concern; however, encrypting transactions could
    ensure anonymity [[10](#CR10), [43](#CR43)]. Finally, according to Chang et al.
    [[10](#CR10)] energy consumption associated with maintain a blockchain solution
    is a concern. For example, 3 Bitcoin transactions use as much energy as 300.000
    Visa transactions [[10](#CR10)]. Therefore, when developing a potential blockchain
    solution that would provide the infrastructure to facilitate securities market
    transactions over a global exchange the amount of energy and cost associated with
    consuming that energy should be considered. In summary, there is a number of challenges
    that developers and planners need to contend with before a global blockchain solution
    to facilitate securities market transactions is developed and deployed. However,
    these challenges do not seem insurmountable.

    public under the current regulatory regime and system and indicates how the economics
    of platforms might be used to think about implementing blockchain technologies
    more broadly to enhance the traditional process of exchange in securities markets.
    We argue that blockchain-based securities trading platforms should operate as
    a neutral party that straddles both sides of the market and act as a bridge between
    the supply-side and the demand-side and should not be positioned on one side of
    the transaction. Moving the blockchain-based platform from the supply-side to
    an intermediary position decreases the costs of the transaction for the customers
    and increases the potential for innovation in the process of securities market
    transactions. Implementation of open routing procedures should also positively
    impact the market in terms of welfare maximization and enhance efficiency.
