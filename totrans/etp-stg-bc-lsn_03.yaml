    is hobbled by performance drawbacks that create obstacles for adoption at the
    enterprise level. In consequence, enterprises are reluctant to attempt larger-scale
    rollouts even with successful proof of concepts in their pilot efforts. Established
    enterprises have encountered difficulties in advancing blockchain pilot projects
    to commercial implementation at scale. In 2019, Cathy Bessant, then chief technology
    officer at Bank of America, commented that the hype associated with blockchain
    outstripped reality. Wells Fargo’s former CEO Tim Sloan was equally skeptical,
    noting that “blockchain has been way oversold.”[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en50) Indifferent
    pilot results in many instances have dampened enthusiasm and created organizational
    hesitance and a “trough of disillusionment,” leading Gartner to pronounce that
    “through 2022, only 10 percent of enterprises will achieve any radical transformation
    with the use of blockchain technologies.” However, continued development could
    result in business value added from blockchain exceeding $3 trillion by 2030.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en51)
    Therefore, the drawbacks discussed do not negate blockchain’s ultimate advantages;
    instead, they signal its current immaturity as a potential disruptive technology—and
    that immaturity is not permanent.

    of the particular blockchain protocol adopted (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple,
    or Consensys Quorum) must interact with a second layer that consists of additional
    blockchain capabilities, which can vary from one protocol to another. This layer
    can include features such as smart contracts, SSI, and use of ZKP. These in turn
    interact with a proxy layer of software applications that includes application
    programming interfaces (APIs) and Dapps, which permit users to access different
    blockchain platforms. Also necessary are off-chain elements such as off-chain
    storage, the ability to exchange data with external networks and to communicate
    with information sources (“oracles”) to receive information to trigger automated
    smart contract execution, and interoperability capabilities. Blockchains must
    also manage external events such as data supplied by Internet of Things (IoT)
    microservices (whose provenance and accuracy may be insecure). These technological
    complexities can delay the move to blockchain as firms with less digital transformation
    experience face financial, knowledge, and human capital constraints. Incorrect
    implementation can compromise data accuracy and trust, negating blockchain utility.

    by three seemingly irreconcilable challenges that restrict its commercial potential:[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en52)
    it cannot simultaneously maximize security, scalability, and decentralization.
    Vitalik Buterin, a founder of the Ethereum blockchain, described this as the *scalability
    trilemma*, stating that blockchain, as constituted, *could only optimize two of
    the three parameters* of security, scalability, and decentralization. Users want
    secure networks to ensure that transactions are valid and to protect against double-spend
    and fraud. And if only a few entities are authorized to guarantee the trustworthiness
    of a blockchain network (a high degree of centralization), enterprises will have
    to assess the gains from using centralized networks against the consequences of
    depending on centralized trust guarantors, who represent potential points of failure.
    Extensive decentralization strengthens security, as do consensus algorithms, which
    create immutability through cryptographically assured blockchain validation, and
    allow reliance on the blockchain as the single source of truth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, decentralization leads to transactions recorded at all nodes of the
    network, making transactions visible to the entire network, reducing privacy,
    and making blockchain solutions less attractive for some enterprise applications.[4](14085-0014.xhtml#en53)
    Privacy can be protected with additional steps such as using new addresses for
    each transaction; combining transactions from several users; transacting via intermediaries;
    storing sensitive user information off-chain, possibly in a separate private blockchain;
    and linking such information via a hash to the specific transaction. Such steps
    would likely incur additional costs, reducing the incentive to adopt blockchain
    solutions.
  prefs: []

- en: Acting together, decentralization and consensus frameworks as designed in the
    classic blockchain algorithm can slow down block validation and transaction finality,
    thus hindering scalability. As the number of transactions increase, settlement
    takes longer. While it is possible to pay higher fees to give priority to a transaction,
    this would raise transaction processing costs. If consensus methods used to validate
    transactions and confirm payments are slow, users will seek faster alternatives.
    Centralizing authority in the blockchain to speed up transaction time may make
    the blockchain experience more appealing to users, but that speed comes at the
    expense of security. And for enterprises that transact in the billions of dollars
    in high-volume applications, security is essential.

    to use smart contracts. A major concern is whether contracts, legally enforceable
    agreements between contracting parties, have been correctly captured in code,
    a process that requires close collaboration between legal staff and blockchain
    programmers. When drafting legal contracts, language may be deliberately ambiguous
    to grant a range of flexibility to the parties in fulfilling contract performance.
    There is a risk that coders would incorrectly interpret legal language when developing
    smart contract code, which creates a need for an additional step to verify that
    the code correctly reflects its source contract. A second problem arises when
    incorrect or deliberately false information is supplied by external sources to
    the smart contract code, triggering execution under false pretenses and causing
    economic losses.

    introduce new blockchain innovations such as sharding and side chains. Sharding
    partitions a blockchain into shards, with each node only needing to update its
    portion of the blockchain, enabling faster processing speeds and improving scalability.[7](14085-0014.xhtml#en56)
    Sidechains are separate blockchains attached to the main blockchain, reducing
    the processing burden on the main chain and thus increasing its speed and scalability.[8](14085-0014.xhtml#en57)
    However, disagreements over the introduction of these newer technologies can cause
    performance variability and reduce performance. In such cases, previously validated
    blocks may no longer be compatible with the newer changed protocol—a “hard fork.”[9](14085-0014.xhtml#en58)
    A hard fork is a significant change to a blockchain protocol, creating a new branch
    of the blockchain such that once users begin using the new version, transactions
    validated by the older version are rejected. (However, forks may have value in
    the sense of incremental improvements, with a 2017 Deloitte report suggesting
    that forks are more likely to keep blockchain projects alive.)[10](14085-0014.xhtml#en59)

    well as how the protocol should be changed. Ultimately, disagreements over, and
    refusal to support, the fork would lead to a schism, a disintegration of blockchain
    membership, which would affect its utility going forward. In sum, governance disagreements
    can cause the blockchain to fall apart.

    security with trusted entities to validate transactions. This reduces decentralization
    and concentrates potential points of failure in a few trusted entities, compromising
    security. Nevertheless, many enterprise blockchains have opted for permissioned
    networks to improve on older intermediary-controlled networks, as in banking,
    without losing processing speed. An example is Ripple’s use of its unique node
    list (UNL), which restricts transaction validation and ledger updating to a few
    trusted nodes, with most of them initially controlled by Ripple.[13](14085-0014.xhtml#en62)
    It is important to note that if an attacker gains control of these trusted entities,
    they could validate erroneous transactions, enable double-spend, and authorize
    fraudulent transfers, destroying confidence in the network and reducing its utility.

    transaction. This would be analogous to processing credit card transactions, where
    a total monthly bill for a month’s accumulated transactions is presented and can
    be paid for as one amount. However, as noted earlier, the transfer between a sidechain
    and the mainchain can be a security weakness, requiring additional steps such
    as encrypted lockboxes between the sidechain and the mainchain, introducing time
    lags to verify sidechain transfers before releasing funds in the mainchain (to

    resolve the scalability problem in a secure, decentralized, and permissionless

    known to have untrustworthy network participants), which provides consensus validation
    using less computational power compared to the traditional PoW consensus mechanisms
    used in blockchains, resulting in speedier processing. Algorand also validates
    transactions in the order in which they occur rather than waiting to gather transactions
    into blocks and validate such blocks, thus ensuring immediate transaction finality.

    purchase native tokens and eventually earn reward tokens for participating in

    method, Algorand guards against malicious users with a two-step method. First,
    Algorand randomly selects a token owner, a network node, from among all token
    owners to create a block. That token owner is the only user aware of their block
    creation role. Next, Algorand randomly selects a set of token owners and provides
    them with information necessary to validate the new block. Token rewards are granted

    thus influence block creation or validation. The validation method is rapid, increasing

    capital for commercial real estate. The tokenization of these ownership stakes
    within a blockchain increases the security of ownership rights and exchange with
    immediate settlement and payment finality. Accepting digital assets as additional
    collateral lowers risk for the lender, allowing lenders in turn to charge lower
    rates of interest on borrowed amounts. The lower mortgage rate reduces the weighted
    cost of capital for the borrower and increases the viability of investing in commercial
    real estate, for example, obtaining higher net present value. Subdividing a large
    real estate investment into smaller tranches increases the liquidity of commercial
    real estate investments and allows cryptocurrency owners to diversify their portfolios
    while retaining the possibility of capturing any appreciation of their digital
    assets provided as collateral. These innovations help make the commercial real
    estate market more transparent, efficient, and accessible to a variety of investors
    from around the globe. Due diligence information—such as senior debt, liens, linked

    blockchains can only be connected one pair at a time, using specialized software
    developed for each such pair-wise communication. Such a tailored approach is unwieldy,

    automatically validated in another ledger either. As stated in a Quant Network

    and to compare relative performance, scalability, and security before settling
    on a particular platform. Blockchain deployment can happen faster as decision-makers
    are less constrained by the chosen blockchain protocol. Firms always have a way
    to migrate to a better solution if one becomes available later, and there is no
    risk of obsoleting previous investments in blockchain application development.
    Widely available interoperability creates backward compatibility, allowing firms
    to rely on a network of blockchains to collectively solve business problems across
    an ecosystem of firms with shared interests. Overledger also allows developers
    to build applications that work across multiple blockchains without the need to
    rewrite or port an existing application for other different blockchains. Applications
    are likewise stable across blockchains and easily move between different blockchain
    systems. Overledger has its own app store where new multichain applications can

    into a network. Polkadot makes it possible for users to draw on a network of specialized
    blockchains, each with a distinct set of best-in-class features, thus creating
    a network of blockchains purposefully united for the business needs of individual
    organizations. Unlike Overledger, Polkadot offers a relay chain on which multiple
    independent blockchains can exist and communicate, side by side. Figure 2.4 illustrates
    how its components coalesce around the relay chain.[23](14085-0014.xhtml#en72)

    sharding, scalability, upgradability, and transparent governance. Heterogenous
    sharding removes any requirement that various shards (partitions of the main blockchain)
    have identical specifications; as such, each shard can be designed with distinct
    features for the business purpose at hand. Cross-chain composability allows multiple
    data types to be sent between the shards. As Polkadot allows processing transactions
    in parallel (hence parallelized chains or “parachains”), scalability increases
    and is enhanced. Nested relay chains, which provide shared security, can increase
    the number of shards within the network, creating mini-Polkadots and further increasing
    scalability. (Ethereum plans a similar Ethereum 2.0 version upgrade, moving to
    proof of stake, to improve its scalability.) Polkadot architecture also ensures
    secure interoperability since “if one chain has a message reverted, all chains
    get reverted,”[24](14085-0014.xhtml#en73) thereby protecting the exchange of data
    from any corruption or theft.'

    easy upgradability since each blockchain in the connected network can be tailored
    to any use case, allowing for additional functionality to be added to a blockchain
    network without having to reengineer existing blockchain. It also emphasizes transparent
    governance as everyone who owns DOTs can propose a change in the protocol and
    vote on proposals, forestalling the prospect of contentious hard forks. Finally,
    Polkadot also allows blockchain to be upgraded and updated without having to fork,

    when centralized intermediaries control an individual’s information, the individual’s
    identity is not easily portable across different intermediaries for different

    permitted access to networks (and thus improve cyber security), and create trust
    by authorizing the transfer of an individual’s or entity’s data between different
    systems. If individuals could control and prove their identity, and if they had
    the authority to decide whether to offer the required trusted credentials (and

    centralized intermediaries and the risks inherent in relying on those intermediaries.

    lifetime control of fully portable digital identity. SSI will always be under
    the control of that individual and cannot be taken away, but control of SSI still
    requires the owner to build relationships with issuers of verifiable claims to
    establish trust in their SSI. However, blockchain can facilitate the creation
    of SSI by providing standard formats for digital credentials and verifying the
    ownership of public keys. Individuals can sign their digital documents with their
    private key and concomitantly determine the extent of access to their individualized
    data. Their public keys would then be registered in a blockchain to be discoverable
    and used to verify digital signatures. Given a goal of identity for all, the SSI
    service would need to function as a global public utility, available to all those
    wanting to establish identity, credentials issuers, and those attempting to verify
    identity. If SSI is specific to a blockchain and interoperability is not available,
    the utility of SSI will inevitably be limited.

    own data and control the sharing of their data for adequate recompense, thereby
    reducing the power that intermediaries such as Google and Facebook have over individuals.
    At the same time, SSIs also help lower the security risks associated with centralized
    repositories of customer data controlled by a few entities. The Sovrin Network
    is an attempt to provide such an SSI.[29](14085-0014.xhtml#en78) In addition to
    verifying digital signatures and establishing ownership, Sovrin offers a standard
    approach to verifying digital credentials provided by the verified owner. It aims
    to link credentials owners, trusted issuers of the credentials, and verifiers
    who seek to establish the truthfulness and provenance of a digital claim. While
    public key infrastructure (PKI) is widely used in verifying ownership of, say,
    a website, there are relatively few agents (trusted certificate authorities) who
    can link public keys with an author’s private key and certify ownership. Such
    services are costly and beyond the reach of most individuals. Sovrin resolves
    the cost and scarcity of PKIs by creating validator nodes with P2P private agents,
    who act on behalf of the credential’s owner to certify the accuracy of furnished

    to incorporate smart contracts. Many provide ready-to-use templates and development
    tools to build and implement smart contracts. Smart contracts can be triggered
    within a blockchain with information that indicates that contract requirements
    have been met, initiating a subsequent transaction such as a transfer of ownership
    and exchange of value. The secure and immutable character of data in a blockchain,
    the ability to track provenance, and the use of tokens native to the blockchain
    all help automate the execution of smart contracts. Automatically executed smart
    contracts save time, avoid redundant error checking, and free up capital otherwise
    tied up during dispute resolution.[32](14085-0014.xhtml#en81) However, smart contract
    execution within a blockchain cannot automatically initiate external events, such
    as payment from a bank account outside the blockchain.
  prefs: []

    market data (whether the stock price reached a level to trigger option exercise),
    or events (such as a tenant vacating a rental property in good condition and activating
    the return of the security deposit). The blockchain’s consensus protocols that
    help guarantee the security and immutability of data do not extend to data obtained
    by oracles from external sources.

    (and their smart contracts) with distinct APIs for different data sources, with
    each API being a standard communication channel between its data source and the
    blockchain. Centralized oracles can help resolve the security weakness inherent
    in linking with, obtaining, and communicating off-chain data needed by the smart
    contract. However, this requires that the user or entity trust that the information
    provided by their transacting partner is accurate and acceptable to activate financially
    significant contracts within a specified time frame. The central oracle could
    be hacked or go offline at critical times, becoming a single point of failure

    nodes within the Chainlink blockchain. These nodes can retrieve the same data
    point from multiple independent data sources. Multiple data sources reduce dependence
    on a single source of data, which could be hacked or ethically compromised, and
    guard against a sole data source being offline. The multiple data points can then
    be aggregated and reduced to a single reliable datapoint that can trigger the
    smart contract, using aggregation models such as calculating an average, discarding
    outliers, and estimating algorithms.

    oracles to be graded and receive reputation scores based on factors such as success
    rate, response time, and continuous availability. This reputation system matches
    oracle nodes to offer higher quality services and outdo competing oracles. Chainlink
    allows smart contracts to choose, based on reputation scores and minimum reputation
    thresholds, which oracles they will call on to obtain data before aggregating
    them, with reputation scores helpful in making choices. It also allows smart contracts
    to choose oracles that run TEEs so that the oracle nodes cannot see query details;
    given a password, a TEE oracle could access a proprietary data source, retrieve
    data, and enable other actions such as payments.

    for oracle services. Oracle nodes are required to deposit a negotiated amount
    of LINK within Chainlink to respond to a smart contract data query, and the deposit
    motivates the oracle nodes to provide quality service and high levels of uptime
    availability. However, an oracle node can lose its deposit if it “feeds outlier
    data or goes offline.”[34](14085-0014.xhtml#en83) Chainlink can be also used as

    could analyze past events to develop indicators about the predicted level of pests

    the cost of Helium services to the IoT community. A second issue is geographic
    coverage as the Hotspot Network must be matched to the geographical distribution
    of IoT devices. By essentially crowdsourcing the buildup of hotspots across the
    US and, later, other parts of the world, Helium Systems is expecting market forces
    to balance demand for IoT data transfer and the supply of hotspots to conduct
    such data transfer, without necessarily seeding the market. If this matching process
    is slow to occur, IoT users, for whom sensor data transfer is essential for their
    business purposes, might resort to alternative communication channels, and Helium’s
    innovation advantage might dissipate. Helium Network’s architecture is displayed
    in figure 2.7.

    and confident using blockchain. This will increase awareness of the risks attendant
    to the growing use of blockchain and create demand for insurance against theft
    by hackers, erroneous smart contract execution, or blockchain front-running.[42](14085-0014.xhtml#en91)
    (Front-running occurs when market makers and traders take advantage of their knowledge
    of incoming large orders, which are likely to influence prices, by taking a position
    before the execution of the large order, thus benefiting from the expected price
    change.) Professional blockchain software development firms and individuals might
    want professional liability coverage; large clients might seek surety bonds from
    their blockchain providers, particularly when usage is ongoing, as with TradeLens
    or decentralized finance applications.

    application risk. Consensys Diligence[43](14085-0014.xhtml#en92) is an application
    designed to audit smart contracts. It detects bugs and security vulnerabilities
    in blockchain project code during smart contracts development (i.e., coded flaws
    in permission structure) and departures from intended permissions. Fixing code
    during development is preferable as code errors that remain after commercial operations
    launch can have larger-scale consequences. EY (formerly Ernst & Young) offers
    a similar set of blockchain analyzer tools, which includes a test studio, as part
    of its Smart Contract & Token Review software suite. Users such as SolidBlock,
    an asset tokenization firm, have used this facility to customize smart contract
    tests against commonly experienced attacks and to simulate transactions and decentralized
    finance contracts on the public Ethereum blockchain, before public release.[44](14085-0014.xhtml#en93)
    In 2021, EY announced an incremental $100 million investment in such tools and
    to fund broad blockchain and crypto asset research.[45](14085-0014.xhtml#en94)

    contracts. Enterprise blockchains are likely to be permissioned, and governance
    is likely to include an administrator or administrative team with some level of
    centralized control. That person or team could have powers that include interrupting
    system functioning, upgrading a part or the entire system, and delaying actions.
    In such a situation, the administrator could become a point of vulnerability—hackers
    could gain access to administrator’s passwords and private keys, compromising
    the system.[46](14085-0014.xhtml#en95) Applying measures such as time delays before
    administrative changes are implemented or subjecting administrator actions to
    a decentralized team approval could attenuate risk.

- en: Blockchains and smart contracts also depend on external parties such as oracles
    for data to activate smart contracts, external tokens, third-party modules (such
    as special purpose smart contracts), and external exchanges. All such interactions
    need to be secured against hidden bugs. One interesting approach to this challenge
    is to offer bounties to capable hackers, who detect and disclose security holes
    and flaws to administrators before such deficiencies are exploited by attackers.
    Such bounty programs can be coupled with a variety of additional measures for
    added protection, for example, smart contract audits, structured methodology to
    detect flaws before deployment at scale, specialized security analysis, and checking
    against the Smart Contract Weakness Classification database registry of smart
    contract vulnerabilities.[47](14085-0014.xhtml#en96) Scenario planning and incidence
    response strategies should accompany any other mitigation measures to control
    damage from flaws and attacks.

    used to create market incentives for decentralized blockchain nodes. If tokens
    can be conceived of as votes, with individual nodes using tokens to voice their
    choice or opinion, then blockchains with native tokens can be used to create new
    decentralized forms of organization—a decentralized autonomous organization or
    DAO. Adding smart contracts allows blockchain-driven platforms to create new,
    borderless organizations that are sovereign and censor resistant, with participative
    decision-making and dispute resolution mechanisms all based on smart contracts.
    However, organizations must contend with difficulties such as voter apathy, bribery
    attacks, and plutocratic domination. Against this backdrop, DAO projects have
    attempted to ameliorate these flaws in member representation, seeking to “align
    the organization with stakeholders’ interests and improve cooperation and participation
    through game theoretic monetary incentives”[48](14085-0014.xhtml#en97) and to
    create “cooperatives in cyberspace.”

    organizations.[49](14085-0014.xhtml#en98) Each Aragon-based organization has a
    set of smart contracts that describe the organization’s stakeholders and their
    rights and privileges. If minority interests are to be protected, that is, if
    they can veto what might otherwise be a majority vote, smart contract rules must
    contain provisions outlining when a majority vote is insufficient. These steps
    can be structured as a series of smart contracts within the Aragon Network, which
    provides the infrastructure and services for Aragon platform members to assign
    roles, raise funds, adopt accounting practices, and vote on different proposed
    actions using tokens as votes.

- en: The Aragon organization structure can help avoid disputes. As an example, consider
    the finance function within an organization, which has sole access to the organization’s
    resources and can make payments to entities outside the organization but only
    if proposed by a member of the organization. Such payments must be within an established
    budget, and payment can only be made if authorized by a majority of members—voters.
    A vote request would be sent to the organization’s token manager, who would solicit
    all token holders, that is, the voters, and forward the results of the token holders’
    actions. The action approved by most of the token holders would prevail.

- en: This DAO model creates a degree of transparency for financial flows, permitting
    larger numbers of the DAO members to influence such flows. However, if some voters
    held more tokens, they would have greater influence over the vote outcomes—not
    unlike the situation in the United States, where mutual funds, exchange-traded
    funds (ETFs), and index funds collectively control most voting shares in US corporations—and
    effectively control the voting outcomes on major proposals put forth by these
    firms. Hence, if organizations wish to move to a DAO model, they must decide how
    to address the consequences of having dominant members with greater weight in
    voting rights. As with blockchain as a whole, DAO with token-based voting rights
    is in its early stages and will evolve gradually as it experiments with different
    token-granting incentive schemes, before gaining broader acceptance.

    over fair sharing of revenue among the several parties involved in creating and
    selling music, including the multiple revenue streams from distribution, publishing,
    streaming, sales, and licensing.[50](14085-0014.xhtml#en99) It also suffers from
    the unauthorized copying and distribution of these copies. In an attempt to address
    this issue, the Berklee College of Music, with MIT Connection Science, has spearheaded
    the Open Music Initiative.[51](14085-0014.xhtml#en100) Together, they have developed
    a multilayered open blockchain protocol for identifying music creators—the music
    metadata layer—and then linked this data to the licensing and royalties management
    layer—connecting music rights with licensing and payments due—and to the music
    virtual assets layer.

    Deploying these layers to cover the music ecosystem can pave the way for tracking
    usage and state changes, transfers, and eventual micropayments for access to such
    music assets distributed among the various rights holders. One such application
    from the Open Music Initiative is the RAIDAR licensing platform on blockchain,
    which allows rights holders, for example, music students at Berklee, to license
    their music to others such as to filmmakers, virtual reality apps, and video games.[53](14085-0014.xhtml#en102)

    to one authoritative metafile containing music creation data for that musical
    work. This metadata would include a cryptographic hash of the music digital file,
    and each metadata file would have a unique file identifier similar to the DOI
    (digital object identifier) used for text documents. Multiple versions of a musical
    work would have multiple different DOI numbers. Copies of the creation metadata
    registry would be stored in multiple unmodified open access searchable repositories
    and made available to the public, through APIs.

    be digitally signed by the music creator or authorized entity, using private-public
    key pairs, thus validating the metadata for inclusion in the blockchain. A shorter
    version of the metadata would be stored on the blockchain; timestamped, including
    a cryptographic hash of the full metadata file; and would have the same DOI. Such
    blockchain-based metadata could enable the identification of music creators, support
    their copyright claims, and provide “a relatively immutable and nonrepudiable
    timestamped public evidence of the existence of the musical work.”[54](14085-0014.xhtml#en103)

    rights ownership data as well as other confidential information. The musical content
    files and corresponding ownership rights information would reside in other layers
    but be linked to the creation metadata. Smart contracts could unambiguously link
    to the metadata of a song or track, facilitating licensing of the exact version
    in case multiple versions exist. Legacy systems could also rely on the blockchain
    registry data in referring to music content and ownership.

    foreseeable future, with a few trusted nodes, rendering unnecessary slow and computation-intensive
    consensus schemes. However, such limited decentralization creates concentrated
    points of failure; though with only a few members given permission to access the
    blockchain network, fear of ill-intentioned actors is reduced. Enterprises must
    balance learning and building on start-up initiatives with the pressures from
    operating within ecosystems with legacy systems and traditionally accepted best
    practices. This need for balance influences paths to commercial-scale blockchain
    implementation, discussed in the concluding chapter.
