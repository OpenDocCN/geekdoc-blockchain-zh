  zh: 技术障碍阻碍了区块链的采用及其解决方法
- en: As with many young, potentially disruptive, technologies, blockchain technology
    is hobbled by performance drawbacks that create obstacles for adoption at the
    enterprise level. In consequence, enterprises are reluctant to attempt larger-scale
    rollouts even with successful proof of concepts in their pilot efforts. Established
    enterprises have encountered difficulties in advancing blockchain pilot projects
    to commercial implementation at scale. In 2019, Cathy Bessant, then chief technology
    officer at Bank of America, commented that the hype associated with blockchain
    outstripped reality. Wells Fargo’s former CEO Tim Sloan was equally skeptical,
    noting that “blockchain has been way oversold.”[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en50) Indifferent
    pilot results in many instances have dampened enthusiasm and created organizational
    hesitance and a “trough of disillusionment,” leading Gartner to pronounce that
    “through 2022, only 10 percent of enterprises will achieve any radical transformation
    with the use of blockchain technologies.” However, continued development could
    result in business value added from blockchain exceeding $3 trillion by 2030.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en51)
    Therefore, the drawbacks discussed do not negate blockchain’s ultimate advantages;
    instead, they signal its current immaturity as a potential disruptive technology—and
    that immaturity is not permanent.

  zh: 与许多年轻的、有潜在颠覆性的技术一样，区块链技术受到性能缺陷的限制，这些缺陷在企业级应用中造成了障碍。因此，即使企业在试点努力中取得了成功的概念验证，它们也不愿意尝试更大规模的部署。成熟的企业在将区块链试点项目推进到商业大规模实施时遇到了困难。2019年，美国银行时任首席技术官凯西·贝桑特表示，与区块链相关的炒作超过了现实。富国银行前首席执行官蒂姆·斯隆同样持怀疑态度，他指出“区块链被过度推销了”。[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en50)
    多次冷漠的试点结果削弱了热情，创造了组织犹豫和“幻灭低谷”，导致Gartner预测“到2022年，只有10%的企业将通过使用区块链技术实现任何根本性的转型”。然而，持续的发展可能导致到2030年，区块链为业务增加的价值超过3万亿美元。[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en51)
    因此，所讨论的缺陷并不否定区块链的最终优势；相反，它们表明作为一种潜在的颠覆性技术，区块链目前还不够成熟——而这种不成熟并非永久性的。

    of the particular blockchain protocol adopted (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple,
    or Consensys Quorum) must interact with a second layer that consists of additional
    blockchain capabilities, which can vary from one protocol to another. This layer
    can include features such as smart contracts, SSI, and use of ZKP. These in turn
    interact with a proxy layer of software applications that includes application
    programming interfaces (APIs) and Dapps, which permit users to access different
    blockchain platforms. Also necessary are off-chain elements such as off-chain
    storage, the ability to exchange data with external networks and to communicate
    with information sources (“oracles”) to receive information to trigger automated
    smart contract execution, and interoperability capabilities. Blockchains must
    also manage external events such as data supplied by Internet of Things (IoT)
    microservices (whose provenance and accuracy may be insecure). These technological
    complexities can delay the move to blockchain as firms with less digital transformation
    experience face financial, knowledge, and human capital constraints. Incorrect
    implementation can compromise data accuracy and trust, negating blockchain utility.

    by three seemingly irreconcilable challenges that restrict its commercial potential:[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en52)
    it cannot simultaneously maximize security, scalability, and decentralization.
    Vitalik Buterin, a founder of the Ethereum blockchain, described this as the *scalability
    trilemma*, stating that blockchain, as constituted, *could only optimize two of
    the three parameters* of security, scalability, and decentralization. Users want
    secure networks to ensure that transactions are valid and to protect against double-spend
    and fraud. And if only a few entities are authorized to guarantee the trustworthiness
    of a blockchain network (a high degree of centralization), enterprises will have
    to assess the gains from using centralized networks against the consequences of
    depending on centralized trust guarantors, who represent potential points of failure.
    Extensive decentralization strengthens security, as do consensus algorithms, which
    create immutability through cryptographically assured blockchain validation, and
    allow reliance on the blockchain as the single source of truth.

    Privacy can be protected with additional steps such as using new addresses for
    each transaction; combining transactions from several users; transacting via intermediaries;
    storing sensitive user information off-chain, possibly in a separate private blockchain;

- en: Acting together, decentralization and consensus frameworks as designed in the
    classic blockchain algorithm can slow down block validation and transaction finality,
    thus hindering scalability. As the number of transactions increase, settlement
    takes longer. While it is possible to pay higher fees to give priority to a transaction,
    this would raise transaction processing costs. If consensus methods used to validate
    transactions and confirm payments are slow, users will seek faster alternatives.
    Centralizing authority in the blockchain to speed up transaction time may make
    the blockchain experience more appealing to users, but that speed comes at the
    expense of security. And for enterprises that transact in the billions of dollars
    in high-volume applications, security is essential.

- en: Blockchains can change their protocols to speed up transactions, for example,
    introduce new blockchain innovations such as sharding and side chains. Sharding
    partitions a blockchain into shards, with each node only needing to update its
    portion of the blockchain, enabling faster processing speeds and improving scalability.[7](14085-0014.xhtml#en56)
    Sidechains are separate blockchains attached to the main blockchain, reducing
    the processing burden on the main chain and thus increasing its speed and scalability.[8](14085-0014.xhtml#en57)
    However, disagreements over the introduction of these newer technologies can cause
    performance variability and reduce performance. In such cases, previously validated
    blocks may no longer be compatible with the newer changed protocol—a “hard fork.”[9](14085-0014.xhtml#en58)

    networks to improve on older intermediary-controlled networks, as in banking,
    without losing processing speed. An example is Ripple’s use of its unique node
    list (UNL), which restricts transaction validation and ledger updating to a few
    trusted nodes, with most of them initially controlled by Ripple.[13](14085-0014.xhtml#en62)
    It is important to note that if an attacker gains control of these trusted entities,

    fraudulent transfers, destroying confidence in the network and reducing its utility.

    transaction. This would be analogous to processing credit card transactions, where
    a total monthly bill for a month’s accumulated transactions is presented and can
    be paid for as one amount. However, as noted earlier, the transfer between a sidechain
    and the mainchain can be a security weakness, requiring additional steps such
    as encrypted lockboxes between the sidechain and the mainchain, introducing time
    lags to verify sidechain transfers before releasing funds in the mainchain (to

  zh: Algorand 引入了一种新的区块链协议[15](14085-0014.xhtml#en64) 来以一种安全、去中心化且无需授权的方式解决可扩展性问题。它的方法建立在一个新的协议上，即纯
    PoS（适应于已知存在不可信网络参与者的环境），它通过比区块链中使用的传统 PoW 共识机制更少的计算能力来提供共识验证，从而实现更快的处理速度。Algorand
    还按照事务发生的顺序验证事务，而不是等待将事务聚集到区块中再验证这些区块，从而确保事务的即时最终性。Algorand 的方法还保证了活性，这一特性有助于在设定的时间限制内验证正确的交易。
- en: Crucial to its approach is its native token, the Algo. Algorand network members
    purchase native tokens and eventually earn reward tokens for participating in
    the network’s block validation process. Using its tokens and its Pure PoS consensus
    method, Algorand guards against malicious users with a two-step method. First,
    Algorand randomly selects a token owner, a network node, from among all token
    owners to create a block. That token owner is the only user aware of their block
    creation role. Next, Algorand randomly selects a set of token owners and provides
    them with information necessary to validate the new block. Token rewards are granted
    for participating in this sortition process.

    共识方法，Algorand 用两步方法抵御恶意用户。首先，Algorand 从所有代币所有者中随机选择一个网络节点来创建区块。那个代币所有者是唯一知道他们区块创建角色的用户。接下来，Algorand
    随机选择了一组代币所有者，并提供他们必要的信息来验证新区块。代币奖励用于参与这种抽签过程。
- en: Both the block creation member (a network node) and the validating committee
    (other network nodes) are randomly and independently selected for each step and
    each block. Since neither the identity of the block creator nor that of the committee
    validating the block is known in advance, a malicious user cannot corrupt and
    thus influence block creation or validation. The validation method is rapid, increasing
    processing speed. Algorand does not have to sacrifice decentralization because
    users are also block producers and validators, they are picked randomly, and the
    user/validator pool is constantly updated.

    commercial real estate investment access and security as well as cryptocurrency
    challenges. Cryptocurrency digital assets held for appreciation do not yield immediate
    returns, and AssetBlock helps transform such idle assets into new sources of investment
    capital for commercial real estate. The tokenization of these ownership stakes
    within a blockchain increases the security of ownership rights and exchange with
    immediate settlement and payment finality. Accepting digital assets as additional
    collateral lowers risk for the lender, allowing lenders in turn to charge lower
    rates of interest on borrowed amounts. The lower mortgage rate reduces the weighted
    cost of capital for the borrower and increases the viability of investing in commercial
    real estate, for example, obtaining higher net present value. Subdividing a large
    real estate investment into smaller tranches increases the liquidity of commercial
    real estate investments and allows cryptocurrency owners to diversify their portfolios
    while retaining the possibility of capturing any appreciation of their digital
    assets provided as collateral. These innovations help make the commercial real
    estate market more transparent, efficient, and accessible to a variety of investors
    from around the globe. Due diligence information—such as senior debt, liens, linked

    against fraud, which helps lower loan processing fees.

    multiple smart contract languages and offering modularity in areas such as consensus
    schemes and privacy. Fabric is attractive to enterprises as it gives them more

    deployed. Interoperability allows firms to experiment with different blockchains
    and to compare relative performance, scalability, and security before settling
    on a particular platform. Blockchain deployment can happen faster as decision-makers
    are less constrained by the chosen blockchain protocol. Firms always have a way
    to migrate to a better solution if one becomes available later, and there is no
    risk of obsoleting previous investments in blockchain application development.
    Widely available interoperability creates backward compatibility, allowing firms

    lifetime control of fully portable digital identity. SSI will always be under
    the control of that individual and cannot be taken away, but control of SSI still
    requires the owner to build relationships with issuers of verifiable claims to
    establish trust in their SSI. However, blockchain can facilitate the creation
    of SSI by providing standard formats for digital credentials and verifying the
    ownership of public keys. Individuals can sign their digital documents with their
    private key and concomitantly determine the extent of access to their individualized
    data. Their public keys would then be registered in a blockchain to be discoverable
    and used to verify digital signatures. Given a goal of identity for all, the SSI
    service would need to function as a global public utility, available to all those
    wanting to establish identity, credentials issuers, and those attempting to verify
    identity. If SSI is specific to a blockchain and interoperability is not available,
    the utility of SSI will inevitably be limited.

    reducing the power that intermediaries such as Google and Facebook have over individuals.
    At the same time, SSIs also help lower the security risks associated with centralized
    repositories of customer data controlled by a few entities. The Sovrin Network
    is an attempt to provide such an SSI.[29](14085-0014.xhtml#en78) In addition to
    verifying digital signatures and establishing ownership, Sovrin offers a standard
    approach to verifying digital credentials provided by the verified owner. It aims
    to link credentials owners, trusted issuers of the credentials, and verifiers
    who seek to establish the truthfulness and provenance of a digital claim. While
    public key infrastructure (PKI) is widely used in verifying ownership of, say,
    a website, there are relatively few agents (trusted certificate authorities) who
    can link public keys with an author’s private key and certify ownership. Such
    services are costly and beyond the reach of most individuals. Sovrin resolves
    the cost and scarcity of PKIs by creating validator nodes with P2P private agents,
    who act on behalf of the credential’s owner to certify the accuracy of furnished
    credentials.

    to blockchains, IoT devices are ubiquitous, with an estimated twenty billion IoT
    devices in use in 2020.[39](14085-0014.xhtml#en88) All of these devices must communicate
    regularly, at specified time intervals, to provide updated sensor information
    and, when bidirectional links are an integral part of IoT deployment, to receive
    directions for action. However, IoT devices communicate small amounts of data
    and do not require the broadband capabilities and the higher cost of WiFi cellular
    networks. Helium is an innovator attempting to develop a two-sided market for
    IoT communication rooted in a P2P network, which it has tabbed as the “People’s
    Network.”[40](14085-0014.xhtml#en89)

- en: On the supply side (i.e., creating a network for IoT communication), Helium
    developed hotspots that could be linked together to create a decentralized wide-area
    network. Rather than Helium Systems building out a network of Helium Hotspots,
    entrepreneurs would purchase multiple hotspots from Helium and deploy them in
    a city, collectively setting up a Helium Network. WHIP, Helium’s secure, long-range,
    low-power, bidirectional wireless network protocol, allows the Helium Network
    to wirelessly connect to the internet at a significantly lower cost than cell
    networks. A key requirement is that the Hotspot owners must have a WiFi connection
    so that they can link up their hotspots to their existing WiFi router and be available
    to IoT devices for data transfer.

- en: The hotspots form part of the Helium Blockchain, with a new consensus protocol,
    Proof of Coverage, to ensure that the hotspots actually exist and are providing
    transmission coverage to IoT devices. Proof of Coverage protects against Sybil
    attacks and alternate reality attacks—where rogue hotspots simulate WiFi coverage
    and steal or divert IoT data and use the bidirectional capability to send malicious
    commands to the IoT devices. The Hotspot owners receive payments (in Helium HNT
    tokens) for transporting IoT data, transaction validation and inclusion in a block,
    and for participating in the Proof of Coverage consensus validation. Hotspots
    validate the IoT geolocation and also store the IoT transaction data along with
    the transaction’s fingerprint and timestamp, providing a tamperproof data and
    audit trail. All transaction data can be stored on the blockchain.

- en: On the demand side, low-powered IoT devices would use the LoRaWAN[41](14085-0014.xhtml#en90)
    protocol to communicate their information over a wide range (around ten miles)
    to any Hotspot in the network. The IoT devices are mapped to the company ID on
    the blockchain, becoming trusted devices and using private/public keys to encrypt
    data transmissions and be validated at the receiving end. IoT device owners do
    not pay a fee to join the Helium Network; they only pay for actual data transferred,
    a-pay-as-you-go system based on microtransactions for transferring small data
    packets. IoT users pay in Data Credits, which can be obtained by converting HNT
    tokens. The low-power consumption of the IoT devices extends battery life and
    hence their dependability. Other user advantages include easy connectivity to
    Helium Hotspots, the ability to pool data from multiple IoT devices, and an immutable
    record of secure, timestamped IoT location-verified transactions. Helium estimated
    that it would cost about $35 monthly for 2,500 IoT devices to transmit a data
    packet every thirty minutes. A sample application might be a company selling fresh,
    perishable pet food stored in IoT-equipped refrigerators, using the Helium Network
    to obtain temperature updates, stock status, and freshness levels.

    could interpret this reuse of the WiFi connection they provide as free riding.
    They could demand payment, set conditions for Helium Network access, and raise
    the cost of Helium services to the IoT community. A second issue is geographic
    coverage as the Hotspot Network must be matched to the geographical distribution
    of IoT devices. By essentially crowdsourcing the buildup of hotspots across the
    US and, later, other parts of the world, Helium Systems is expecting market forces
    to balance demand for IoT data transfer and the supply of hotspots to conduct
    such data transfer, without necessarily seeding the market. If this matching process
    is slow to occur, IoT users, for whom sensor data transfer is essential for their
    business purposes, might resort to alternative communication channels, and Helium’s
    innovation advantage might dissipate. Helium Network’s architecture is displayed

    contracts. Enterprise blockchains are likely to be permissioned, and governance
    is likely to include an administrator or administrative team with some level of
    centralized control. That person or team could have powers that include interrupting
    system functioning, upgrading a part or the entire system, and delaying actions.
    In such a situation, the administrator could become a point of vulnerability—hackers
    could gain access to administrator’s passwords and private keys, compromising
    the system.[46](14085-0014.xhtml#en95) Applying measures such as time delays before
    administrative changes are implemented or subjecting administrator actions to
    a decentralized team approval could attenuate risk.

    for data to activate smart contracts, external tokens, third-party modules (such
    as special purpose smart contracts), and external exchanges. All such interactions
    need to be secured against hidden bugs. One interesting approach to this challenge
    is to offer bounties to capable hackers, who detect and disclose security holes
    and flaws to administrators before such deficiencies are exploited by attackers.
    Such bounty programs can be coupled with a variety of additional measures for
    added protection, for example, smart contract audits, structured methodology to
    detect flaws before deployment at scale, specialized security analysis, and checking
    against the Smart Contract Weakness Classification database registry of smart
    contract vulnerabilities.[47](14085-0014.xhtml#en96) Scenario planning and incidence
    response strategies should accompany any other mitigation measures to control
    damage from flaws and attacks.

- en: Decentralization is an intrinsic aspect of blockchain, and tokens are commonly
    used to create market incentives for decentralized blockchain nodes. If tokens
    can be conceived of as votes, with individual nodes using tokens to voice their
    choice or opinion, then blockchains with native tokens can be used to create new
    decentralized forms of organization—a decentralized autonomous organization or
    DAO. Adding smart contracts allows blockchain-driven platforms to create new,
    borderless organizations that are sovereign and censor resistant, with participative
    decision-making and dispute resolution mechanisms all based on smart contracts.
    However, organizations must contend with difficulties such as voter apathy, bribery
    attacks, and plutocratic domination. Against this backdrop, DAO projects have
    attempted to ameliorate these flaws in member representation, seeking to “align
    the organization with stakeholders’ interests and improve cooperation and participation
    through game theoretic monetary incentives”[48](14085-0014.xhtml#en97) and to

    set of smart contracts that describe the organization’s stakeholders and their
    rights and privileges. If minority interests are to be protected, that is, if
    they can veto what might otherwise be a majority vote, smart contract rules must
    contain provisions outlining when a majority vote is insufficient. These steps
    can be structured as a series of smart contracts within the Aragon Network, which
    provides the infrastructure and services for Aragon platform members to assign
    roles, raise funds, adopt accounting practices, and vote on different proposed
    actions using tokens as votes.

    the finance function within an organization, which has sole access to the organization’s
    resources and can make payments to entities outside the organization but only
    if proposed by a member of the organization. Such payments must be within an established
    budget, and payment can only be made if authorized by a majority of members—voters.
    A vote request would be sent to the organization’s token manager, who would solicit
    all token holders, that is, the voters, and forward the results of the token holders’
    actions. The action approved by most of the token holders would prevail.

- en: This DAO model creates a degree of transparency for financial flows, permitting
    larger numbers of the DAO members to influence such flows. However, if some voters
    held more tokens, they would have greater influence over the vote outcomes—not
    unlike the situation in the United States, where mutual funds, exchange-traded
    funds (ETFs), and index funds collectively control most voting shares in US corporations—and
    effectively control the voting outcomes on major proposals put forth by these
    firms. Hence, if organizations wish to move to a DAO model, they must decide how
    to address the consequences of having dominant members with greater weight in
    voting rights. As with blockchain as a whole, DAO with token-based voting rights
    is in its early stages and will evolve gradually as it experiments with different
    token-granting incentive schemes, before gaining broader acceptance.

    the Open Music Initiative.[51](14085-0014.xhtml#en100) Together, they have developed
    a multilayered open blockchain protocol for identifying music creators—the music
    metadata layer—and then linked this data to the licensing and royalties management

    virtual assets layer.

    to the metadata of a song or track, facilitating licensing of the exact version
    in case multiple versions exist. Legacy systems could also rely on the blockchain
    registry data in referring to music content and ownership.
