- en: I’m really excited you’re here! You’re about to embark on a fascinating journey,
    one that I began in 2012\. I was interviewing famed futurist Ray Kurzweil for
    my PBS television show at his faculty office at Harvard. While chatting afterward,
    Ray encouraged me to attend the Executive Program at Singularity University. He
    cofounded the institution with Peter Diamandis to help world leaders learn how
    to apply technology to solve global challenges and build a better future for the
    planet. With Ray’s help, I was accepted into the nine-day, deep-dive program on
    exponential technologies. The course covers Artificial Intelligence, Robotics,
    Machine Learning, 3D Printing, Big Data, Nanotech, Biotech, Fintech, EdTech, AgriTech,
    and more.^([I](#footnote-075))

    It made no sense to me (despite—or because of—my knowledge and experience in the
    financial field). Nevertheless, I was intrigued. So, I explored bitcoin throughout
    2013 and began investing in 2014\. As my knowledge grew, and as I got to know
    many of the folks involved, I became acutely aware of two facts:'

    This is the most profound innovation in commerce since the invention of the internet.

    services, it hasn’t learned how to reach investors like you. And the bulk of the
    financial services industry, which in the United States manages two-thirds of
    all investors’ money, doesn’t fully realize the incredible investment opportunities
    available in this new asset class. Nor does the financial field yet know how to
    give its clients access to these opportunities.

- en: That’s why, in 2018, I created the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.
    Today, DACFP is widely regarded as the premier resource on this topic for Wall
    Street and corporate America. We are the bridge connecting the crypto community
    with the financial services field. Our role is to provide financial professionals
    with the education they need so they can explain these new technologies to their
    clients, helping everyone gain access to these investment opportunities. (Already,
    thousands of financial professionals have enrolled in DACFP’s program to attain
    their Certificate in Blockchain and Digital Assets.)

    executives on blockchain and digital assets. Ironically, the more investment knowledge
    and experience these folks have, the harder it is for them to comprehend this
    new asset class. Indeed, I’ve found that the more college degrees, professional
    designations, and years of investment and financial experience an individual has,
    the more they struggle with this topic. That’s simply because blockchain and digital
    assets technologies have nothing in common with anything financial professionals
    have learned about or experienced anywhere in their careers.

    and financial experience, then I urge you, as you read these pages, to set aside
    your well-earned knowledge and experience for a little while. I know that’s a
    big ask—I’ve got 37 years in the financial field and six professional designations
    myself, and if someone were to tell me to ignore what I know, well, yeah, I’d
    call that a big red flag. All I can say is that I understand how you feel. I felt
    the same way when I started exploring this new asset class, too. But I quickly
    learned that, instead of *helping*, my knowledge and experience were actually
    a hindrance. I had a lot of presumptions, expectations, and judgments to overcome.
    I now see that my initial resistance *interfered* with my journey toward comprehending
    this new technology and all it offers. So, you can either benefit from my experience
    and proceed as I suggest—which will save you a lot of time and aggravation—or
    you can trudge along as I did at first. Up to you.

    knowledgeable.^([II](#footnote-074)) The tech is new, and so are many of the words.
    They are often derived from or similar to familiar words and terms, but some are
    just bad jokes.

- en: First, there’s *Bitcoin* (capitalized). Then, there’s *bitcoin* (lowercase).
    *Bitcoin* refers to the computer network; *bitcoin* refers to the asset that’s
    used on the network. So, you buy and sell bitcoin on the Bitcoin network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, you can use *bitcoin* in the plural, but only in certain circumstances.
    You’ll notice how I handle it throughout this book. You’ll get the hang of it.
    But if in doubt, go with the singular; it’s more of *deer* and *deer* than *cat*
    and *cats*. As in “I own lots of bitcoin,” not “I own lots of bitcoins.”

- en: Also, it’s okay to say *crypto* when talking shop with fellow insiders, as I
    did 10 paragraphs ago. But generally, it’s better to use *digital.* It’s a lot
    friendlier than scary *crypto*, and, besides, everyone’s familiar with *digital*,
    since we now live in a digital world—Twitter and other social media; PayPal, Venmo,
    Zelle, and other online payment apps; Amazon and other online stores; and so on.

    the other. We’ll talk more about this in chapter 8\. For now, just realize that
    there is a difference.'

    is issued by a government but isn’t backed by anything (such as gold); instead,
    citizens put their faith in the government’s willingness and ability to support
    the currency. When a currency is backed by, say, gold (as the US dollar was prior
    to 1973), the amount of currency that can be printed is limited by the amount
    of gold held by the government. By replacing gold-backed currency with fiat currency,
    the central bank can more freely control how much money is printed. Today, just
    about every currency in the world, including the US dollar, is a fiat currency.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this would be the best way to attract readers,^([III](#footnote-000)) and I found
    it difficult to disagree. But hopefully, you now know why it’s best to stop using
    the term.

    we have invested in the company sponsoring those investments. Finally, some companies
