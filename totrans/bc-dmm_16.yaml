    potential of blockchain to transform the industry. The banking sector is highly
    regulated, and the fees to organize and operate as a bank are expensive. These
    heavy regulations have been an insulating and protective shield for the whole
    industry, as well as a burden. The application of fast, efficient, digital money
    that doesn’t carry the cost of handling cash and that is traceable as it moves
    through the financial system was an intoxicating and threatening proposal. The
    idea that value can be held outside the control of central authorities also piqued
    the interest of financial institutions and governments that back currencies.

    high returns and would not be skeptical enough of the new investment space that
    was so novel and cutting-edge. According to the SEC, digital currency was one
    of the top ten threats to investors. Today, the SEC stands ready to engage with
    companies and investors as cryptocurrency gains traction within all industries.

    Australia, and China — began investigating how they could create their own digital
    currencies, seizing cryptocurrency for themselves and put money on the blockchain.
    The turning point was when they began to perceive that the benefits started outweighing
    the risks. Bitcoin had been able to stand up to hackers for several years, even
    when many government systems were compromised, making it an appealing system to

    challenges to overcome first. In order to stay compliant with KYC and AML regulations,
    they need to know the identity of all the individuals utilizing their currency.
