    assets it has engendered, may be moving us toward a model of programmable money
    that incorporates an automated internal governance of common resources and encourages
    collaboration among communities. Digital scarcity, when applied to these tokens,
    treats our increasingly digitized economy differently from the pre-digital one.
    It raises the possibility that our money itself becomes the tool for achieving
    common outcomes.

    and bandwidth, for example, but also human qualities such as audience attention
    for online content or fact-checkers’ honesty. Whereas media coverage has focused
    on the billions of dollars these token issuers have raised, it’s the radical new
    economic design that promises a lasting impact on society. Once a community associates
    scarce tokens with rights to these resources, it can develop controls over token
    usage that help manage public goods. It’s dynamic money whose role extends beyond
    that of a unit of exchange, money that’s a direct tool for achieving community
    objectives.

    one of those late-stage exponential rallies that never ends well.

    capitalization to a staggering $830 billion in early January 2018, history’s lessons
    were confirmed as the market did a brutal one-eighty. The price of everything
    collapsed as the once virtuous circle of self-reinforcing demand for ether and
    tokens turned into its converse, and a vicious cycle of loss-covering sales pushed
    prices to the floor.

    with very public displays of decadence were displaced by the “told you so” bears:
    lawyers who’d warned that, within the flood of ICOs, most were more than likely
    illegal; developers who’d dug into the projects and discovered many built on plagiarized
    white papers or, at best, flimsy forked code; and seasoned investors who’d predicted
    that those taking the “greater fool” approach to investing would face their day
    of reckoning.'

    public eye. With mainstream press focused singularly on roller-coaster price activity
    of cryptoassets, the powerful idea that tokens could fuel decentralized platforms
    and run protocols that incentivized individual behavior toward common objectives
    hardly got coverage. Instead, the talk was of Tulip Mania, of fortunes lost, of
    lessons learned the hard way.

    cases against ICO issuers, clarified that most, if not all, the token offerings
    that had come to market in the 2016–2018 wave, were securities offerings. Since
    the vast majority had not been registered as such and were sold to the public
    without the appropriate protections and warnings, founders remained vulnerable
    to legal action unless they’d taken stringent measures to keep their tokens out
    of the hands of American investors.

    the frictions, trust barriers, and rent-seeking that inhibit the centralized global
    economy—was far from dead. There was a shift to security tokens, established either
    as digital claims on real-world assets such as real estate or bonds, or offered
    to the public in security token offerings (STOs) in venture fundraising, all on
    the understanding that they would be fully compliant with securities regulations.

    and Santander sold blockchain-based bonds, as did the World Bank. Also adopting
    it were start-ups such as Blockstack, which raised $23 million in a first-of-its-kind,
    SEC-approved public STO of its “stacks” tokens, the proceeds of which were to
    be used to build out the architecture of its decentralized Internet software.

    the concept that ignited the ICO boom—the notion of a digital unit that takes
    it value not from some defined asset such as a building or a claim on future earnings
    such as bond or a stock but from its purpose within the blockchain network itself.
    Utility tokens hold the real promise of decentralization because they regulate
    the behavior of all participants in the system, through incentives and costs rather
    than through a centralized entity.

    almost impossible to identify a utility value in tokens that were sold on the
    open market before their network was built. By default, that meant regulators
    would view those initial offerings as speculative investment contracts and, by
    extension, as sales of unregistered securities. There was a timing issue. How
    does a token become a utility token? How does it lose its security status?'

    not always use the latter phrase.

    William Hinman laid out a case for how a token that was native to a blockchain
    could evolve over time from being a security at its outset to losing that status
    as its underlying network and functionality grew. His remarks were interpreted
    as a sign that the SEC viewed Ethereum’s initial offering of ether tokens as an
    unregistered security token but that ether could not be traded freely on exchanges
    without requiring such compliance.⁹⁸

    agreement for future token (SAFT) vehicle designed by Cooley LLP to help start-ups

    It’s still unclear where the SEC stands on the SAFT.

    software applications raised more than $1.6 billion via a new tool dubbed the
    ICO that was first launched in early 2014.⁹⁹ By late July 2017, secondary-market
    trading in the tokens they’d issued had given the pool of cryptocurrencies, crypto-commodities,

- en: In his influential essay, “Tragedy of the Commons,” about 19th-century farmers
    grazing their cows on common land, the ecologist Garrett Hardin posited that communities
    that depend on a shared, unregulated resource will ultimately deplete it as individuals
    are incentivized to pursue self-interest to the detriment of the common good.¹⁰⁰
    Hardin recognized a coordination problem caused by a lack of trust, where well-meaning
    actors can’t avoid overusing a common resource due to their concern that others
    might “free-ride” on their goodwill.
  prefs: []

    resources such as land, water, and food supplies but also to human-created resources
    such as public infrastructure, and even intangible concepts such as free speech.
    It is now used frequently in the context of designing policies to ensure free,
    public access to those resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the years, Hardin’s thesis has been used to justify the role of external
    governance—that is, the state—in regulating and protecting scarce resources that
    constitute a public good. Yet, more recently, some economists have demonstrated
    that his rather cynical view of human nature doesn’t always hold true. In particular,
    the late Elinor Ostrom, who won a Nobel Prize in 2009 for her work studying how
    fishermen in Maine self-organized to develop ingrained norms of behavior that
    helped protect the region’s lobster fishery, argued that various communities have
    proven capable of coming up with effective internal governance to manage resources.
    However, while there are many instances of such common-interest practices around
    the world, their success relies more on art than science. Internal governance
    is often contingent on common cultural practices and close personal ties within
    a community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing a universal model for internal governance has been challenging, especially
    within the many microeconomic settings in which it is difficult to identify and
    practically regulate misuse of the common resource. Now, with the advent of blockchain
    technology and the cryptocurrencies, cryptotokens, and other digital assets that
    it has engendered, we may be moving toward a model of programmable money that
    can deliver a more automated system of internal governance over common resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a community incorporates programmable software into its shared medium of
    exchange, it can embed usage rules straight into the monetary unit itself. We
    can use it for some transactions but not for others, and we can program its value
    to rise in concert with proof of an improvement in the state of the public resource.
    Tokens thus offer a way to codify into money itself a function that executes the
    community’s expectations regarding people’s distinct rights to common property
    and the associated obligations that come with those.

    of access, withdrawal, management, exclusion, and alienation.¹⁰¹ If we can capture
    these quasi-legal notions in a token, it becomes a meta-asset, a thing of value
    that is simultaneously a governance vehicle. It’s money with a dynamic use that
    extends beyond its role as a stable and exchangeable unit of value, to a direct
    means of achieving community objectives. The great promise of the token economy
    is that it might solve the Tragedy of the Commons.

    speculative mania, is driving explosive investment in these meta-assets. Between
    2016 and mid-2017, developers of new decentralized software applications sold
    $1.6 billion worth of these tokens in ICO events. In the secondary market, this
    new class of cryptoassets has soared in value, with the collective market capitalization
    surging from $7 billion at the end of 2015 to a peak of $148 billion in mid-2017,

    the midst of a spectacular bubble and overdue for a major sell-off. In one noteworthy
    ICO, a project called Gnosis—which intends to let people trade tokens in a market

    Tragedy of the Commons can be traced to bitcoin, the very first cryptotoken. Not
    only did this invention turn the imagination of thousands of developers toward
    designing applications for a decentralized, disintermediated economic future,
    it also established a precedent for the software-driven internal governance of
    a scarce public resource. In coming up with the blockchain, a distributed public
    ledger that a community of currency users could share as their record of the truth,
    Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, created a public good, a commons
    in need of protection.

    other words, to engage in digital counterfeiting. There was no centralized authority
    to keep all the actors honest, no external governance, which had been the failure
    point for all prior attempts to create a decentralized currency with no centralized
    authority in charge. Without such an authority, a permissionless ledger that did
    not require identification of the user was always vulnerable to these abuses.

    simultaneously seeking profits out of self-interest. The key was a special proof-of-work
    (PoW) algorithm that compelled miners to perform an electricity-burning computation
    task before they could earn the right to receive bitcoin rewards. That “skin in
    the game” made it prohibitively expensive to take over the network and doctor
    the results. It incentivized them to come to a consensus on a truthful ledger
    with all the other miners. It was a unique marriage of self and common interest.

    of the (uppercase B) Bitcoin ledger and protects against double-spending of (lowercase

    For the first time, we have a form of digital value that cannot be replicated—unlike
    a Word document, an MP3 song, a video, or any other software vehicle for transmitting

    for bitcoin rewards, and that creates a barrier to entry for smaller, less wealthy

    RAM than does Bitcoin’s algorithm; computers cannot easily exploit the massive
    raw hashing speed of the parallel processing functions that ASIC machines’ specialized
    chips permit. In theory, that should mitigate the trend toward concentrated mining
    power because smaller players using cheaper, RAM-dependent graphics processing
    units (GPUs), can still compete. The design has not been entirely “ASIC-resistant,”
    as ASIC rigs for mining litecoins are now available. But Scrypt’s “memory hard
    problem” has nonetheless curtailed the trend toward a Bitcoin-like industrialized
    arms race in mining.

    will on average resolve their computing challenge and finalize a block of transactions
    every 2.5 minutes, whereas Bitcoin blocks take 10 minutes. Users wait a shorter
    time for the confirmation of transactions. It also accelerates the issuance of
    tokens; but, since Lee wanted a money supply schedule similar to Bitcoin’s, he
    adjusted the monetary policy so that the total future issuance would run to 84
    million coins, as opposed to Bitcoin’s 21 million, and set the halving of the
    litecoin payout reward to every 840,000 blocks. In effect, we can make fairly
    accurate price comparisons between litecoin and bitcoin by multiplying litecoin’s
    price by four or by comparing total market capitalization. As of late July 2017,
    Litecoin had a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com—a

    protocol rule set. That was evident in the relative lack of discord between miners
    and developers over Litecoin’s move to adopt SegWit, which soon paved the way
    for Lightning Network integration. Litecoin miners seemed to recognize that a
    SegWit-led scaling improvement would drive up the cryptocurrency’s price, which
    would more than offset the lost fees over which Bitcoin miners fretted. Sure enough,

    allow computers to confirm that a change in the state of a ledger has legitimately

    prove that funds weren’t being double-spent without knowing addresses involved
    in the transaction. So, these developers got to work on the problem, the outcome

    business logic whose event-contingent terms and conditions are executed automatically
    and securely by a decentralized computing network. For example, if the price of
    a certain stock fell below a certain price, a digitally executed contract would
    instruct payments to go from one investor to another. When these agreements are
    written to an immutable blockchain, parties to the contract can now trust that
    no other party can intervene in the automatic execution of their rights and obligations.

    decides upon the direction of development.”¹³⁴ To deal with those challenges,

    He modeled it on the game Nomic, invented by philosopher Peter Suber, in which
    the rules of the game include mechanisms for the players to change those rules.

    vote on the worthiness of domains added to that registry via a time-lock voting

    achieve this, token issuers, investors, exchanges, industry users, and any other
    stakeholders in this emerging industry need to engage with each other, as well
    as with regulators, to carve out a robust framework for ongoing development that’s
    not burdened by legal constraints.

    come to market with no prewritten codebase for their Dapp protocol and little
    more than a vaguely worded white paper explaining the idea. Yet these vaporware
    products, as cynics sometimes label them, can still fundraise seven figures. Even
    when there is comprehensive software development to point to, there’s a serious
    shortage of vetting done—in part because blockchain technology is quite complicated,
    but also because there’s little in the way of institutional analysis services
    to aid investors who are operating in the dark.

    found serious bugs in the proprietary hashing algorithm used by IOTA, a bold new
    blockchain solution for Internet of Things transactions whose token is one of
    the most valuable listings. IOTA has struck deals with major companies such as
    Bosch and has a large global community of developers testing its tangle protocol
    for sending and confirming transactions between devices.

    rule of “rolling their own crypto” rather using existing, tested algorithms, until
    the MIT team tested it.¹⁶¹ It’s likely that bugs are riddled through many of the
    Dapp protocols that support the tokens people have invested in. We need a more

    service created by Juan Benet’s Protocol Labs, the developer of IPFS and Filecoin,
    and Naval Ravikant’s AngelList. It offers a platform for token issuers to reach
    a network of investors but is promising to be highly selective about which tokens
    it supports, which is leading to expectations that CoinList-issued tokens will
    carry a de facto stamp of approval.¹⁶² Notably, CoinList is also favoring the
    SAFT option developed by Cooley LLP, which was the case with Filecoin, the highly
    successful first CoinList offering. That means it is for now limiting the ICOs
    it supports to those that sell exclusively to accredited investors.

    have accumulated and for which they were criticized in the wake of the global

    and “Positive” with “+” or “-” modifiers. The ratings’ components consist of a
    “risk score,” a “hype score,” and an “investment potential” score. Separately,
    ICORating gives outright “scam” labels to certain egregiously managed ICOs. The
    service provides fairly comprehensive reports, explaining the rationale for its
    ratings, which may boost the perception of objectivity.

    of “who’s auditing the auditors” will likely arise toward ratings services like
    these. Expect pressure for blockchain-based audit logs that might enhance the
    transparency of the ratings process. Drawing from some of the ideas within the
    token industry, such as prediction markets and reputation tokens, there may be
    an option to create market-based bounty systems for smart coders and auditors

    to market. But with major business publications like Forbes and The Wall Street
    Journal recently creating full-time cryptocurrency and blockchain beats, the landscape
    is slowly changing. Meanwhile, newsletter services like the Token Report, launched
    by Galen Moore and early Bitcoin pioneer Peter Vessenes, are also starting to
    emerge, responding to demand from the emerging professional investor class with

    the influx of VC and hedge-fund money into the ICO and token issuance market could
    be a positive, stabilizing effect. Big-name VC firms such as Andreessen Horowitz,
    Sequoia Capital, Union Square Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners had put
    a total of $245 million into two hedge funds geared to this market as of late
    summer 2017\. One of those, MetaStable Capital, was founded in 2014 by AngelList
    CEO Naval Ravikant, among others. The other, Polychain, which started in 2015
    with a $200 million funding round, was launched by Olaf Carlson-Wee, who was bitcoin

    More recently, some 15 different hedge funds have said they are going to be dedicated

    should bring. As of now, there are very few standards that issuers are expected
    to abide by—given the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency addresses, there is
    widespread suspicion that many secretly support their own tokens during the ICO
    to prop up the price. But it’s now clear how investors, professional or otherwise,
    can exert pressure through tokens. The nature of token investment is that they
    don’t get any say in governance—these are not shares; there is no prospect of
    a VC tokenholder getting a seat on the managing start-up’s board.

    a buy-and-hold strategy and won’t have the same conduit for providing advice and
    leadership to the platform developers. It will be up to the issuers to keep them
    and the wider investor community happy through good-faith actions. If these professional
    investors can be convinced to hold for the long term, everyone in the wider ecosystem
    of token development should benefit.

    firms taking a position in this area include Perkins Coie, BakerHostetler, Debevoise

    the dollars and cents can become a distraction. It’s inevitable that headlines
    will focus on nine-figure crowdfunding exercises that are over in a matter of
    minutes. In this chapter, we’ve tried to avoid that temptation and focus on the
    real economic potential for tokens themselves. We’ve framed that potential in
    terms of solving the Tragedy of Commons problem and believe that this potential
    captures the prospect of a global impact far greater and more important than the
    fortunes that are being made and that could soon be lost.

    These include a wider array of independent analysis services, objective ratings,

    have attracted nine million developers with an ability in that programming language,
    the community of dedicated blockchain engineers numbered no more than 5,000 in
    April 2016, according to estimates by William Mougayar, though he also suggested
