  zh: 代币经济简介
- en: •Blockchain technology, and the cryptocurrencies, tokens, and other digital
    assets it has engendered, may be moving us toward a model of programmable money
    that incorporates an automated internal governance of common resources and encourages
    collaboration among communities. Digital scarcity, when applied to these tokens,
    treats our increasingly digitized economy differently from the pre-digital one.
    It raises the possibility that our money itself becomes the tool for achieving
    common outcomes.

  zh: •区块链技术以及它衍生的加密货币、代币和其他数字资产，可能正在将我们带向一个可编程货币的模式，其中包括对共同资源进行自动内部治理，并鼓励社区之间的合作。数字稀缺性，当应用于这些代币时，将我们日益数字化的经济与之前的非数字化经济区分开来。它引发了这样一种可能性，即我们的货币本身成为实现共同结果的工具。
- en: •Developers of new decentralized applications are tokenizing all manner of resources—electricity
    and bandwidth, for example, but also human qualities such as audience attention
    for online content or fact-checkers’ honesty. Whereas media coverage has focused
    on the billions of dollars these token issuers have raised, it’s the radical new
    economic design that promises a lasting impact on society. Once a community associates
    scarce tokens with rights to these resources, it can develop controls over token
    usage that help manage public goods. It’s dynamic money whose role extends beyond
    that of a unit of exchange, money that’s a direct tool for achieving community
    objectives.

  zh: •新的去中心化应用程序的开发者正在将各种资源进行代币化——例如电力和带宽，但也包括人类的品质，比如在线内容的观众关注度或事实核查者的诚实度。虽然媒体报道集中在这些代币发行者筹集的数十亿美元上，但承诺对社会产生持久影响的是其激进的新经济设计。一旦一个社区将稀缺的代币与这些资源的权利联系起来，它就可以开发对代币使用的控制，以帮助管理公共产品。它是一种具有动态性的货币，其角色超越了交换单位的作用，是一种直接用于实现社区目标的货币。
- en: •This chapter explores the far-reaching implications of imbuing digital money
    with policy and incentives. We can envisage a future of digital barter in which
    different assets are traded directly and people no longer need to store a common
    currency like the dollar or even bitcoin. The token economy might even free people
    from the economic distortions and periodic crises that centralized monetary systems
    have experienced through the centuries.

    looming threat stands as a call for stricter governance measures to protect investors
    and users. But the token phenomenon has piqued the collective imagination of hundreds

    one of those late-stage exponential rallies that never ends well.

- en: Predictably, after that spectacular boom had taken the cryptocurrency market
    capitalization to a staggering $830 billion in early January 2018, history’s lessons
    were confirmed as the market did a brutal one-eighty. The price of everything
    collapsed as the once virtuous circle of self-reinforcing demand for ether and
    tokens turned into its converse, and a vicious cycle of loss-covering sales pushed
    prices to the floor.

    with very public displays of decadence were displaced by the “told you so” bears:
    lawyers who’d warned that, within the flood of ICOs, most were more than likely
    illegal; developers who’d dug into the projects and discovered many built on plagiarized
    white papers or, at best, flimsy forked code; and seasoned investors who’d predicted
    that those taking the “greater fool” approach to investing would face their day

- en: The whole affair significantly set back the standing of cryptoeconomics in the
    public eye. With mainstream press focused singularly on roller-coaster price activity
    of cryptoassets, the powerful idea that tokens could fuel decentralized platforms
    and run protocols that incentivized individual behavior toward common objectives
    hardly got coverage. Instead, the talk was of Tulip Mania, of fortunes lost, of
    lessons learned the hard way.

- en: Meanwhile, the SEC, in a series of guidance statements followed by numerous
    cases against ICO issuers, clarified that most, if not all, the token offerings
    that had come to market in the 2016–2018 wave, were securities offerings. Since
    the vast majority had not been registered as such and were sold to the public
    without the appropriate protections and warnings, founders remained vulnerable
    to legal action unless they’d taken stringent measures to keep their tokens out
    of the hands of American investors.

  zh: 与此同时，SEC在一系列指导性声明和对ICO发行者的诉讼案件后澄清，2016年至2018年浪潮中上市的大部分代币发行都是证券发行。由于绝大多数代币没有按照要求注册，并且在未提供适当的保护和警告的情况下向公众出售，创始人们仍然容易受到法律诉讼的攻击，除非他们采取了严格的措施阻止他们的代币落入美国投资者手中。
- en: But the core idea that tokens promise new efficiencies—that they could overcome
    the frictions, trust barriers, and rent-seeking that inhibit the centralized global
    economy—was far from dead. There was a shift to security tokens, established either
    as digital claims on real-world assets such as real estate or bonds, or offered
    to the public in security token offerings (STOs) in venture fundraising, all on
    the understanding that they would be fully compliant with securities regulations.

  zh: 但是，代币所承诺的新效率的核心理念——它们可以克服抑制中心化全球经济的摩擦、信任壁垒和寻租行为——远未消失。转向了安全代币，这些代币要么作为对现实世界资产（如房地产或债券）的数字化索赔而设立，要么以证券代币发行（STOs）的形式向公众提供，用于风险投资筹款，前提是它们将完全符合证券监管规定。
- en: The concept took on with financial institutions. Banks such as Société Générale
    and Santander sold blockchain-based bonds, as did the World Bank. Also adopting
    it were start-ups such as Blockstack, which raised $23 million in a first-of-its-kind,
    SEC-approved public STO of its “stacks” tokens, the proceeds of which were to
    be used to build out the architecture of its decentralized Internet software.

- en: Still, the real promise lay in the far more radical idea of a utility token,
    the concept that ignited the ICO boom—the notion of a digital unit that takes
    it value not from some defined asset such as a building or a claim on future earnings
    such as bond or a stock but from its purpose within the blockchain network itself.
    Utility tokens hold the real promise of decentralization because they regulate
    the behavior of all participants in the system, through incentives and costs rather
    than through a centralized entity.

  zh: 尽管如此，真正的希望在于更加激进的公用事业代币概念，这个概念引发了 ICO 繁荣——数字单位的概念不是来自于某种定义好的资产，比如房屋或者未来收益索赔，比如债券或者股票，而是来自于它在区块链网络内的作用。公用事业代币承载着真正的去中心化希望，因为它们通过激励和成本而不是通过集中式实体来调节系统中所有参与者的行为。
- en: 'The ICO boom and bust, however, revealed a chicken-and-egg problem: it was
    almost impossible to identify a utility value in tokens that were sold on the
    open market before their network was built. By default, that meant regulators
    would view those initial offerings as speculative investment contracts and, by
    extension, as sales of unregistered securities. There was a timing issue. How
    does a token become a utility token? How does it lose its security status?'

- en: Influential legal minds, including some from the regulatory sector, have been
    tackling those questions. Securities regulators in several countries (e.g., Singapore
    and Switzerland) issued guidelines to define explicitly which types of tokens
    would constitute securities and which ones were utility tokens, though they did

- en: In an important speech, Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance
    William Hinman laid out a case for how a token that was native to a blockchain
    could evolve over time from being a security at its outset to losing that status
    as its underlying network and functionality grew. His remarks were interpreted
    as a sign that the SEC viewed Ethereum’s initial offering of ether tokens as an
    unregistered security token but that ether could not be traded freely on exchanges
    without requiring such compliance.⁹⁸

    governance—that is, the state—in regulating and protecting scarce resources that

    that his rather cynical view of human nature doesn’t always hold true. In particular,
    the late Elinor Ostrom, who won a Nobel Prize in 2009 for her work studying how
    fishermen in Maine self-organized to develop ingrained norms of behavior that
    helped protect the region’s lobster fishery, argued that various communities have
    proven capable of coming up with effective internal governance to manage resources.
    However, while there are many instances of such common-interest practices around

    raw hashing speed of the parallel processing functions that ASIC machines’ specialized
    chips permit. In theory, that should mitigate the trend toward concentrated mining
    power because smaller players using cheaper, RAM-dependent graphics processing
    units (GPUs), can still compete. The design has not been entirely “ASIC-resistant,”
    as ASIC rigs for mining litecoins are now available. But Scrypt’s “memory hard
    problem” has nonetheless curtailed the trend toward a Bitcoin-like industrialized
    arms race in mining.

- en: Another distinction is that Litecoin’s PoW algorithm is designed so that miners
    will on average resolve their computing challenge and finalize a block of transactions
    every 2.5 minutes, whereas Bitcoin blocks take 10 minutes. Users wait a shorter
    time for the confirmation of transactions. It also accelerates the issuance of
    tokens; but, since Lee wanted a money supply schedule similar to Bitcoin’s, he
    adjusted the monetary policy so that the total future issuance would run to 84
    million coins, as opposed to Bitcoin’s 21 million, and set the halving of the
    litecoin payout reward to every 840,000 blocks. In effect, we can make fairly
    accurate price comparisons between litecoin and bitcoin by multiplying litecoin’s
    price by four or by comparing total market capitalization. As of late July 2017,
    Litecoin had a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com—a

    updates to the protocol without getting bogged down in the slanging matches and
    gridlock that afflicted the Bitcoin community. Updates also go through a rigorous
    testing process, which smart contracts must pass before they are implemented across
    the entire blockchain. Stakeholders can put the governance itself to this tiered
    voting and testing process, which means the mechanisms and rules by which updates
    are incorporated can also change—with something akin to a constitutional amendment.
    It’s called “on-chain governance.”

    votes do sometimes happen, they are typically an afterthought and do not proceed
    from a predictable set of governance rules.” Buterin, on the other hand, maintains

    it supports, which is leading to expectations that CoinList-issued tokens will
    carry a de facto stamp of approval.¹⁶² Notably, CoinList is also favoring the
