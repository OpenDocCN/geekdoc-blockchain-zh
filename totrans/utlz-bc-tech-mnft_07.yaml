    and from transforming the raw into finished products, it has challenges that are
    needed to be achieved like good quality services to the consumer, reducing labor
    cost, etc. Industries need to digitize real assets and make distributed, immutable
    transactions possible to trace assets from manufacture to supply. To overcome
    the lack of transparency and traceability of the products in the enterprise resource
    planning system in supply chain (SC) and logistics issues, there is a solid need
    to employ a method that can efficiently track assets from production to supply
    decentralized, immutable records of all transactions. A blockchain (BC) is a decentralized
    software network that follows a digital ledger to exchange entities digitally
    and a way through which it makes secure transactions. Thus, this chapter proposes
    integrating BC in logistics and SC monitoring by giving a template on how Python
    and Flask can be used for BC with the SCM system to improve traceability without
    involving any intermediary.

    growth and use of the internet have made business development and processes more
    efficient than ever. Digitalization has helped to solve many business Challenges
    (Tsiulin et al., 2020). Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a system that connects
    the primary roots of the company to its customers to manage the flow of goods
    and services, and it comprises whole operations from transforming the raw into
    finished products. It is the method through which supply chain (SC) operations
    are supervised to benefit rivals and enhance the value of their consumers.

    chain. These challenges occur from phases like Plan, Source, Make, Deliver and
    Return. The Supply Chain Management (SCM) process has already been facing such
    situations, and meanwhile, a new challenge has been introduced in the name of
    Pandemic, i.e., COVID-19\. To protect lives from this Pandemic, the whole countries
    have been locked down completely, and due to this, the supply chain processes
    have been affected badly, the consumers' basic needs could not have been delivered
    timely, and in many countries, people died of hunger. The COVID-19 remains in
    the countries and disturbing the economies around the world. Moreover, despite
    the burden to acquire the economy regain and running, ongoing unpredictability,
    lack of customer belief, and supply chain challenges pursue bear a pressure. Organizations

    and a way through which it makes secure transactions without an arbitrator. Blockchain
    differs from the central database by the way blockchain stores the data (Tijan
    et al., 2019). A blockchain is a fixed time-framed chain record of data dispersed
    and controlled by nodes of the computer network. It is a method to exchange entities

    storing, and exchanging on a blockchain network. Blockchain technology has many
    applications in Healthcare, the Educational sector, voting mechanisms, the automobile
    industry, personal identity security, and Supply chain monitoring (Sharma et al.,
    2021). Different types of data can be stored in a blockchain. The most common
    type is the records of transactions for supply chain monitoring. The blockchain
    will store the product data that will help in tracing the product. As the data
    is immutable and decentralized, it builds trust between different parties. A blockchain
    collects the data in groups known as blocks, and blockchain has a particular space
    to store the data or information; when it is filled, it chains itself with a previous
    block (chain is the hash to the previous block), and when any new data needs to
    be added, it is then added in the new block, every block in the blockchain comprises
    timestamp stating when the block is connected to the chain. It is difficult to
    go back and alter any content once stored in the blockchain, especially those
    already agreed by the majority by general agreement (consensus). As the block
    contains its hash, previous blocks hash, and a timestamp (a mathematical function
    calculates hash), if any participant in the blockchain changes their copy of data,
    then the hash will change, and it will not match with other copies, and thus all
    other participants will know that the data has been modified. Blockchain can be
    applied to many fields which require transparency, security, traceability, etc.

    delivery of products, enhancing products'' traceability, improving coordination
    between partners, and aiding access to financing. Blockchain is a leading-edge
    technology that is being implemented universally nowadays. It enforces application
    in a secure and distributed way and therefore reassures some amount of reliability.
    Due to these reasons, blockchain technology has been adopting in a distrustful
    society. The supply chain connects the primary roots of the company to its customers.
    It involves transforming raw material into a finished good that will serve its
    purpose to the customers. However, this process encounter several difficulties
    that must be resolved using technology as the usage of the technology and internet
    has a great expansion around the world; resolving these difficulties with technology
    will be favorable to customers as it will be simply manageable to customers worldwide.
    Any changes made to the data will be visible to every participant in the blockchain,
    and hence it will improve the visibility. Moreover, Blockchain enhances the ability
    to quickly pinpoint potential sources of contamination to efficiently prevent,
    contain or rectify outbreaks. Blockchain can enable more transparent and accurate
    end-to-end tracking in the supply chain: Organizations can digitize physical assets
    and create a decentralized immutable record of all transactions, making it possible
    to track assets from production to delivery or use by end user. In this way Blockchain
    can improve traceability in supply chain.'

    the challenges tackled by the supply chain industry. It provides all the participants
    within the blockchain visibility to the same. Using a centrally authorized database
    decreases the trust within the parties; participants in a supply chain always
    need to depend on the third party for managing the information stored on the database.
    Using blockchain, some researchers have proposed a model for improving trust,
    visibility, and traceability in business processes. However, some model in the
    literature survey has given only a theoretical explanation and shortfall to explain
    its practical implementations (Jabbar et al., 2021), whereas some models were
    not cost-effective (Mao et al., 2018). Integrating blockchain with the supply
    chain can be a cure (Issaoui et al., 2019). But due to a lack of knowledge of
    people and many other factors, many supply chain organizations are not adopting
    blockchain in this field. The help of a centrally controlled database reduces
    the reliance within the parties; members in a supply chain always need to trust
    the third party to handle the information kept on the database. Some research
    workers proposed prototypes for improving faith, transparency, and traceability
    in commercial practices using blockchain. Many multinational organizations like
    IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft have given good examples for adopting blockchain and
    tracking their products through the supply chain know as BaaS (Blockchain as a
    Service), and soon this technology will proliferate in every field. Integrating
    blockchain with different technology like the IoT will take blockchain technology
    to new heights. Various organizations have started many new initiatives like the
    pilot project, Everledger for integrating the supply chain with blockchain.

    a Logical Model in Python. The objective is to define how blockchain makes better
    traceability and transparency of supply chain and logistics with the help of suggestions
    to implement a method for the creation of blockchain for performing an essential
    function like adding a new block to the chain, performing transactions, implementing
    and validating Proof of Work, methods for using Flask framework for new transactions,
    mining a new block, etc. and suggested a template code for proceeding the above-discussed
    processes for the implementation. Thus, the study will boost the confidence of
    organizations in supply chain management and assist the blockchain developers
    by giving them a template on how we can use Python and Flask for blockchain with
    the Supply Chain Management system in improving traceability without involving
    any intermediary. Finally, this study discusses the challenges- processing speed
    of a transaction gets degrade due to decentralized control when Blockchain with
    Supply chain integrate when compared to centralized control, incompatible issue
    due to different blockchain platforms have different protocols, blockchain with
    less number of nodes has a higher risk of attacks into the network, and this gap
    motivates the research workers to make this proposed prototype model, a safe and
    secured one. It is expected that a proper solution will be set up to resolve the
    technical shortcomings that are pointed out in the chapter, and proper practical
    implementation will be introduced, and as future direction this leaves a broader
    scope in the integration of Blockchain with Logistics and Supply Chain Monitoring

- en: Blockchain can be defined as a distributed and decentralized database that can
    store transaction records and ensures transparency, traceability, security, and
    immutability. It is also called a chain of blocks storing transactional data not
    controlled by any single authority. The transactional records stored in a blockchain
    are timestamped, which means that the time at which any transaction was added
    to a block will also be a part of that block (Chang & Chen, 2020). Blockchain
    is a system of multiple computers or peers connected in a network that performs
    as a decentralized network over the internet (Abeyratne & Monfared, 2016). Every
    node in the blockchain network has the power to create a transaction, validate
    a transaction, accept a transaction, and make a block. Blockchain is a sequence
    of blocks (set of records) linked with each other cryptographically. Due to immutability
    in blockchain, when we insert a transactions set in a blockchain, inserted blocks
    become blockchain network part, and then no one can contradict it or modify it.
    Every node in a network of blockchain has an individual reproduction of the database
    that stores the transactions. Anyone in the blockchain network, an authorized
    participant can check or use the transaction history from the database whenever
    they want and receive revised data each time a node attaches any fresh transactions
    (block) into the chain. The private, consortium, or hybrid blockchain can be used
    by an organization that does not want to share every little detail with others.
    In these types of blockchain, an organization can control and restrict who can
    be a part of that blockchain. However, private blockchains are less secure, and
    trust-building is a little complicated than public blockchain. However, it is
    entirely dependent on the organization's type of blockchain network (public, private)
    they want to work on. While comparing blockchain with a traditional centralized
    solution provides immutability, transparency, traceability, trust, and more security.
    Figure 1 has demonstrated the utilization of Blockchain technology in the SC and
    Logistics, manufacturers, retailers, growers, healthcare, secure voting, financial,
    educational, and many more sectors.

    to manufacture and deliver the finished product or goods to the customer. Supply
    chain management represents that how the final product reaches the buyer safely
    and serves its purpose. Logistics is the subsection of the supply chain as logistics
    move goods from place to place (Dobrovnik et al., 2018), so tracking the products
    is essential whether the final good reaches the customer. Quality Function Deployment
    (QFD) methodology is the most reliable and proved method to identify customer-based
    strategy. QFD can help determine critical customer requirements and prioritize
    them to determine the critical supply chain factors to improve supply chain performances.
    The use of QFD has been reported by many in varied sectors. The usefulness of
    QFD especially in forecasting and website design was discussed by (Sharma and
    Khandait, 2016), (Purohit and Sharma, 2015), (Sharma and Khandait, 2017), (Sharma
    et. al., 2009). However, supply chain and logistics are facing difficulties and
    challenges concerning the security, visibility, transparency of various operations,
    transactional issues, manual errors, delay in processing, updating, or sharing
    data and information, speed in delivering goods and services, difficulties in
    tracking and tracing the origin of their goods and services. One of the technologies
    that can overcome these shortcomings can be the application of blockchain in SCM.

    of the product from A to Z. Blockchain can leverage traceability for improving
    operational efficiency through mapping and visualization of enterprise supply
    chains. The continuously increasing demand for sourcing information about products
    is also a notable factor for emphasizing the need for blockchain traceability.

    It offers a technique to store transactions in a rapid, inexpensive, and straightforward
    means, which may be employed in applications as a safe payment system within the
    IoT area; autonomous devices will use Bitcoins to make micro-payments, operating
    in the main as wallets (Villegas-Ch, 2020). However, once the utilization of blockchain
    is restricted to micro-payments, applications are connected to the currency, which
    may be a disadvantage because it is expressed using smart contracts is a standard

    python and flask to create a blockchain that can be improved in the future and
    provide more blockchain technology features. The application of blockchain has
    several technical limitations addressed in the paper that include storage capacity,
    scalability, interoperability, and security (51% attack), which are expected to
    be improved when applied in the field of SCM. The implementation of blockchain
    in supply chain and logistics is average due to the presence of technical issues
    and some organizational issues (lack of awareness and understanding, less cooperation,
    etc.); nevertheless, it will soon gain the confidence of the majority of organizations
    in supply chain management. As for future result opportunities, it is expected
    that a proper solution will be set up to resolve the technical shortcomings that
    are pointed out in the chapter, and proper practical implementation will be introduced.
