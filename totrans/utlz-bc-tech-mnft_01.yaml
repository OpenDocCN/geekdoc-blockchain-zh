- en: We wish to acknowledge the help of all the people involved in completing the
    book and, more specifically, the authors (contributors) and reviewers who contributed
    active role in the contributing chapter and in review process respectively. Without
    their support, this book would not have become a reality. We thank God for the
    opportunity to pursue this highly relevant subject at this time, and each of the
    authors for their collective contributions. My sincere gratitude goes to all the
    chapter authors who contributed their time and expertise to this book. We wish
    to acknowledge the valuable contributions of all the peer reviewers regarding
    their suggestions for improvement of quality, coherence, and content for chapters.
    Some authors served as referees; we highly appreciate their time and commitment.
    A successful book publication is the integrated result of more people than those
    persons granted credit as editor and author.
