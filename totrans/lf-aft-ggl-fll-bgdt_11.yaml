    the dominant payment system in use throughout the world. Then the total value
    of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world.
    Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range
    from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin
    a value of about $10 million.

    may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million to 1! Even

    and around the world—have been sucked up into the phantasmagorical pages of a
    novel by Neal Stephenson, the shy West Coast prodigy who is the twenty-first century’s
    greatest writer and demiurge? You can say it is my wild opinion. You can call
    it metafact or mystifiction, a demented conspiracy theory, or even a massively
    multiplayer online game, or a virtual world. But you cannot prove that it isn’t
    true—that the ardent logorrheic genius cyberludic scrivener with the ponytail
    and the kaleidoscopic brain and fiber-optic diet has not somehow infiltrated the
    very operating code of the system of the world. Kindled out of the headquarters
    of a giant corporation near his home in Seattle—call it Amazon—perhaps using its
    3D streaming capabilities from OTOY’s Octane graphics rendering engine—Stephenson
    has phished all our identities and occupied our screens. He has gotten us all
    unconsciously to live his novel.

    online game (MMOG) called “T’Rain” has captivated the world’s digerati. It is
    virtual—a computerized 3D “second life”—but it has a crucial dimension that allows
    it to overflow into what we quaintly term “real life.” It has a currency—a monetary
    system—and it is based on a gold standard. It is a fake gold standard, but the
    emulation is accurate enough to create a gilded simulacrum of monetary value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Stephenson’s account, T’Rain employs a sophisticated geologist to reproduce
    algorithmically not only the topography of Google Earth but also the underlying
    strata of its actual geology. To acquire purchasing media for the game you have
    to “mine” simulated gold from the stratigraphic mazes of the algorithmic sub-terrain.
    In theory, this is as relatively costly, time-consuming, and difficult in the
    geologist’s virtual reality as mining real gold is from the earth.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To win the mining race in T’Rain, players around the world rev up their computers,
    overclocking their microprocessors, jacking up voltages, and chilling the circuitry
    with water or liquid nitrogen. To extract the gold and bring it intact to virtual
    market, they angle for underground mineral rights, purchase seismic surveying
    systems, dredging gear, hydraulic equipment, and transport facilities, and hire
    armed guards or even mobilize small armies. Millions of Chinese hackers take the
    lead, obsessively deploying petaflops—thousands of trillions of floating-point
    operations per second—to simulate the extraction process.

- en: Like gold standards through most of human history—look it up—T’Rain’s virtual
    gold standard is an engine of wealth. T’Rain prospers mightily. Even though its
    money is metafictional, it is in fact more stable than currencies in the real
    world of floating exchange rates and fiat money. Down here, for example, the U.S.
    government deploys its own computer power to fabricate dollars by the trillions
    out of thin air to pay its bills. Goldman Sachs deploys rackfuls of computer power
    linked by fiber-optic lines at the speed of light to extract lucrative margins
    out of prestidigitory trading in nanoseconds with nary a reference to real values.
    In T’Rain it is much harder and thus more realistic.

- en: Moreover—and this is the rub—the virtual money cannot be confined to T’Rain.
    It gets out. By various devious and ingenious techniques, T’Rain gold miners convert
    their stash by the millions for use in the real world. Centered in China, where
    exporting renminbi is heavily restricted, there are a number of possibly sinister
    but nonetheless effective “exchanges” and brokers and conversion facilities that
    translate virtual wealth into terrestrial wealth.

    galore and produce billions of dollars of capital gains for its shareholders,
    but “miners” manage to translate their virtual gold into millions of real dollars
    and yuan on earth. They can even use it to buy gold bullion. Reamde’s plot revolves
    around these phase transitions between the virtual and real worlds.

    Gold and commodity markets gyrate portentously. Central Bankers meet solemnly
    to decide on levels of “quantitative easing”—on how many trillions of dollars
    of bonds to buy or sell, thus issuing new money into a flagging economy or sopping
    up money from a booming one. They hope against hope that these metafictional money
    fabrications can somehow overflow into the real world of economics and job creation.
    Lots of luck with that. Perhaps they should consult a novelist.

    financial system. This is not fiction, although Stephenson’s fingerprints are
    all over the story, which uncannily resembles the made-up world of Reamde. According
    to some of bitcoin’s protagonists, such as the legendary Hal Finney, the first
    user of the program, it emulates “Galt Gulch” in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged.[⁴](notes.html#ch11note-4)

    John Galt. But there are many intriguing speculations, and I have my own unoriginal
    ideas. He may be a team that began small and has now mounted into millions. For
