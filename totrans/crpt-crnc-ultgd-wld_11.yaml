- en: From the first introduction of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency has been going through
    a major evolution with an endless stream of improvements with each new emerging
    currency. Smart contracts are just one of those evolutionary changes in a digital
    currency that has lots of advantages.

    stored on a blockchain" or "any computation that takes place on a blockchain."
    Many debates about the nature of smart contracts are really just contests between
    competing terminologies. The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare
    the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a
    notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you
    simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e., ledger), and your escrow,
    driver's license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts
    not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that
    a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.

    versions of real contracts. With a standard contract between two parties, you
    have an agreement that stipulates what each party must do for the transaction
    to be completed. The contract actually sets the parameters of who does what, when
    to do it, how to do it, and what happens once it’s been done.

    form subjected to territorial laws and regulations of the land where they were
    drawn up. Also, with these contracts, the terms of the contract could always subject
    to interpretation.

- en: Today’s Smart Contracts improve on all of that. Firstly, these digital agreements
    are designed to be self-executing and enforced without any additional party to
    weigh in on the matter. There is no need to have the language of the agreement
    interpreted in any way.

    computer code and programming languages that stipulate the terms and expectations
    of the agreement.

    recognize. These contracts do not need a company or regulations to enforce them.
    This means that there is no longer a bureaucracy or any associated costs for such
    services. They can actually be something like a do-it-yourself contract allowing
    them to self-manage based on the terms agreed upon by only the parties involved.
    Basically, you could look at them as programmable money, allowing users to solve
    common problems themselves.

    Ethereum, and Lisk. However, this is only the beginning. Smart contracts are so
    efficient and practical that more currencies will be adopting them as the world
    of cryptocurrency continues to grow and expand.

    but nonetheless, smart contracts would allay all concerns by providing an infinitely
    more secure system. Ledger-protected votes would need to be decoded and require
    excessive computing power to access. No one has that much computing power, so
    it would need God to hack the system! Secondly, smart contracts could hike low
    voter turnout. Much of the inertia comes from a fumbling system that includes
    lining up, showing your identity, and completing forms. With smart contracts,
    volunteers can transfer voting online, and millennials will turn out en masse
    to vote for their Potus.

- en: The blockchain not only provides a single ledger as a source of trust, but also
    shaves possible snarls in communication and workflow because of its accuracy,
    transparency, and automated system. Ordinarily, business operations have to endure
    a back-and-forth, while waiting for approvals and for internal or external issues
    to sort themselves out. A blockchain ledger streamlines this. It also cuts out
    discrepancies that typically occur with independent processing, and that may lead
    to costly lawsuits and settlement delays.

    to super-smart robots. Think of a future where everything is automated. Google's
    getting there with smartphones, smart glasses, and even smart cars. That's where
    smart contracts help. One example is the self-autonomous or self-parking vehicles,
    where smart contracts could put into play a sort of ‘oracle' that could detect
    who was at fault in a crash; the sensor or the driver, as well as countless other
    variables. Using smart contracts, an automobile insurance company could charge
    rates differently based on where, and under which, conditions customers are operating
    their vehicles.
