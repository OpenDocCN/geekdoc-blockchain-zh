    exchanged a specially designed file with another developer. The thirty thousand
    lines of code were a form of digital currency that Nakamoto had proposed several
    months earlier in a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”'

    Through most of 2009, no one would value a single Bitcoin at more than just a
    few pennies. In 2010 a programmer completed the first known commercial Bitcoin
    transaction: the delivery of two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins. Seven years later,
    the Bitcoin used to buy those two pizzas was worth more than $100 million. The
    day that the transaction occurred—May 22—would be celebrated by cryptocurrency
    enthusiasts as a holiday: Bitcoin Pizza Day.'

- en: The journey of Bitcoin, from an obscure program to the height of global finance,
    is an extraordinary and controversial story. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency.
    A cryptocurrency, in simple terms, is a digital asset that relies on the internet
    and computers to verify its value and ownership. It is designed to be used like
    money. According to supporters, cryptocurrencies represent a new way of storing
    value and conducting business, one that exploits the ease and reach of technology.
    In this vision, cryptocurrencies will replace paper and coin currencies. Costly,
    slow intermediaries will be removed from the transaction process. Tyrannical governments
    and corrupt institutions will be sidelined. Individuals will freely conduct transactions
    directly with one another in a framework that establishes and maintains trust.

- en: Although Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, some physical coins have been
    produced as collectors’ items. The physical coin can come preloaded with the code
    for a digital Bitcoin or can come blank so that buyers can upload their own Bitcoin
    to it.

    Blockchain is a decentralized computer system that can guarantee the authenticity
    of data. In effect, blockchain establishes the truth. Blockchain can validate
    transactions between organizations or people—from concert tickets, to supply chains,
    to legal documents such as property deeds, stock certificates, or identification
    cards.'

- en: These extraordinary claims have drawn skepticism from economists, technology
    experts, and financial regulators. They deride cryptocurrencies as at best a fad
    and at worst a fraud. In their view, Bitcoin and its herd of copycats are driven
    by speculators hoping to bid up prices before dumping them, leaving investors
    with losses. Blockchain ignores the value and stability that intermediaries bring
    to society and requires a deep understanding of computer code. It assumes technology
    can solve human nature.

- en: Who is right? We’ll find out, because if there’s anything certain about Bitcoin,
    cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, it’s that they are not going away anytime soon.
    Rather, they are at the center of debates about the role of technology in human
    society. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain can play a critical role in the future—for
    better or for worse.
