- en: 'In January 2009, a mysterious software developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto
    exchanged a specially designed file with another developer. The thirty thousand
    lines of code were a form of digital currency that Nakamoto had proposed several
    months earlier in a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”'

  zh: 2009年1月，一个名为中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）的神秘软件开发者在另一位开发者那里交换了一个特别设计的文件。这三万行代码是一种数字货币，中本聪在前几个月的一篇名为“比特币：一种点对点的电子现金系统”的论文中提出了这种货币。
- en: 'This was the first Bitcoin transaction, but few people noticed it at the time.
    Through most of 2009, no one would value a single Bitcoin at more than just a
    few pennies. In 2010 a programmer completed the first known commercial Bitcoin
    transaction: the delivery of two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins. Seven years later,
    the Bitcoin used to buy those two pizzas was worth more than $100 million. The
    day that the transaction occurred—May 22—would be celebrated by cryptocurrency
    enthusiasts as a holiday: Bitcoin Pizza Day.'

  zh: 这是第一笔比特币交易，但当时很少有人注意到它。在2009年的大部分时间里，没有人会为一个比特币的价值超过仅仅几美分。2010年，一名程序员完成了第一笔被知的商业比特币交易：用10,000比特币换取两份披萨。七年后的今天，用来买这两份披萨的比特币价值超过了1亿美元。交易发生的当天——5月22日——将被加密货币爱好者庆祝为节日：比特币披萨节。
- en: The journey of Bitcoin, from an obscure program to the height of global finance,
    is an extraordinary and controversial story. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency.
    A cryptocurrency, in simple terms, is a digital asset that relies on the internet
    and computers to verify its value and ownership. It is designed to be used like
    money. According to supporters, cryptocurrencies represent a new way of storing
    value and conducting business, one that exploits the ease and reach of technology.
    In this vision, cryptocurrencies will replace paper and coin currencies. Costly,
    slow intermediaries will be removed from the transaction process. Tyrannical governments
    and corrupt institutions will be sidelined. Individuals will freely conduct transactions
    directly with one another in a framework that establishes and maintains trust.

  zh: 比特币从一款鲜为人知的程序发展成为全球金融的巅峰，这是一个非同寻常且颇具争议的故事。比特币是最著名的加密货币。简单来说，加密货币是一种依赖互联网和计算机来验证其价值和所有权的数字资产。它被设计成像货币一样使用。根据支持者的说法，加密货币代表了一种新的存储价值和进行业务的方式，这种方式利用了技术的便捷和普及。在这个愿景中，加密货币将取代纸币和硬币货币。昂贵、缓慢的中介将被从交易过程中移除。专制的政府和腐败的机构将被边缘化。个人将在一个建立和维护信任的框架内，自由地与其他个人直接进行交易。

- en: Although Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, some physical coins have been
    produced as collectors’ items. The physical coin can come preloaded with the code
    for a digital Bitcoin or can come blank so that buyers can upload their own Bitcoin
    to it.

  zh: 尽管比特币是一种数字货币，但已经有一些实体硬币作为收藏品被生产出来。这些实体硬币可以预先加载一个数字比特币的代码，也可以是空白的，这样购买者就可以将其自己的比特币上传到硬币上。
- en: 'At the heart of these claims lies the infrastructure beneath Bitcoin: blockchain.
    Blockchain is a decentralized computer system that can guarantee the authenticity
    of data. In effect, blockchain establishes the truth. Blockchain can validate
    transactions between organizations or people—from concert tickets, to supply chains,
    to legal documents such as property deeds, stock certificates, or identification
    cards.'

  zh: 这些主张的核心在于比特币之下的基础设施：区块链。区块链是一个去中心化的计算机系统，能够保证数据的 authenticity。实际上，区块链确立了真相。区块链可以验证组织或个人之间的交易——从音乐会门票，到供应链，到房产证、股票证书或身份证等法律文件。
- en: These extraordinary claims have drawn skepticism from economists, technology
    experts, and financial regulators. They deride cryptocurrencies as at best a fad
    and at worst a fraud. In their view, Bitcoin and its herd of copycats are driven
    by speculators hoping to bid up prices before dumping them, leaving investors
    with losses. Blockchain ignores the value and stability that intermediaries bring
    to society and requires a deep understanding of computer code. It assumes technology
    can solve human nature.

  zh: 这些非凡的主张遭到了经济学家、技术专家和金融监管者的质疑。他们将加密货币视为最多是一种时尚，最少是一种欺诈。在他们看来，比特币及其众多山寨币是由希望在大涨之前买入然后抛售，从而让投资者遭受损失的投机者所驱动的。区块链忽略了中介为社会带来的价值和稳定性，并需要深入了解计算机代码。它假设技术可以解决人性问题。
- en: Who is right? We’ll find out, because if there’s anything certain about Bitcoin,
    cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, it’s that they are not going away anytime soon.
    Rather, they are at the center of debates about the role of technology in human
    society. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain can play a critical role in the future—for
    better or for worse.

  zh: 谁是对的？我们会找到答案，因为关于比特币、加密货币和区块链，有一件事是确定的，那就是它们不会很快消失。相反，它们正处在关于技术在人类社会中角色的大讨论中心。加密货币和区块链在未来可能发挥关键作用——无论好坏。
