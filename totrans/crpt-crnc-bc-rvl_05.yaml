    has been stolen. This number could be even larger, as some thefts go unreported.
    Since 2017 alone, crypto thieves have made off with nearly $2 billion. These attacks
    have become increasingly sophisticated and organized. They take advantage of popular
    misperceptions of what makes a blockchain secure and supposedly unhackable. Like
    every security system invented, blockchain has both strengths and weaknesses.

    the exchanges on which they are stored. Exchanges are like a combination of banks
    and marketplaces: they connect buyers and sellers and hold assets—in this case,
    cryptocurrencies—in accounts. These accounts differ from the private keys associated
    with blockchain because they are connected to individuals. As a result, cryptocurrency
    exchanges contain sensitive information about account holders and, most importantly,

    revel in his wealth. He donated 5,000 Bitcoins to the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization

    2014, the exchange collapsed into bankruptcy. More than $400 million vanished.

    with its own currency to fund a number of start-up projects?

    because it was still barely established. And so they proposed a hard fork. The
    hard fork makes changes that retroactively apply across the blockchain. In effect,
    the past can literally be rewritten. In block 1,920,000, the programmers wrote

    everyone on the supply chain to enter data. A decade later, Walmart tried again,
    this time using blockchain. To Stinchcombe, the very framing of the problem and
    solution was absurd. If mango pickers did not like to enter produce information
