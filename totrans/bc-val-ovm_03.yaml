  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To recap, a token represents a tradable asset or utility often found on a blockchain.
    Each token has specific properties that are defined to match its usage. They are
    both generic and fungible. In plain English, this means that a token can stand
    in for any form of value, and it is exchangeable between different specific types
    of value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A token differs from our traditional monetary currency in that it is more generic.
    Whereas “money” represents specifically economic capital, tokens can define a
    broader set of values, including social capital, natural capital, or cultural
    capital. Simply put, “fungibility” is the essential feature of any currency, as
    a means of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. (And let’s be honest,
    it’s a great word no matter what it means).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A fungible good is defined by its type—by what it can be exchanged for. Each
    unit of fungible goods is not inherently unique, and as such is perfectly interchangeable.
    One $5 bill can be exchanged with another because they all hold the same value
    and are, for all intents and purposes, identical. A book that you pay $5 for cannot
    necessarily be exchanged for a shirt you pay $5 for; they are not fungible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Brace yourselves—there’s more tech jargon coming. Now that we know our fungibles,
    let’s up the ante and bring in “fungible ERC-20” tokens. ERC-20 is a technical
    standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing
    tokens. For our purposes, if you include certain functions in the token’s smart
    contract, you are ERC-20 compliant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fungible ERC-20 tokens are interchangeable. A fungible token can be exchanged
    for any other token with the same value (like our $5 bill example). They are also
    uniform—each fungible token is identical to another token of the same kind. Like
    the dollar that can be divided into many cents, fungible tokens are divisible
    into smaller amounts, and you can send a friend a fraction of a token.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other goods are nonfungibles. Whereas they may share common attributes, nonfungible
    products have unique traits and unique values assigned to those traits. Pokémon
    cards are a great example of nonfungible goods because whereas each one is unique,
    they all follow the same typology. Whereas one person may decide that one card
    is worth trading for another, that’s *their* decision and *their* value judgment;
    the two cards are not inherently equal in value in the same way that two $5 bills
    are.

    standard used for exchangeable, NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-721 standard
    is used to tie unique properties, and even real-world assets, to crypto assets.
    It sets forth a standard set of attributes and functions in the form of a smart
    contract that must be met to be managed, owned, and traded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The classic technical standard ERC-20 is used for smart contracts on the Ethereum
    blockchain for implementing tokens. It covers only a few asset attributes, such
    as name, symbol, total supply, and balance. ERC-721, on the other hand, allows
    for more specific qualities. Applying this standard, you can now include rich
    metadata about an asset as well as information such as ownership. These additional
    details can ultimately add a lot of value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nonfungible ERC-720 tokens (NFTs) are noninterchangeable and cannot be replaced
    with other tokens of the same type. If you lend the token to someone, you expect
    them to return the same token. For instance, if a museum lends a Leonardo DaVinci
    painting to another museum for an exhibition, it wouldn’t be too impressed if
    it received a Leonardo DiCaprio back. NFTs are unique, with individual attributes
    that make them irreplaceable or impossible to swap. Think of them as like concert
    tickets—while each ticket is to the same concert, each one has a different seat
    number. Furthermore, unlike our dollar, NFTs cannot be divided. In much the same
    way that your college degree cannot be shared or swapped with someone else’s (which
    is a shame—how many of us really know what they want to do for the rest of our
    lives at that age … or, in my case, at any age?).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ERC-721 standards document an asset’s ownership, approval, transfer, and
    other metadata. It enables you to record all your asset’s valuable and conclusive
    information. For example, if you are a collector, you may value the ownership
    credentials of a collectible, provenance, and transaction history. Such additional
    information about your digital property may make it more valuable.

    unlike any other token that’s out there in circulation. If you have ever watched
    an 8-year-old play, fortunately, you will know just how much cache “RARE!” carries,
    and that’s before we’re even out of short trousers.

- en: Fungible tokens may be limited in capturing and representing the value of goods
    that are indivisible and irreplaceable, such as a commodity, a contract, or a
    qualification. Conversely, NFTs can be used to represent unique goods such as
    a ticket, a bottle of wine, a piece of jewelry, and others. Tokenizing these unique
    objects of value allows you to trace the ownership, and in the process, you build
    a connection between information about the object and the value of the object.
    NFTs enable recording of the ownership of indivisible and unique assets, and an
    ownership record on blockchain makes the record transparent and tamper-resistant.

    unique tokens on Ethereum. For example, as we have seen, CryptoKitties allows
    you to buy, breed, and trade digital cats. It’s no surprise that other animals
    have sought to get a piece of the NFT action. PlasmaBears[8](12_ch03.xhtml#ch03en8)
    enables you to build, sell, and trade—wait for it—digital bears. You can send
    them on adventures to discover valuable, wearable, and tradable assets. Etheremon
    enables you to strike out and capture, train, sell, and trade unique digital creatures
    known as Mons.[9](12_ch03.xhtml#ch03en9)

    by the basic tenets of collecting and trading, but with the bonus of fighting.
    In Chibi Fighters, you can collect, trade, and digitally battle warriors on the
    battlefield, while weapons that kill and destroy in a multitude of deeply satisfying
    ways are some of the in-game assets that you can collect and trade. In HyperDragons,
    you can collect, breed, train, trade, and battle unique digital tortoises (ok,
    it’s dragons) on the blockchain. Meanwhile, in Axie Infinity, you can collect,
    raise, and battle unique digital fantasy creatures.[10](12_ch03.xhtml#ch03en10)

    still mostly collecting and trading games, they have included a little extra complexity
    for the more discerning gamer that seeks a more intellectual challenge. For example,
    in Decentraland, you can claim your NFT-based plot of land in this virtual reality
    world and prepare to build and trade assets. In CryptoBaseball, you can collect
    tokens that represent real baseball players, and develop your team to reflect
    real-world performance. Back to fighting in CryptoAssault, you can command armies
    in a 3D world, capture territory, mine resources, and battle opponents.[11](12_ch03.xhtml#ch03en11)

    who knows the industry inside and out. Luna Javier is creative director at Altitude
    Games,[12](12_ch03.xhtml#ch03en12) a mobile and blockchain games studio in Southeast
    Asia. Altitude is developing Battle Racers, an arcade racing game on the blockchain.
    She breaks down the intimidation factor of using blockchain in gaming. “Blockchain
    is intimidating. There are all these buzzwords. It’s easier if you think of the
    blockchain as a gaming platform, as just a new technology that you can use to
    build games on.”

    There are three that she identifies as especially critical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '1. Decentralization: “In traditional video games like World of Warcraft, you
    can play for a long time and have a super-maxed out character with all maxed out
    gear. You probably worked very hard and invested time and money into developing
    this character. But the data is all centralized; it’s stored on their servers.
    If anything happens to those servers, whether accidental or the company decides
    to delete your account, then you lose a year of your hard work. That’s just how
    it is. Now, imagine if you have a character where data doesn’t live in one place.
    With blockchain game design, if you are building on Ethereum, you have decentralization.
    Some amazing functionalities and features also become possible.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '2. True ownership: Javier goes on to explain that blockchain allows for very
    real ownership. “Still using the World of Warcraft example, you as a player don’t
    own your character or gear. You are just borrowing them for some time. If the
    game company shuts down, your items are gone. If the item lives on the blockchain,
    then we have ‘true item ownership.’ I own this the same way I own a physical Magic:
    The Gathering card. If I bought a Magic deck of cards, even if Wizards of the
    Coast were to shut down, I still own the cards. I can do whatever I want with
    them because I bought them and I hold them. We have never been able to do that
    with digital assets before the blockchain.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'She emphasizes that true ownership allows you to bring your characters and
    assets to another game: “Because you own this character, you can decide to play
    another game with it. So if I own my World of Warcraft character, I could bring
    it into another game.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A blockchain item can be used across different properties, and we call that
    ‘interoperability.’ This is what the developers are excited about; we can collaborate
    and support one another. This was also not possible before. In the past, companies
    would never share items across games. They wouldn’t even share items across their
    own games! Now, these blockchain items and characters are independent of the companies
    where they originated. And they have real-world value! I could sell my digital
    item to somebody else the same way I could sell a Magic card to somebody else.
    And Wizards of the Coast has no control over that.”
  prefs: []

- en: '3. Gamers as investors: “This brings us to another valuable characteristic.
    We are used to buying a console game and paying $60 upfront. Or in mobile games,
    you don’t pay anything upfront, but you can keep paying for in-app purchases.
    On average, players pay about a $100 for a console game and about $90 for a mobile
    game. With blockchain users, based on a September 2018 report, it was about $200
    per blockchain gaming user—approximately twice as much. People are spending a
    lot of money.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Blockchain gamers are more like investors. They want to buy these items and
    make their money back. That’s a different mindset to understand and cater for.
    A blockchain game developer has to design a game where your players earned their
    investment back. These three characteristics of blockchain we didn’t have before
    on any other platform.”

    an arcade, you’re standing around with other players doing real-time racing. And
    we’ve added some extra ingredients, such as weapons. It’s turning out to be more

    way, and a really good game will use it to its advantage. In our case, the cars
    and car parts are ERC721 tokens. You can swap various parts around and mix and
    match to make a wacky car. And every part has different game stats—speed, etc.
    You can play in the arena for free without a car or play with a car you made but
    not tokenize it. Or you can tokenize them to become race cars.

    real rewards. Your race car also starts to record history because it’s a token.
    It is recording how many wins you have, who owns this car, and other information.
    You can imagine a car that’s been around for 3 months and passed around from owner
    to owner. This car is getting older because you can’t change the parts of the
    car and new parts are coming up all the time. It becomes vintage, famous, just
    like a car in the real world. And as you win with the car, you earn exclusive
    bonus stats that you can’t get anywhere else. It becomes stronger, faster. The
    car becomes a legend and accumulates value.

    It becomes more than just a beautiful object—it now has another dimension of history,
    use, and users. It improves with age because it has experience. It becomes valuable
    because you can play the game on a different level and in a different way. If
    a tokenized car represents the major league, then a nontokenized car is kind of
    like a junior league.

    are still around today are platforms. It’s the Yahoos, the Amazons, Googles, etc.
    We’re going to see this kind of trend continues, but I also feel that the individual
    is going to become more empowered. One of the things I’m most excited about is
    sovereignty over our data. The blockchain enables new possibilities such as decentralized
    aspects and new data models. Sovereignty for data models is becoming important.
    And for it to be sovereign, you have to be able to take your data away and take
    it where you want to take it.[14](12_ch03.xhtml#ch03en14)

    look at an athlete to a fan connection. Currently, you do that through a platform
    such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc., but the athlete doesn’t own that connection.
    The ownership is with a third party or a platform. It is a little bit like the
    phone company owns your relationship with your neighbor. There are clear implications
    for this. If Instagram deletes your account, then those connections would be gone.

    avid fan versus a general fan. When you think about an event at a stadium, how
    do you know who’s in the crowd? How do you know if somebody is coming here because
    a friend invited them, or whether this is somebody who comes to at least three
    or four home games each season?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider a band playing their first concert, and each person that is at that
    first concert receives a badge. Now, let’s say the band makes it big—imagine if
    they could identify the fans that have been following them from day one. We have
    new possibilities of creating something like that, allowing bands to determine
    who their avid fans are, who goes to their shows every time they’re in town, who
    listens to their music and buys their albums and their merchandise and engages
    with the band on social media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Julia observes,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We see the first step in establishing these connections as enabling a band—or
    an athlete or a celebrity—to give some credentials for their social channels.
    That would start to identify who engages with their content the most, whether
    through liking, commenting, sharing things, reposting, etc. to create lists of
    what we could identify as “avid fans.” Then there are some further clarifications
    where you want to identify not just obsessive fans, but ordinary fans who know
    and are into the band. If somebody leaves a comment on a thread on a social channel
    and other people like it, that’s a signifier that it created or added some value
    to the conversation, as opposed to somebody just regularly posting stuff that
    doesn’t matter. We are working through some of those things to bring that to the
    surface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just as we have different relationships with different people in the real world,
    close family, extended family, close friends, acquaintances, neighbors, celebrities
    can have different virtual relationships with different fans. Julia explains,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That connection can be retargeted, communicated, and rewarded appropriately.
    So a band may want to do a free concert for all their avid fans because they’re
    always buying their stuff and coming to the shows. It’s tough to gain any visibility
    around that.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    management. Julia explains,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NFTs have the rights management integrated within. If you tokenize yourself
    as a celebrity or an athlete you can create a parent and child relationship that
    allows you to do fun things like allow for somebody to play you in a game, as
    an avatar. Because you own that, now suddenly you can play that avatar inside
    of a game.
  prefs: []

    or the person’s likeness and the licensing of the team logos and league rights
    all combined and integrated to optimize the fan experience. If you could streamline

    to go through the process to acquire rights.

    create these connections with their fans that they own. In the first stage, we
    would start to aggregate through social channels to identify a category of fandom.
    We need to be creating these sovereign connections that don’t have to be through

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this avatar further, you may have to go to a show or attend a game. Let’s say
    you go to a game and you have a token of a player that beats a personal record
    or a league record, something like that. As those milestones are achieved, the
    avatar is changing. When the game is done maybe he has different shoes, jersey,
    skills, or scars. The avatar could have a new jersey, and you could take that
    and put it into a game environment and can play him. What if the gameplay is affected
    and it is different based on your activities? It creates a bridge between driving
    foot traffic and driving people to complete some kinds of tasks by having an impact
    on gameplay and creating a more virtual kind of environment.

    the ownership of an underlying asset. For example, electronic records that are
    the equivalents of negotiable instruments and electronic chattel paper would be
    digital assets, as would an electronic recording of a security interest in the
    underlying asset. It is similar to recording title to real or personal property
    and the use of tokens to represent revenue streams from otherwise illiquid assets
    such as patents and commercial real estate (sometimes referred to as a “tokenized”
    or digitized asset).

    an eye on different types of digital possessions and how these assets are optimized,
    used, and monitored. Whether it’s to ensure security against hacks or integrity
    to maintain value, all sorts of industries have a vested interest in improving
    the efficacy of how they own, store, and trade assets. As we have seen with the
    widespread adoption and growth of NFTs, blockchain technology is being developed
    and utilized as solutions to problems that we didn’t even realize we had. As our
    digital assets continue to develop and become more complex, expect nonfungible
    blockchain technology to follow closely behind, adapting and constantly reproving
    its value as a source of innovation and creative solutions.
