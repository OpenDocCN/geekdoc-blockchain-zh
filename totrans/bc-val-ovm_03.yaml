- en: To recap, a token represents a tradable asset or utility often found on a blockchain.
    Each token has specific properties that are defined to match its usage. They are
    both generic and fungible. In plain English, this means that a token can stand
    in for any form of value, and it is exchangeable between different specific types
    of value.

  zh: 回顾一下，代币代表了一种可交易资产或实用性，通常在区块链上找到。每个代币都有特定的属性，这些属性被定义以匹配其使用。它们既是通用的又是可替代的。用简单的话来说，这意味着一个代币可以代表任何形式的价值，并且可以在不同具体类型的价值之间进行交换。
- en: A token differs from our traditional monetary currency in that it is more generic.
    Whereas “money” represents specifically economic capital, tokens can define a
    broader set of values, including social capital, natural capital, or cultural
    capital. Simply put, “fungibility” is the essential feature of any currency, as
    a means of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. (And let’s be honest,
    it’s a great word no matter what it means).

  zh: 代币与我们传统的货币货币的区别在于它更加通用。尽管“货币”代表具体的经济资本，但代币可以定义更广泛的价值集合，包括社会资本、自然资本或文化资本。简单地说，“可替代性”是任何货币作为交换手段、计价单位和价值储存的基本特征。（而且说实话，无论它意味着什么，都是一个很好的词）。
- en: A fungible good is defined by its type—by what it can be exchanged for. Each
    unit of fungible goods is not inherently unique, and as such is perfectly interchangeable.
    One $5 bill can be exchanged with another because they all hold the same value
    and are, for all intents and purposes, identical. A book that you pay $5 for cannot
    necessarily be exchanged for a shirt you pay $5 for; they are not fungible.

  zh: 一个可替代商品是由其类型定义的——由它可以被交换的东西。每个可替代商品的单位本质上不是独特的，因此是完全可替代的。一张5美元的钞票可以与其他任何一张交换，因为它们都持有相同的价值，并且在所有意图和目的上都是相同的。你花5美元买的书不一定可以交换你花5美元买的衬衫；它们不是可替代的。
- en: Brace yourselves—there’s more tech jargon coming. Now that we know our fungibles,
    let’s up the ante and bring in “fungible ERC-20” tokens. ERC-20 is a technical
    standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing
    tokens. For our purposes, if you include certain functions in the token’s smart
    contract, you are ERC-20 compliant.

- en: Fungible ERC-20 tokens are interchangeable. A fungible token can be exchanged
    for any other token with the same value (like our $5 bill example). They are also
    uniform—each fungible token is identical to another token of the same kind. Like
    the dollar that can be divided into many cents, fungible tokens are divisible
    into smaller amounts, and you can send a friend a fraction of a token.

- en: Other goods are nonfungibles. Whereas they may share common attributes, nonfungible
    products have unique traits and unique values assigned to those traits. Pokémon
    cards are a great example of nonfungible goods because whereas each one is unique,
    they all follow the same typology. Whereas one person may decide that one card
    is worth trading for another, that’s *their* decision and *their* value judgment;
    the two cards are not inherently equal in value in the same way that two $5 bills
    are.

    metadata about an asset as well as information such as ownership. These additional

- en: Nonfungible ERC-720 tokens (NFTs) are noninterchangeable and cannot be replaced
    with other tokens of the same type. If you lend the token to someone, you expect
    them to return the same token. For instance, if a museum lends a Leonardo DaVinci
    painting to another museum for an exhibition, it wouldn’t be too impressed if
    it received a Leonardo DiCaprio back. NFTs are unique, with individual attributes
    that make them irreplaceable or impossible to swap. Think of them as like concert
    tickets—while each ticket is to the same concert, each one has a different seat
    number. Furthermore, unlike our dollar, NFTs cannot be divided. In much the same
    way that your college degree cannot be shared or swapped with someone else’s (which
    is a shame—how many of us really know what they want to do for the rest of our
    lives at that age … or, in my case, at any age?).

- en: The ERC-721 standards document an asset’s ownership, approval, transfer, and
    other metadata. It enables you to record all your asset’s valuable and conclusive

    that are indivisible and irreplaceable, such as a commodity, a contract, or a
    qualification. Conversely, NFTs can be used to represent unique goods such as
    a ticket, a bottle of wine, a piece of jewelry, and others. Tokenizing these unique
    objects of value allows you to trace the ownership, and in the process, you build
    a connection between information about the object and the value of the object.
    NFTs enable recording of the ownership of indivisible and unique assets, and an
    ownership record on blockchain makes the record transparent and tamper-resistant.

    Asia. Altitude is developing Battle Racers, an arcade racing game on the blockchain.
    She breaks down the intimidation factor of using blockchain in gaming. “Blockchain

    blockchain as a gaming platform, as just a new technology that you can use to
    build games on.”

- en: '1. Decentralization: “In traditional video games like World of Warcraft, you
    can play for a long time and have a super-maxed out character with all maxed out
    gear. You probably worked very hard and invested time and money into developing
    this character. But the data is all centralized; it’s stored on their servers.
    If anything happens to those servers, whether accidental or the company decides
    to delete your account, then you lose a year of your hard work. That’s just how
    it is. Now, imagine if you have a character where data doesn’t live in one place.
    With blockchain game design, if you are building on Ethereum, you have decentralization.
    Some amazing functionalities and features also become possible.”'
  id: totrans-115

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 1. 去中心化：“在传统的视频游戏如《魔兽世界》中，你可以玩很长时间，并拥有一个超级满级的角色和全部满级的装备。你可能非常努力地工作，投入时间和金钱来培养这个角色。但是，所有数据都是集中的，存储在他们服务器上。如果服务器有任何问题，无论是意外还是公司决定删除你的账户，那么你将失去一年努力工作的成果。事实就是这样。现在，想象一下如果你有一个角色，数据不存储在一个地方。通过区块链游戏设计，如果你建立在以太坊上，你就有去中心化。一些惊人的功能和特性也成为可能。”
- en: '2. True ownership: Javier goes on to explain that blockchain allows for very
    real ownership. “Still using the World of Warcraft example, you as a player don’t
    own your character or gear. You are just borrowing them for some time. If the
    game company shuts down, your items are gone. If the item lives on the blockchain,
    then we have ‘true item ownership.’ I own this the same way I own a physical Magic:
    The Gathering card. If I bought a Magic deck of cards, even if Wizards of the
    Coast were to shut down, I still own the cards. I can do whatever I want with
    them because I bought them and I hold them. We have never been able to do that
    with digital assets before the blockchain.”'

  zh: 2. 真正所有权：javier继续解释说，区块链允许真正的所有权。“仍然使用《魔兽世界》的例子，你作为玩家并不拥有你的角色或装备。你只是暂时借用它们。如果游戏公司关闭，你的物品就消失了。如果物品存放在区块链上，那么我们就有了‘真正的物品所有权’。我拥有这张卡片的方式和我拥有一张实体《万智牌》一样。如果我买了一副万智牌，即使海岸巫师关闭了，我仍然拥有这些卡片。我可以随心所欲地处理它们，因为我买了它们并且持有它们。在区块链之前，我们从未能够这样处理数字资产。”
- en: 'She emphasizes that true ownership allows you to bring your characters and
    assets to another game: “Because you own this character, you can decide to play
    another game with it. So if I own my World of Warcraft character, I could bring
    it into another game.”'

- en: “A blockchain item can be used across different properties, and we call that
    ‘interoperability.’ This is what the developers are excited about; we can collaborate
    and support one another. This was also not possible before. In the past, companies
    would never share items across games. They wouldn’t even share items across their
    own games! Now, these blockchain items and characters are independent of the companies
    where they originated. And they have real-world value! I could sell my digital
    item to somebody else the same way I could sell a Magic card to somebody else.
    And Wizards of the Coast has no control over that.”

  zh: “区块链项目可以在不同的项目中使用，我们称之为‘互操作性’。开发者们对此感到兴奋；我们可以合作和支持彼此。这在过去是不可能的。过去，公司永远不会在游戏之间共享物品。他们甚至不会在它们自己的游戏之间共享物品！现在，这些区块链项目和角色与它们起源的公司独立开来。并且它们有真实世界的价值！我可以像卖一张万智牌一样把我的数字物品卖给另一个人。并且海岸巫师对此无能为力。”
- en: '3. Gamers as investors: “This brings us to another valuable characteristic.
    We are used to buying a console game and paying $60 upfront. Or in mobile games,
    you don’t pay anything upfront, but you can keep paying for in-app purchases.
    On average, players pay about a $100 for a console game and about $90 for a mobile
    game. With blockchain users, based on a September 2018 report, it was about $200
    per blockchain gaming user—approximately twice as much. People are spending a
    lot of money.”'

- en: “Blockchain gamers are more like investors. They want to buy these items and
    make their money back. That’s a different mindset to understand and cater for.
    A blockchain game developer has to design a game where your players earned their
    investment back. These three characteristics of blockchain we didn’t have before
    on any other platform.”

    You can imagine a car that’s been around for 3 months and passed around from owner
    to owner. This car is getting older because you can’t change the parts of the
    car and new parts are coming up all the time. It becomes vintage, famous, just
    like a car in the real world. And as you win with the car, you earn exclusive
    bonus stats that you can’t get anywhere else. It becomes stronger, faster. The
    car becomes a legend and accumulates value.

    sovereignty over our data. The blockchain enables new possibilities such as decentralized

    That would start to identify who engages with their content the most, whether
    through liking, commenting, sharing things, reposting, etc. to create lists of
    what we could identify as “avid fans.” Then there are some further clarifications
    where you want to identify not just obsessive fans, but ordinary fans who know
    and are into the band. If somebody leaves a comment on a thread on a social channel
    and other people like it, that’s a signifier that it created or added some value
    to the conversation, as opposed to somebody just regularly posting stuff that
    doesn’t matter. We are working through some of those things to bring that to the

    social channel 的线程中留下评论，而其他人喜欢它，这是创造或增加对话价值的标志，而不是一些人只是定期发布无关紧要的内容。我们正在处理一些这些问题，以将它们带到台前。

    the equivalents of negotiable instruments and electronic chattel paper would be
    digital assets, as would an electronic recording of a security interest in the
    underlying asset. It is similar to recording title to real or personal property
    and the use of tokens to represent revenue streams from otherwise illiquid assets
    such as patents and commercial real estate (sometimes referred to as a “tokenized”
    or digitized asset).
