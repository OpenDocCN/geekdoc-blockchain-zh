- en: 'Chapter 1: Blockchain and CryptocurrencyBlockchain at Its InceptionThe concept
    behind ‘Blockchain’ technology was first outlined in 1991 by research scientists
    Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They proposed a computationally practical
    method that added time stamps to digital documents, so that they could not be
    backdated or altered. The system was to use an encrypted chain of blocks to store
    the time-stamped documents. In 1992, Merkle trees were included in the design.
    A Merkle tree is a structure used by computer applications to organize data. This
    made it possible for multiple documents to be collected and stored in one block.
    After its development, the technology was not used and the patent ended up lapsing
    in 2004.In that same year, a computer scientist named Harold Finney launched a
    system called RPoW or Reusable Proof of Work. The system worked by collecting
    non-exchangeable Hashcash based Proof of work tokens and then generating an RSA.
    It is a signed token that could be passed on from person to person. Hashcash is
    a proof-of-work model and RSA is a technique used to encrypt a public-key used
    for secure data transmission especially over the internet. When you are spending
    tangible money, it’s hard to spend the same coin or note twice, because the transaction
    is happening in the presence of one or more people. Double spending was a term
    coined after the rise of bitcoin, it describes the possibility of spending the
    same unit of cryptocurrency more than once. RPoW solved this problem by keeping
    records of the ownership of tokens and registering them on a server that allowed
    users to validate their authenticity immediately.In 2008, a Whitepaper was posted
    to a cryptography mailing list by someone, or a group of people, using the pseudonym
    Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper presented a decentralized, peer-to-peer, electronic
    cash system based on the Hashcash POW algorithm, called Bitcoin. (Binance Academy,
    2018). It proposed the use of a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that could
    trail and validate any and all transactions.On the 3rd of January 2009, the first
    Bitcoin block was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. It yielded him a reward of 50 Bitcoins.
    The first ever Bitcoin transaction took place on the 12th of January when Nakamoto
    sent Harold Finney 10 Bitcoins.Blockchain TodayIn 2013, a programmer named Vitalik
    Buterin expressed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for building decentralized
    applications. He then started developing a new Blockchain-based distributed computing
    system called Ethereum. A distributed computing system has numerous pieces of
    software on several computers but run as one system. The computers in the system
    can either be in close proximity to each other sharing a local network, or they
    can be dispersed in different areas and connected by a Wide-area network. Ethereum
    has a scripting feature called Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts that
    are implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain. They can be used to make transactions
    if specific conditions are met. They are written in specific coding languages
    and arranged into Bytecode. Bytecode is source code that has been simplified for
    a software interpreter to understand. The Ethereum Virtual machine then reads
    and executes the transactions. The EVM is often called a virtual CPU because it
    is not tangible and is run on hundreds of machines worldwide.Developers can produce
    apps that run inside the Ethereum Blockchain. These apps are called DApps (Decentralized
    Applications). There are hundreds of apps running on the Ethereum blockchain,
    including various social media platforms. Blockchain technology is becoming more
    conventional and is even used in applications outside of the cryptocurrency space.How
    Does a Blockchain Work?Blockchain is an apt name for this system. Like the name
    states, a blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain information. It is a distributed
    ledger that is open to anyone. A ledger is a bookkeeping system that contains
    all of a company’s financial data. It records each and every transaction that
    happens from day one. It also contains the account information that company’s
    use to prepare their financial statements.Once data has been recorded inside a
    block it is virtually impossible to change. Each block has three components; the
    data, the hash and the previous block’s hash. The data depends on what kind of
    block it is. The hash works the same way a fingerprint does in that it can’t be
    duplicated and you can use it to identify a single block and all it’s content.If
    a piece of data in the block changes, so does the hash. Hashes are useful because
    they help in identifying any changes that have happened within a block. The hash
    of the previous block is what links all the blocks together like a chain. This
    is what makes a blockchain so secure.If we had three blocks in one chain then
    block three would contain block two’s hash and block two would contain block one’s
    hash. The first block only has its own hash so it’s called the Genesis block.In
    the event that the second block is interfered with, its hash will change and that
    would invalidate all the blocks that come afterward because block three would
    not contain a valid hash. While a blockchain is inherently secure, computers are
    developing and increasing their capabilities on a daily basis so it’s not impossible
    for blocks to be interfered with.To abate any interference, blockchains have something
    called Proof of Work (PoW). PoW works to slow down the building of new blocks.
    It’s helpful because if you were to meddle with block two, you would have to do
    the proof of work for every block that comes after it.In order to manage the chain,
    blockchain uses a Peer-to-peer network. A peer-to-peer network is where two or
    more computers are able to share files without having to connect to one server.
    As soon as a new user joins the network they have full access to the entire blockchain
    and all its data. The node is used to verify the data. A node can either be a
    redistribution point, a communication endpoint or a connection point. In a blockchain
    it is a connection point. A node can register information, process it and then
    send it to other nodes.If a new block is added it gets sent to all the computers
    on the network. The node verifies the block and then adds it to the blockchain.
    All the nodes in the network create consensus by agreeing on which blocks are
    valid and which are not. If a block has been interfered with it gets rejected
    by all the nodes in the network.Because blocks are constantly changing, Smart
    Contracts were developed. They are programs that are kept in the blockchain. They
    automatically exchange coins if certain conditions are met.Different Types of
    BlockchainsPrivate BlockchainsAccess to Private blockchains is invitation based.
    Users can be validated by a rule set by the central administrator of the network.
    Only some users can have access to the network and of those few, there are limits
    on the kinds of transactions they can perform. These kinds of blockchains use
    a Proof of Authority consensus approach (PoA). PoA is part of a consensus algorithm
    that gives a small group of users on a blockchain the authority to validate transactions
    on the network. PoA is mostly used within secure business environments to control
    access and record keeping because the transaction data is not usually visible
    to them.Public BlockchainsPublic blockchains are all about engagement and transparency.
    Transaction consensus is not centralized, so anybody can take part in authenticating
    network transactions and the software code is open source. This means it is available
    to the public. Public blockchains are decentralized through crypto-economics to
    promote cooperation throughout a network. There isn’t a sole entity controlling
    the network and there is no central point of failure. The consensus algorithms
    used in a public blockchain are PoW and Proof of Stake (PoS). PoS is an algorithm
    that processes transactions and creates new blocks in a chain. It is used to validate
    any data entries and keep the database secure.Consortium BlockchainsNo one ever
    talks about Consortium blockchains because they are not widely used. They can
    be described as a combination of both public and private blockchains because they
    have a ‘semi-permissioned’ approach. Consortium blockchains’ participants are
    usually known and have been authorized by a central authority to participate in
    the consensus. This kind of blockchain is semi-decentralized while still offering
    some level of control. Transaction data is also kept private. Consortium blockchains
    make use of all three consensus algorithms; PoW, PoS, and PoA.What Is Cryptocurrency?Most
    people know what cryptocurrency is, but not many understand it. Until around ten
    years ago, all forms of modern currency were controlled and regulated by banks
    and governments. This means that the regulatory authority was centralized, and
    that restricted the capabilities of tangible money and credit cards. While modern
    banking has come a long way in recent years, it has its issues. When two parties
    are exchanging money, it’s possible for there to be a single point of failure.
    The bank can have a glitch in the system or one party’s transfer limit could have
    been reached.Cryptocurrency removes all the problems of modern banking because
    there is no single point of failure. A single point of failure happens when a
    vital part of a system ceases to function, thus causing the entire system to fail.
    Crypto is a virtual currency that is used as a medium of exchange. It works in
    a similar way to any other currency, it just isn’t tangible and operates using
    cryptography. Cryptography is a way to protect information using code, so that
    only the relevant parties have access to it.Cryptocurrency Key Features●     Cryptocurrency
    is decentralizedBanks and governments control the economic system in the outside
    world. In the digital realm, there are no third-parties and transactions can be
    processed and authenticated via an open network that doesn’t belong to an entity.●     Cryptocurrency
    is immutableWhen something is immutable, it cannot be changed.●     Cryptocurrency
    is anonymousThere is no need for users to identify themselves when trading cryptocurrency
    because there is no third-party. The network processes, authenticates and documents
    all transactions on the blockchain.●     Cryptocurrency has a finite supplyWhen
    most cryptocurrency is created, it has a predetermined amount to be mined out
    of the system. Other digital currencies may not have an actual limit, but they
    do control the amount of new coins that can be generated on a yearly basis.●     Transactions
    are irreversibleBecause there is no management by any central authority, there
    isn’t a body or an organization that can intervene when any kind of mistake is
    made. So if you were making a transaction and you happened to enter the wrong
    details and it gets sent through, it cannot be reversed and there is no organization
    that you can reach out to for support.Characteristics of a Good Cryptocurrency●     SecurityAnybody
    who has assets they can’t actually touch wants to be sure that they are safe at
    all times. Cryptocurrencies stay in a digital ‘wallet’. A wallet is essentially
    just a long line of letters and numbers. It can also be called a private key and
    it allows its owner to withdraw coins. There is a shorter line of numbers linked
    to the private key that allows a user to accept deposits. This number is called
    a public key. When two wallets share a transaction, that data is entered into
    a block which is then added to a ledger. Once all of this information reaches
    the ledger it cannot be changed.●     ScalabilityWhen a cryptocurrency is scalable,
    it means it can confirm a large number of transactions, usually per second. When
    trading cryptocurrency, a user wants to know that all transactions are going to
    happen fairly quickly and without fail. Because of innovations in technology there
    are apps that offer speedy transactions of normal money like Paypal. This means
    that cryptocurrencies need to be processed at a speed of no more than 3 seconds
    at a time.●     UsabilityLike most things, cryptocurrency needs to be easy to
    navigate. It can be daunting for a new user or for somebody who is considered
    a technophobe. A well developed cryptocurrency has a lot of complicated things
    going on in the background but should always appear to be easy on the user’s end.
    Also, it is always best to use cryptocurrencies that you can transact with via
    a mobile app and not on a web page.●     DemandThe more demand there is for any
    given cryptocurrency, the more valuable it becomes. When there is enough interest
    in the market and the price of a certain coin rises, it will be beneficial to
    users.●     Finite supplyMost, if not all cryptocurrencies have a limited amount
    of coins in existence. The number of coins available is determined upon inception
    and was calculated by mathematics. Some cryptocurrencies release all their coins
    at once and others release them bit by bit in an attempt to keep the price stable.
    In the long run, a good cryptocurrency is determined by its adherence to good
    economic practices.'
