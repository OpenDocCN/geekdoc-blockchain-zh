    almost always made online. For example, website purchases for ringtones, pay-per-views,
    downloads, e-books, and subscriptions in the $1 to $5 range would be considered

    Since Bitcoin was created in 2009, many theorized about the future of the financial

    AUD, euros, or Japanese yen, it cannot be touched. It is also much easier to send
    across borders, especially in large amounts. For these reasons, anything related
    to money, value, and currency is likely a natural application of blockchain technology.

    blockchain can speed up payments made at lower rates than those charged by banks.
    With clearing and settlement, blockchain can reduce, in almost real time, transactions
    between financial institutions. For fundraising, blockchain can provide companies
    with immediate access to capital through the initial placement of coins (ICO).

    of the capital market. All transaction records are secured by cryptography and
    tied to previous transactions and distributed among participants in a ledger.
    For loans, blockchain can make borrowing money safer and provide lower interest
    rates by eliminating the need for credit intermediaries.[4](16_ch07.xhtml#ch07en4)

    representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, and other units of value,
    such as frequent flyer miles or mobile minutes to facilitate cross-border payments.
    Among others, MoneyGram and Western Union have announced partnerships with Ripple.
    By lowering the costs of blockchain-based cryptocurrency transfers, users of blockchain
    can eliminate the need for banks, and in doing so, can speed up transactions and
    eliminate the need for banks and reduce transfer costs.[7](16_ch07.xhtml#ch07en7)

    by any one individual. It is held in smart contracts instead, which means funds
    can only be used under certain conditions.[30](16_ch07.xhtml#ch07en30)

    and Teambrella[32](16_ch07.xhtml#ch07en32) use blockchain to remove intermediaries,
    decrease costs, and shift to a peer-to-peer model.

- en: As we’ve seen, blockchain’s ability to harness the power of small is one of
    its greatest assets. By making quick, small sum payments easy and efficient, blockchain
    unlocks a world of possibilities for all industries. From the world of microinsurance
    to object-to-object communication, micropayments promise to smoothen out inefficiencies
    by eliminating unnecessary payments—and possibly even the roads we drive on by
    spreading information about potholes. Miscommunication and risk are inherent to
    life; but with blockchain, they’ll become a lot less costly as usage-based or
    outcome-based business models evolve, assets are optimized, and products become
    more like services.
