    attestation services it is always difficult to know what to include as current
    news or current use cases, but several trends do appear worth of inclusion as
    current or topical news stories.

    of blockchains do appear to be generating large amounts of interest and investment
    in the technology landscape (Culp [2008](#CR3)). The reasoning behind this adoption
    is relatively straight forward due to the efficiencies and benefits able to be
    generated through collaborative efforts. In addition to the Big 4 accounting firms
    working together, the broader trend and development toward collaboration and cooperation
    points to an interesting concept and idea. Even between organizations that normally
    compete very hard for business and clients, the idea of an industry or sector
    wide blockchain platform is appealing. Digging deeper into this concept, it seems
    logical to revisit an earlier point and perspective that has been mentioned throughout
    this text; the industry desire for increased regulation and oversight.

- en: Currently the regulatory backdrop for blockchain and cryptocurrency in general
    is akin to a patchwork effect, which has led to different interpretations and
    dealings with various aspects of the blockchain and cryptocurrency field itself.
    On the one hand it is important for industry actors to have clear frameworks and
    guidelines within which they can operate, and several professional associations
    and advocacy groups have taken leadership in attempting to define and clarify
    what exactly those guidelines should be. This somewhat interesting and contradictory
    view, of industry actors and players seeking our increased regulation and oversight,
    actually makes perfect sense when a broader perspective is utilized. Specifically,
    and as different organizations continue to make investments on both blockchain
    sides or individual cryptocurrencies it is important to make sure that these investments,
    ideally, do not end up being contrary to what the regulators end up instituting
    as the rules of the marketplace (Corson [2016](#CR2)). From a financial systems
    and markets perspective and point of view, ensuring that the products and services
    instituted by a variety of firms remain in compliance with market movements and
    trends is important. Practitioners, in addition to the work and effort involved
    in the building out and implementation of different blockchain options, might
    also be able to capitalize on the decentralization trends in terms of career plans
    or locations.

    involvement and integration is the simple fact that, via disintermediation, distributed
    ledgers and sources of information, there will be a disruption of current status
    quos across the board. Specifically the development of new hubs and centers of
    excellence connected to these emerging technologies will lead to different opportunities
    and openings for motivated and proactive financial professionals. This might not
    be as radical an idea, however, as it might initially seem to be when viewed in
    the context of what is already happening in the financial markets at large. For
    example, Goldman Sachs – a venerable financial institution in its own right with
    historic ties to traditional financial centers (including New York City) has recently
    opened an office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Driven by a variety of forces, including
    the talent that exists in that local market as well as the lower costs that can
    be obtained in Utah, this office has been the fastest growing office for years
    now. While there are always going to be benefits and upsides to working in a physical
    location, the opportunities or leveraging technology for more and more fundamental
    business aspects will inevitably lead to a wider dispersion of talent, capital,
    and information.

    on financial services firms from an internal operation perspective, such a movement
    and shift will also lead to more advisory service opportunities (Doran and Brown
    [2001](#CR4)). An example of this would increasingly be the creation and establishment
    of peer to peer lending platforms, ride sharing apps, and distributed rental property
    opportunities for consumer use. If these sound like current services and options
    that exist in the marketplace such as Lending Club, Uber, and AirBnb that is because
    they are. The true value, however, or a blockchain based business model and platform,
    is that even the administration and oversight involved around the managing of
    an organization does need to be centralized in any aspect of section. As discussed
    in depth throughout this text the implications of a decentralized and distributed
    model of founding, running, and managing a business must also be part of the financial
    conversation.

    working in industry, what this means is that the playing field has rarely been
    as level or as open to new entrants. As companies can operate and conduct business
    on a decentralized and rapidly automated basis, advisors and professionals are
    going to have to be able to keep pace with the changing expectations and requirements
    of these organizations (Campbell-Verduyn and Goguen [2018](#CR1)). Specifically,
    practitioners will have the ability to audit, attest, and advise clients of different
    aspects of client operations and business as they pertain to a variety of needs
    and questions. Decentralizing financial information, as discussed in the section
    focusing on lex cryptographica also ties back to an important aspect of advisory
    services that financial and other practitioners can add to the conversation.

    this text, and revisited here in the context of offering new services, that initial
    conversation only convers the preliminary layer of how distributed and decentralized
    technology may change business at large. Obvious applications of said technology
    are, of course, the ability of organizations and individuals to access capital
    and other resources on a continuous and widespread basis as opposed to relying
    on central hubs for information. Additionally, this decentralization of access
    to capital and other types of technological and advisory services will invariably
    lead to a rebalancing of establishment of new centers of excellence as these technologies
    become more widely integrated throughout the economy (Simunic and Biddle [2019](#CR6)).
    These are important considerations to factor into any analysis or model, but are
    higher level concerns that might not directly impact current clients or services.
    Let’s take a look at a few items that might do just that.
  prefs: []

- en: From a legalistic perspective, a decentralized organization still remains something
    of an anomaly in terms of how it should be classified and treated. As of this
    writing a purely decentralized organization is not formally recognized as a legal
    model in and of itself, but is most closely affiliated with the model of a general
    partnership, which may or may also impact various corporate governance and voting
    policies (Syeed [2018](#CR7)). Depending on the specifics of just how the organization
    is structured, and the types of tokens that are issued during the formation of
    the company, a general partnership agreement and operating structure is a logical
    choice. For those financial professionals not intimately familiar with the workings
    of the legal system this might not seem like an extremely important piece of information,
    but can have potentially disastrous consequences for investors. If, for example,
    individuals or investment funds have participated in ICOs, STOs, or other types
    of fundraising activities connected to blockchain based business models they may
    have inadvertently be exposing themselves to unlimited liability depending on
    the operations of the business. This often unaddressed fact or piece of information
    is something that has not been discussed all that much even during the hype and
    excitement related to the ICO and STO marketplace. Specifically from a regulatory
    perspective it is important to understanding that technology and regulatory approaches
    tend to not only interact with each other, but influence each other as the ecosystem
    continues to evolve and mature (Gump and Leonard [2016](#CR5)). Fortunately, there
    does appear to be a solution that might be able to lawyers and financial professionals
    advise clients; the segregated limited liability corporation (SLLC).

- en: Prior to drilling down into just what exactly this business model may mean for
    organizations and their advisors it is important to point out that this example
    and information further illustrates the importance of working in multidisciplinary
    teams moving forward. Particularly, as organizations ranging from JP Morgan to
    Facebook enter the blockchain financial services space, it does not appear illogical
    to conclude that blockchain is rapidly becoming a hot and timely topic in the
    banking and financial services space (Yu [2016](#CR9)). The advent and integration
    of blockchain based systems, especially when it is stacked or combined with artificial
    intelligence or other automation technologies, means that no one professional
    sector is going to have a monopoly on expertise nor the ability to offer advice.
    Even though financial professionals have worked together in the past with legal
    experts and teams this relationship will have to become more solidified in the
    future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to the rather obvious legal questions and considerations that will
    arise with the advent of new business models and business structures, there are
    associated questions and considerations that need to be taken into account. An
    SLLC, for example, is simply a method and model by which different assets and
    information can be segregated and structured to isolate different types of content
    and information from other information. How this might work, for example, is that
    by segregating the piece of data and information stored and managed via a decentralized
    and distributed business model, such a separation may result in limited liability
    for different stakeholders and token holders. If, as a result of issuing a security
    token – as defined by the SEC during 2018 and 2019 – results in token holders
    having shared or the profits and operations of the organization, this is not an
    academic question given the scope of business being conducted in such a manner.
    Billions have been raised via ICOs and STOs during the excitement and buzz around
    blockchain, and with these billions there are associated issues related to liability,
    exposure, and corporate governance that must be addressed.

- en: On top of the legal issues and considerations that must be factored into the
    conversation and debate there is also a fiduciary responsibility that financial
    professionals must be aware of as decentralized organizations continue to proliferate
    (van Rijswijk et al. [2019](#CR8)). Clients, both individual and institutional
    in nature, may be interested in participating in, investing in, and even leading
    a decentralized structure itself. One of the first decentralized organizations,
    theDAO, offers a perfect example of what can occur is risks and associated potential
    liabilities are not accounted for appropriately. Running, like the vast majority
    of decentralized blockchain models, on the Ethereum blockchains, this organization
    had raised in excess of $150 million USD during the early days of the blockchain
    industry. Revealing a potential fatal flaw in the decentralized and distributed
    model of blockchain itself the code that underpinning the DAO was hacked and manipulated
    which, in essence, led to members of theDAO being locked out of the organization
    itself. After a manual intervention by the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin,
    the situation was ultimately resolved, but no without the loss of financial resources,
    reputational damage, and shaking of faith in the idea of decentralized blockchain
    model at large. These fiduciary implications and associated risks that can accompany
    a new type of business model and structure are items that every practitioner needs
    to be aware of moving forward.

    working either entrepreneurs, for example, the ability to raise capital from a
    truly global audience on a near instantaneous basis increases the liquidity and
    depth of the marketplace at large. What this means, however, is that on top of
    being aware of current trends and forces connected to blockchain applications
    and iterations that professionals will need to also keep themselves informed about
    emerging trends in the future as well.

    front. Specifically, and before any AI tool should be implemented, the processes

    organization to several well documented issues that often occur when attempting
    large enterprise level ERP upgrades, installations, or reinstallations. Budget
    overruns, compatibility issues, and the reality that no tool or product works
    exactly right the first time means that many AI projects may hit stumbling blocks
    prior to generating many of the promised or assumed benefits. While something
    that may happen with relative frequency that does not make it any easier for organizations
    or management teams faced with these challenges. Providing steady guidance and

    organizations. For example, while financial services professionals may be specifically
    interested in the implications and applications of computation AI for accelerating
    the processing of data, client organizations might be more interested in spatial,
    linguistic, or other forms of artificial intelligence. Having a fundamental understanding
    of these different types of AI, and being conversant in describing the differences
    between them, is something that financial services professionals will need to

    be receiving substantial buzz, analysis, and investment in the marketplace, but
    it is equally as important to realize that the evolution and transition to true
    artificial intelligence is going to be a process rather than a one-time event.
    Whether it begins via an RPA implementation project or some other form of automation,
    the underlying relationship is unchanged. Put simply, artificial intelligence
    as currently understood and discussed in the marketplace will require several
    iterative steps and processes to actually generate many of the expected benefits.
    Financial services professionals can offer advice and guidance not only on how
    AI may integrate with current systems, but also advise on the iterative between
    current processes and full AI implementation.

    artificial intelligence become more widespread in the marketplace is an underlying
    point to keep in mind is that there is still home for human practitioners in a
    digitally based and driven economy. No matter how sophisticated the technology
    itself may be, the underlying processes and business controls must still be robust,
    reinforced, and updated to keep pace with the changing expectations and needs
    of end users. Decentralization, a distributed sharing and analysis of information,
    and the automation of different data processes will create efficiency and productivity
    gains, but must also be offset and framed within appropriate controls and guardrails.

- en: Something that is becoming more of a mainstream topic for professionals to debate,
    especially in terms of market applications, is how ethical decision making and
    ethics in general can be integrated within AI programs. At the current pace of
    development, many industry and computer experts speculate that AI programs that
    are either self aware or able to act of their own volition are mere years away.
    Compounding this potential it is also logical to acknowledge that AI – or other
    automation programs – are driving and handling large amounts of the decision making
    process. Credit card approvals, transaction processing, stock trading, journal
    entry posting and reconciliations, and other financial analysis procedures are
    already in large part automated or at least partially automated. Let’s take a
    look at an example that financial advisors and market makes need to certainly
    keep an eye as these trends continue to become more prominent. Certain investors
    or classes of investors may, for a variety of reasons, want to only invest in
    companies aligned with certain ESG goals and objectives. Even those this preference
    may be expressed and programmed into investing programs and algorithms, there
    is still going to be a need for human oversight and control. Investing decisions
    are certainly high profile enough by themselves, but that is not the only area
    in which ethics needs to be integrated into the business decision making process.

    mortgages respectively is another which artificial intelligence is already being
    utilized to a certain extent with more developments and tools on the way. Providing
    credit to creditworthy customers and organizations is a function and process that
    provide vital services to the broader economy at large, and is something that
    is important for all practitioners to be aware of as technology becomes increasingly
    integrated into how business is conducted. During the Great Recession of 2008,
    for example, was precipitated and prolonged by the fact that the lending market
    connected to the extension of credit had dried up, depriving organizations and
    individuals or much needed capital and resources. Returning to the idea of business
    formation and creation, the primary reason why most new small businesses fail
    is due to lack of capital and financing; being able to make timely and effective
    decisions connected to these needs is something that is incredibly important.
  prefs: []

- en: Automation programs of all kinds, including full blown artificial intelligence
    as well as RPA and automation software embedded into the lending process can increase
    the speed with which these decisions and choices can be made. Even in current
    organizations and conversations there are multiple software tools and programs
    that are augmenting and improving the speed with which individuals and organizations
    can decided upon. Drawing from publicly available information, including data
    posted on social media and other information available online there are a multitude
    of ways that approval and denials can be automated or accelerated without detracting
    from the quality of the decision making process. These improvements, however,
    can also lead to the approval process being influenced by factors and information
    not directly related to the financial situation of the client. Even though this
    information may be helpful in terms of assessing the market reach and influence
    of an individual or business, it can also lead to information being misused or
    misinterpreted in the context of business approvals.

    intent attract negative comments or feedback can have a negative impact on whether
    or not the loan or financing is approved. This risk may sound abstract or not
    entirely important from a financial services perspective, but it is something
    that should be taken into account as AI and other automation programs are implemented
    within organizations. While humans and other manual reviewers can assist in offsetting
    some of the negative feedback and news that is prevalent on social media an AI
    program or other sort of automatic reviewing program might not be able to discern
    fake news from true negative news. This lack of intellectual dexterity may not
    be evident in the course of normal approvals and verifications, but can rear its
    ugly head when potentially applied to potential customers and borrowers who might

    of business and other types of information is centralized in nature. Healthcare  ,
    land records, taxation information, customer data, financial information and history,
    and almost anything other large data set you can think of operates in a centralized
    environment. Customer information, including purchase history, credit card information,
    and data linked to rewards programs and loyalty cards are also often stored within
    a centralized data hierarchy. Now, there are certainly benefits associated with
    this methodology, namely the speed and efficiency that has been traditionally
    linked with a centralized data management and processing structure. With a central
    hub tasked with verifying, clearing, and securing information, those somewhat
    mundane tasks were effectively outsourced to an independent third party. Even
    with these associated benefits, however, the recurring specter of hacks, breaches,
    and other data incident have been occurring with a frightening degree of frequency

    to a lesser extent than accounting professionals, every financial services professional –
    be it a financial advisor, financial planner, or otherwise affiliated individual –
    has traditionally held a role akin to third party verifier of data and information.
    What is similar across industry lines, however, is that the entire role of accounting
    and financial services professionals is to help third party users of data understand,
    report, and verify what exactly is being reported. In effect, the centralized
    nature of most data storage and processing has created the very role and responsibility
    inhabited and embraced by accounting and financial services professionals. Creators
    of information, end users of information, and every party in between are usually

    this is where the accounting and finance professionals currently and traditionally

    generated and conveyed by accounting practitioners and firms traditionally has
    been to serve as independent, objective, and trustworthy third parties to analyze,
    report, and verify that the data provided is accurate. The peer-to-peer nature
    of the blockchain ecosystem, however, renders the necessity of a third party or
    other sort of independent verifier of data less necessary. Encryption, real time
    communication of data, and the ability of network members to verify data as it
    is uploaded onto the blockchain itself means that the creators of information
    can, instead of third parties, actively verify and confirm the veracity of said
    data. This transition may seem abstract in nature, but actually represents a true

    Accounting and finance professionals, whether employed within private industry,
    public practice, or working on an entrepreneurial basis, are almost universally
    tasked with serving as trusted advisors, intermediaries, or other interpreters
    of data. Bank reconciliations, auditors, tax preparers and examiners, and other

    agencies are each a centralized method of communicating data, issuing opinions
    on certain issues, and enforcing guidelines. As was clearly demonstrated during
    the financial crisis that began in 2007, these centralized models and agencies
    did not, at the very least, foresee some of the underlying forces that eventually
    caused the global financial meltdown. There is certainly enough blame to go around

    in just how the data compiled and assembled by an organization. As data becomes

    not new challenges, nor are these issues going to be immediately resolved by simply
    using new technology tools. That said, and especially as the fortunes or markets
    and organizations can be impacted by Tweets and other social media interactions,
    the lag and delays in how financial data is verified and communicated does not
    appear to sync with the speed with which business is now conducted.

    data and information can be verified, also opens the door for new potential investors
    on a global basis. Traditional infrastructure requirements for investing, banking,
    and trading require an investment in technological, communicative, and financial
    tools and platforms. Blockchain, specifically the iteration and application of
    cryptocurrencies, allows individuals and institutions to communicate, send financial
    information, and transmit data equipped only with a laptop, reliable internet
    connection, or even a robust mobile tool like a tablet. Financial services professionals,
    especially those employed in the wealth management and personal financial planning
    area, tend to play several roles for clients. First, and perhaps the most important
    role they tend to play is that of market analyst and interpreter. Namely, the
    job of many financial planning professionals is to ensure that clients understand
    what specific types of information is verifiable, accurate, and can be used to
    make more effective decisions. As increasing amounts of information are stored,
    verified, and available on blockchain enabled platforms, the necessity for manual
    review and interpretation will, by any reasonable estimate, decrease over time.
    While AI and blockchain may render some current roles and responsibilities redundant
    or obsolete, especially as it comes to reviewing market trends and forces, it
    will also create new opportunities for financial professionals. These new opportunities
    are, at the end of the day, the largest amounts of excitement, investment opportunity
    but also potential buzz and hype focus on these new potential opportunities and
    options for financial professionals.

    executes the trading and buying of securities is nothing new, nor is it something
    that should come as a surprise to anyone affiliated with financial services in
    any capacity. What this increasingly means though, can be summarized in two general
    areas. First, as larger amounts of the overall equity and debt markets are handled
    or traded via computer or automated programs it is also important to understand
    what these different terminologies actually mean. Explained below, what this means
    is that professionals need to understand and integrate what these different terms
    and competencies mean for investing and trading. Prior to that however, the second
    major implications of increased automation is the fact that – in the face of increased
    automation and automatic trade execution – there will be requirements for more
    and more in terms of human oversight. This increased oversight can take the form
    of regulation, manual checks and processes, or periodic reviews but the underlying
    fact pattern remains unchanged.

    in the broader financial services areas is that, although professionals dedicate
    large amounts of effort, energy, and time to providing services, these services
    are not always evaluated as strategic by clients. Specifically, and something
    that often arises in the conversation linked to accounting specific professionals
    is the following reality. Audits, as they are currently constituted and performed,
    tax returns and filings, and even the generation of monthly financial information
    may not normally be perceived as actually adding value to the organization. At
    the end of the day, and regardless of which specific industry or organization
    is analyzed, a core prerogative of management teams is to make effective decisions
    on a continuous basis. What this means in reality is that, in order to definitely
    add value and to be viewed as a true business partner, financial services professionals
    must be able to address the needs of other business professionals.

    been amplified by the increased integration of technology through the entire business
    decision making ecosystem. Analysis of large amounts of information, seeking and
    verifying underlying patterns, extrapolating insights from different imperfect
    data, and offering recommendations all represent work and tasks that can be both
    forward looking and historical in nature. All too often, however, financial professionals
    are only focused on verifying and analyzing the accuracy and validity of information
    that has already happened. While performing these tasks, obviously, does add value
    in terms of reporting and planning it does not usually help in the decision making
    process moving forward. A primary cause of this gap, between what work is currently
    performed and what management teams increasingly expect, can be traced to a few
    critical areas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, financial professionals are often assigned tasks that require a large
    amount of manual time and effort in the form of confirming information, verifying
    the accuracy of data, and making sure that the correct types of information are
    delivered to appropriate end users. These tasks, while time consuming, have formed
    the basis of how many firms have traditionally built successful business models,
    but do not appear assist other management professionals with making decisions
    in a forward looking manner. As AI and blockchain, in whatever final stage is
    adopted by an individual organization, becomes more mainstream, practitioners
    should be able to take advantage of this tools to replace lower level work with
    higher level processes. Second, and something that represents a significant hurdle
    toward financial services professionals spending less time on historical analysis
    is that ensuring the accuracy and completeness of historical information is critically
    important. Whether it has to do with SEC reporting, reports filed for income tax
    purposes, or financial statements delivered to external creditors it often falls
    on the financial services team to ensure that the information is accurate. While
    such work is obviously important from a regulatory and legal perspective, it does
    occupy and detract from time and effort that could otherwise be allocated toward
    more forward looking and strategic work.

    financial services space of innovation, creativity, and doing things different
    than had been previously acceptable. Such as lack of creativity may, of course,
    be grounded in a significant amount of truth and historical precedent. After all,
    some of the most profound failures, bankruptcies, and scandals linked to the financial
    services segment of the economy have been tied to individuals and organizations
    using something akin to creative finance. That said, simply because previous unethical
    actors had conducted themselves in an unethical manner does not mean the innovation
    or approaching topics in news ways should be ignored. Rather, and something at
    the core of this book, is that innovation and creativity in the profession are
    items to embrace, and to leverage with the advances available due to technological
    advancement.

    and broader financial services landscape it is also important to take into account
    the opportunities that are generated and created through automation, the streamlining
    of operations, and the implementation of technology solutions throughout the decision
    making process. Financial services professionals will, almost without a doubt,
    be impacted by the increased automation, digitization, and technological forces
    in the broader business landscape, but it is also something that can, and should,
    generate opportunities for financial services professionals.

    professional services landscape is the forward looking ability these tools will
    provide to individuals. One of the core issues and complaints, from a client and
    customer perspective, is that while the information and data provided may be accurate,
    but that the information normally reported is several weeks (or months) out of

    the automation and streamlining of accounting and finance professions will become
    a powerful force in the marketplace, that the internal control perspective will
    otherwise become important. Maintaining a robust control environment, especially
    as the speed with which transactions and entries can be processed will only increase,
    represents a core role and responsibility that financial professionals must evolve

    ideas and topics for financial services professionals seeking to implement emerging
    technology. Although blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotic process automation,
    and other technology trends may be difficult to analyze from an implementation
    and application perspective it is important for practitioners to remain aware
    of the trends and directions underway in the space. At virtually every accounting
    or finance conference or event the topics and content associated with emerging
    technology tools is also accompanied by predictions of job losses, displacement,
    and erosion or market position. It is important to understand that technology
    trends and automation will result in a changing business landscape, but will also
    create opportunities and openings for forward looking professionals. Taking an
    objective viewpoint and perspective on the implication of emerging technology
    is important from both a practice management point of view as well as the ability
    of professionals to offer advice and guidance to different clients moving forward.
    Understanding both the technology trends itself, as well as the implications these
    trends will have on accounting and finance overall are important facts and trends
    for every practitioner working within the space to remain aware of as these technologies
    become more mainstream. Technologies may change in terms of labels and acronyms,
    but the forces and impacts on the professionals landscape will continue to evolve
    and should be incorporated into the business decision making process across industry
    lines going forward.
