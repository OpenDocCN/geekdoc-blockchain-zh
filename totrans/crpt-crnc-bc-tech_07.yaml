    created. Since then, the law with respect to cryptoassets and smart contracts
    have not been tested as merely not enough consumers and businesses were dealing
    with them; fast-forward to the end of 2017, and the price per 1 BTC was circa
    $20,000.

- en: Two years later, at the end of 2019, the cryptoasset market is now testing,
    particularly legal principles due to the volume of business and wealth concerning
    this market. Infrastructure exists to facilitate the storage and trading of cryptoassets;
    further, smart contracts and derivative contracts exist to allow faster transfer
    of wealth and to speculate on the price of any given cryptoasset. Moreover, there
    are hundreds if not thousands of cryptoassets, with more being created each month.
    The cryptoasset market has grown, and it is now at the point where businesses
    and consumers are unsure where they stand with respect to this new asset. In particular,
    what rights these new assets have and further concerns with respect to the business
    activities they are carrying out and the clarity to understand if they are applicable
    to their business. Examples of theft cases, less-than-ethical businesses practices,
    money laundering concerns and consumer protection concerns are all factors which
    have contributed to organisations such as the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”)
    and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) to investigate and provide guidance.
    Furthermore, we are seeing more civil cases enter and proceed through the commercial
    courts of England and Wales, which implies the value of claim any given claimant
    is seeking, is substantial enough for it to warrant issuing a claim with the courts.

    of cryptoassets, and further, smart contracts. This publication was key in the
    progression of the legal industry dealing with these new conceptual assets, of
    which, characteristics have not been tested in the law previously. The Financial
    Conduct Authorities *Guidance on Cryptoassets* published in January [2019](#b_9783110660807-008_ref_003).
    This guidance was written after an initial statement published by the FCA and

    seeks to clarify the FCA’s position with respect to finance law, specifically
    the Financial Services and Markets Act [2000](#b_9783110660807-008_ref_004). The

- en: Blockchain is the name given to a piece of software, coded in a particular way.
    The key characteristic of a blockchain system is the implantation of an abstract
    process of data storage. Typically programs will store data on the running computer
    hard drive, or a hard drive which the computer running the program is connected
    with, on the Internet; the source of data is from a single hard drive. When a
    piece of software is created implementing blockchain systems, the data of a piece
    of software is stored in several hard drives, simultaneously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating software in this way has a profound effect on the data; in that, once
    the data is within any particular system, it can not be amended or deleted. In
    order to distinguish between typical software and blockchain software, an example
    is set out below.

- en: When one creates a document which contains words, on any particular word processing
    software, one can save the document as a file on the hard drive of the computer
    the software is installed. Alternatively, one may wish to save it on a hard drive
    in a data centre, or a “cloud”. Further, one may wish to save the document at
    each of those places. Each place where the file is saved, the file can be amended
    or deleted. One could make an amendment of the cloud file and save it. If one
    wanted to continue working from that document, one would have to access the file
    stored on the cloud, not on the hard drive of the computer. More importantly,
    if the cloud then corrupts, the file is lost. If the type of data storage was
    blockchain based, one would need to ensure that the computer hard drive is part
    of the blockchain network. Once the file is saved on the computer, it will simultaneously
    be saved on all hard drives that are part of that particular blockchain system.
    If the computer was destroyed, the same file would be accessible. Further, another
    party would not be able to delete or amend the document.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cryptoassets are a strange concept. They are not tangible property which is
    easily identifiable and which we can physically pass to each other. They are not
    intellectual property (“IP”) (although there will inherently be IP in the software
    code which creates cryptoasset through the utilisation to blockchain technology).
    They have been likened to currency; however, the consensus is that it is not currency
    (perhaps currently). Previous chapters in this book will no doubt discuss the
    principles of money in more significant detail and apply them to the current cryptoasset
    landscape. Cryptoassets are a generic name for the existence of a log created
    as a result of the running of a program which utilises the concept of blockchain
    technology. A blockchain program can be designed and used for purposes other than
    creating cryptoassets; however, the characteristics of cryptoassets are likely
    to be contained within the program.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain technology is a concept applied to the software which creates a ledger.
    Inputting data into the ledger containing numbers creates a ledger of a numerical
    account. If the software enables more than an account to exist and the theoretical
    transfer of numeric data from one account to another, you have two accounts in
    the blockchain transferring numbers. The concept of digital accounts that record
    numbers is not new and is currently used widely by banks. When one signs into
    their online banking, they will see their account with numbers, these numbers
    represent the monetary value which the bank owes you. There will be a ledger of
    sorts behind the figures one sees on a banks database. These numbers can, however,
    be altered manually by one who has access to the software; an account can read
    £100 and then for someone with access to accidentally or purposefully add an addition
    “0” at the end. The account will then have £1,000 within it; this is because these
    numbers are just a log to make sure the bank (and we) know how much they owe us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Returning to blockchain systems; this ledger is different from typical ledgers
    (such as the ones a bank would typically use) because the data is stored simultaneously
    on blocks. This has the effect that the data within the ledger can not unilaterally
    be manipulated as the software requires each block to agree and confirm any change.
    This creates a system where a finite amount of numbers exist in a ledger (depending
    on how the software is written); this brings a sense of permanence to the numbers.
    These numbers and entries in the ledger are used and called Cryptoassets. Similarly,
    the data in numbers can be replaced by other data, such as word, patents etc.
    and this is the permanence element of blockchain systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A typical Cryptoasset ledger will typically contain a set amount of numbers,
    (or cryptoassets). Alternatively, the program will have an additional software
    layer which enables users to access the open-source blockchain software to join
    it and become part of the blockchain; as a result, further cryptoassets can be
    created, or “mined”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In conclusion, a cryptoasset is a piece of data which can only be created on
    a blockchain system. Characteristics of a cryptoasset are (but are not limited
    to) that they can be accessed by using a public key (to direct one to the particular
    blockchain), a private key which will allow one to deal with the cryptoassets
    and finally, that any given cryptoasset is unique. A cryptoasset can not be copied,
    deleted or manipulated; it has a sense of permanence.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an element of security is provided by way of the blockchain technology systems,
    smart contracts have been created. A smart contract is a piece of software which
    has the terms and typically the enforceability of the terms, built within the
    code of the piece of software. This could operate outside of the blockchain area;
    however, security would be an issue if blockchain wasn’t used. A smart contract
    could be in the form of a cryptoasset which can be sent and exchanged. That cryptoasset
    may have the term built within it that on a particular date, it will send instructions
    to its own software, to create another cryptoasset and send it to whichever wallet
    it currently exists in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of a smart contract is to enable two parties to interact with security
    and without the fear that the other party may not fulfil their obligation. The
    reason for that is because the obligations are held within the contract and outside
    of the control of either party.

    European Union (“EU”), which is either a Regulation, Directive or Decision. A
    Regulation is a piece of legislation which all EU members must adhere to, as it
    is written. A Directive is a broad set of guidelines; each member state must following

    to a chose in action rather than a chose in possession) which are redeemable for
    an underlying asset, such as several Great British Pounds or BTC. This allows
    the Ripple Network to be used to transfer wealth efficiently, and the asset, which
    the issued Cryptoasset represents, can be redeemed by the original person that
    the Cryptoasset was issued, or the person to whom it has been transferred. In
    the circumstances such as this, more significant thought must be had into the
    rights and classification of the Cryptoasset used to represent the underlying
    asset and furthermore, the underlying asset itself, if it is a Cryptoasset.

    which will then record the new owner and keeper of the motor vehicle. If however
    I asked a friend to purchase a car on my behalf and I give him/her the money to
    purchase the motor vehicle, it would be registered in his/her name. He/she will
    have the legal title to the motor vehicle; however, I have a beneficial interest
    in the vehicle, which can be enforced through the courts.

    one owns a Cryptoasset; there is no central register where all Cryptoassets and
    owners are registered. Neither are they tangible property where one can have physical
    possession of an object, which is prima facie evidence of legal or beneficial
    ownership. Cryptoassets are stored on a wallet on the blockchain; which is shared
    with all other participants of the blockchain; this gives the impression that
    one person can no own them. However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the
    Cryptoassets and the fact a public and a private key is required in order for
    a Cryptoasset is to be dealt with, typically, possession or knowledge of a private
    key is prima facie evidence of ownership. However, if a private key is appropriate,
    it becomes challenging to identify the owner of the Cryptoasset and the courts
    would likely turn to the evidence of fact to determine an owner or the Cryptoasset.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A contract is a legal agreement in law which is defined by its characteristics
    and requires a particular set of requirements to be fulfilled in order for it
    to be legally binding and enforceable. A contract needs to have an offer; the
    Offer needs to be accepted; consideration needs to pass between parties (each
    party receives something in exchange for something else), and there must be intentions
    to be legally bound. A contract can be defined in writing, spoken, or by way of
    conduct. A smart contract is a contract embedded within a piece of software typically
    implementing blockchain technology. The point of a Smart Contract is to code a
    set of obligations of which can be automatically and autonomously carried out.
    It is possible to do this without the implantation of Blockchain technology, however,
    with the implementation of Blockchain technology, for the reasons set out above,
    the terms of the contract are secure; they can not be amended. Therefore there
    is a sense of assurance and reliability that we have not seen or been able to
    rely on typically. A smart contract, in concept, will usually act like an “escrow
    agent” or the way solicitor’s undertakings work. An escrow agent is typically
    used (outside of England and Wales) in a transaction. In contrast, a set of funds
    are held on behalf of both parties on either side of a transaction; to be paid
    on completion of a contractual obligation. This is typically used when obligations
    are fulfilled in tranches, or the value of the contractual obligation is relatively
    substantial.

    perform the obligation as it was intended, where does the fault and liability
    lie, to ensure the damaged party is put in a place if the smart contract had not
    failed? Fortunately, this question has recently been raised in a Court of Appeal
    case in Singapore in the case of Quoine Pte Ltd v B2C2 Ltd [[2020](#b_9783110660807-008_ref_006)]
    SGCA(I) 02\. In this case, the Appellant (Quoine) was a business operating a cryptoasset
    exchange (the “Exchange”) and would also carry out market-making activities to
    create liquidity. The Respondent (B2C2 Ltd) was a trader on the Exchange using
    an algorithmic trading software (“ATS”), created by the director of the Respondent
    and it worked with little human intervention. The ATS was deterministic in that
    it would always give the same output to the corresponding input; however, a failsafe
    existed whereas if the ATS could not receive data, the default position or fail-safe
    would activate and automatically purchase 10 BTC for 1 ETH. In 2017 the Respondent
    failed to appropriately update the Exchanges operating system, and as a result,
    the ATS made thirteen trades at the default position. These trades were circa
    250 times the actual value; in essence, as a result of the failure to appropriately
    update the Exchange operating system, the Respondent came into a windfall and
    received BTC worth circa 250 times what he had paid for them. The Appellant, noting
    the abnormality of these trades, cancelled them. The Respondent consequently claimed
    breach of contract against the Appellant. In the first instance, the Respondent
    was successful with their claim. The Appellant then appealed the judgment, and
    the question of the legal principle of Mistake arose.

    assigned to a physical object, allowing the rights over a portion of that object
    to be dealt with by way of Cryptoasset. An example of this concept is with respect
    to investments, to make such investments more accessible to the public. A painting
    may cost £1,000,000, and a consumer may want to invest in that painting as they
    suspect its value will increase. If that person does not have £1,000,000, they
    are unable to invest in the painting. If however the painting was principally
    split into 16ths and a cryptoasset is created for the sole purpose of attaching
    to the painting, of which only 16 Cryptoassets exist, it is possible that the
    painting can be stored independently. Individuals can purchase 16ths of the painting.
    That person would then have ownership and legal interest in the Cryptoasset and
    beneficial interest in one-sixteenth of the painting; that person can then independently
    sell their 16th interest in the painting to a buyer.

    is often used to be the payment of choice to purchase illicit objects such as
    illegal drugs and firearms. Anyone can track the movement of any particular individual

    is impossible. It isn’t just BTC, but a large amount of cryptoassets created on
    a public blockchain share the same anonymous characteristics as BTC and therefore
    can also be used for the same ends. Further, the price of BTC has encouraged criminals
    to hack into the servers of cryptoasset business and then to transfer all the
    BTC or other cryptoasset held in a wallet, to a wallet held by the criminal. Again,

    their cryptoassets (or tokens) by way of ICO. Information concerning cryptoassets
    was limit at the start of 2018, and if the public knew one thing about them, it
    was that BTC rose from $1,000 to $20,000 in the space of a year. As a result,

    Further, the chapter sets out the applicable laws and challenges the law faces
    when dealing with complex systems and the new digital asset, cryptoassets. It
    is clear that existing legislation is somewhat adequate to deal with cryptoassets
    and smart contracts, as are some principles of law, however, there are circumstances
    which will arise and will likely test the aforementioned legal principles. Until
    more cases are brought to the courts which include arguments determining the characteristics
    of the given cryptoassets in consideration or property law; there is little certainty
    With that said, at the recent statement was issued by the UK Jurisdictional Taskforce
    which sets out the considerations of law and Cryptoassets generally. This statement
    concludes by suggesting that cryptoassets are capable of being property in law.

    likely challenge the existing legal framework and encourage new pieces of legislation
    and regulation to form to deal with these challenges. As cryptoassets are becoming
    increasingly adopted by business, purchased by consumers, those using them will
    want to know that they have a way of enforcing their rights over them as property,
    or to at least know if they have any rights over them at all. Further, consumer
    protection is required to protect those subject to unethical activities.

    consideration, however a challenge that will only be met with the mass adoption
