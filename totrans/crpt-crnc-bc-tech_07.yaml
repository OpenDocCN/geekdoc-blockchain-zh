- en: Cryptoassets have been in existence since circa 2008 when Bitcoin (“BTC”) was
    created. Since then, the law with respect to cryptoassets and smart contracts
    have not been tested as merely not enough consumers and businesses were dealing
    with them; fast-forward to the end of 2017, and the price per 1 BTC was circa
    $20,000.

  zh: 加密资产自大约2008年比特币（“BTC”）创建以来一直存在。从那时起，关于加密资产和智能合约的法律尚未受到考验，因为涉及的消费者和企业数量不足；快进到2017年底，1
    BTC的价格约为20,000美元。
- en: Two years later, at the end of 2019, the cryptoasset market is now testing,
    particularly legal principles due to the volume of business and wealth concerning
    this market. Infrastructure exists to facilitate the storage and trading of cryptoassets;
    further, smart contracts and derivative contracts exist to allow faster transfer
    of wealth and to speculate on the price of any given cryptoasset. Moreover, there
    are hundreds if not thousands of cryptoassets, with more being created each month.
    The cryptoasset market has grown, and it is now at the point where businesses
    and consumers are unsure where they stand with respect to this new asset. In particular,
    what rights these new assets have and further concerns with respect to the business
    activities they are carrying out and the clarity to understand if they are applicable
    to their business. Examples of theft cases, less-than-ethical businesses practices,
    money laundering concerns and consumer protection concerns are all factors which
    have contributed to organisations such as the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”)
    and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) to investigate and provide guidance.
    Furthermore, we are seeing more civil cases enter and proceed through the commercial
    courts of England and Wales, which implies the value of claim any given claimant
    is seeking, is substantial enough for it to warrant issuing a claim with the courts.

  zh: 两年后，即2019年底，加密资产市场正在考验，尤其是与这个市场的业务量和财富相关的法律原则。存在基础设施以促进加密资产的存储和交易；此外，智能合约和衍生合约的存在使得财富转移更快，并对任何给定加密资产的价格进行投机。此外，加密资产的数量可能有数百甚至数千个，每个月都有更多的加密资产被创建。加密资产市场已经增长，现在
    businesses and consumers are unsure where they stand with respect to this new
    asset. 尤其是，这些新资产有什么权利，以及关于它们正在进行的商业活动以及是否适用于他们的业务的清晰度。盗窃案例、道德不端的商业实践、洗钱担忧和消费者保护担忧等因素，都促成了像金融行为监管局（“FCA”）和英国皇家税收海关局（“HMRC”）这样的组织的调查和提供指导。此外，我们越来越多地看到民事案件进入并继续在英格兰和威尔士的商业法院进行，这意味着任何给定原告寻求的索赔价值，足以使其值得向法院提起诉讼。

    hard drive, or a hard drive which the computer running the program is connected
    with, on the Internet; the source of data is from a single hard drive. When a

    software, one can save the document as a file on the hard drive of the computer
    the software is installed. Alternatively, one may wish to save it on a hard drive
    in a data centre, or a “cloud”. Further, one may wish to save the document at
    each of those places. Each place where the file is saved, the file can be amended
    or deleted. One could make an amendment of the cloud file and save it. If one
    wanted to continue working from that document, one would have to access the file
    stored on the cloud, not on the hard drive of the computer. More importantly,
    if the cloud then corrupts, the file is lost. If the type of data storage was
    blockchain based, one would need to ensure that the computer hard drive is part
    of the blockchain network. Once the file is saved on the computer, it will simultaneously
    be saved on all hard drives that are part of that particular blockchain system.
    If the computer was destroyed, the same file would be accessible. Further, another
    party would not be able to delete or amend the document.

- en: Cryptoassets are a strange concept. They are not tangible property which is
    easily identifiable and which we can physically pass to each other. They are not
    intellectual property (“IP”) (although there will inherently be IP in the software
    code which creates cryptoasset through the utilisation to blockchain technology).
    They have been likened to currency; however, the consensus is that it is not currency
    (perhaps currently). Previous chapters in this book will no doubt discuss the
    principles of money in more significant detail and apply them to the current cryptoasset
    landscape. Cryptoassets are a generic name for the existence of a log created
    as a result of the running of a program which utilises the concept of blockchain
    technology. A blockchain program can be designed and used for purposes other than
    creating cryptoassets; however, the characteristics of cryptoassets are likely
    to be contained within the program.

- en: Blockchain technology is a concept applied to the software which creates a ledger.
    Inputting data into the ledger containing numbers creates a ledger of a numerical
    account. If the software enables more than an account to exist and the theoretical
    transfer of numeric data from one account to another, you have two accounts in
    the blockchain transferring numbers. The concept of digital accounts that record
    numbers is not new and is currently used widely by banks. When one signs into
    their online banking, they will see their account with numbers, these numbers
    represent the monetary value which the bank owes you. There will be a ledger of
    sorts behind the figures one sees on a banks database. These numbers can, however,
    be altered manually by one who has access to the software; an account can read
    £100 and then for someone with access to accidentally or purposefully add an addition
    “0” at the end. The account will then have £1,000 within it; this is because these
    numbers are just a log to make sure the bank (and we) know how much they owe us.

- en: Returning to blockchain systems; this ledger is different from typical ledgers
    (such as the ones a bank would typically use) because the data is stored simultaneously
    on blocks. This has the effect that the data within the ledger can not unilaterally
    be manipulated as the software requires each block to agree and confirm any change.
    This creates a system where a finite amount of numbers exist in a ledger (depending
    on how the software is written); this brings a sense of permanence to the numbers.
    These numbers and entries in the ledger are used and called Cryptoassets. Similarly,
    the data in numbers can be replaced by other data, such as word, patents etc.
    and this is the permanence element of blockchain systems.

- en: A contract is a legal agreement in law which is defined by its characteristics
    and requires a particular set of requirements to be fulfilled in order for it
    to be legally binding and enforceable. A contract needs to have an offer; the
    Offer needs to be accepted; consideration needs to pass between parties (each
    party receives something in exchange for something else), and there must be intentions
    to be legally bound. A contract can be defined in writing, spoken, or by way of
    conduct. A smart contract is a contract embedded within a piece of software typically
    implementing blockchain technology. The point of a Smart Contract is to code a
    set of obligations of which can be automatically and autonomously carried out.
    It is possible to do this without the implantation of Blockchain technology, however,
    with the implementation of Blockchain technology, for the reasons set out above,
    the terms of the contract are secure; they can not be amended. Therefore there
    is a sense of assurance and reliability that we have not seen or been able to
    rely on typically. A smart contract, in concept, will usually act like an “escrow
    agent” or the way solicitor’s undertakings work. An escrow agent is typically
    used (outside of England and Wales) in a transaction. In contrast, a set of funds
    are held on behalf of both parties on either side of a transaction; to be paid
    on completion of a contractual obligation. This is typically used when obligations
    are fulfilled in tranches, or the value of the contractual obligation is relatively
    substantial.

    SGCA(I) 02\. In this case, the Appellant (Quoine) was a business operating a cryptoasset
    exchange (the “Exchange”) and would also carry out market-making activities to
    create liquidity. The Respondent (B2C2 Ltd) was a trader on the Exchange using
    an algorithmic trading software (“ATS”), created by the director of the Respondent
    and it worked with little human intervention. The ATS was deterministic in that
    it would always give the same output to the corresponding input; however, a failsafe
    existed whereas if the ATS could not receive data, the default position or fail-safe
    would activate and automatically purchase 10 BTC for 1 ETH. In 2017 the Respondent
    failed to appropriately update the Exchanges operating system, and as a result,
    the ATS made thirteen trades at the default position. These trades were circa
    250 times the actual value; in essence, as a result of the failure to appropriately
    update the Exchange operating system, the Respondent came into a windfall and
    received BTC worth circa 250 times what he had paid for them. The Appellant, noting
    the abnormality of these trades, cancelled them. The Respondent consequently claimed
    breach of contract against the Appellant. In the first instance, the Respondent
    was successful with their claim. The Appellant then appealed the judgment, and
    the question of the legal principle of Mistake arose.

    ETH的价格购买10 BTC。2017年，被上诉人未能适当地更新交易所操作系统，结果ATS以默认位置执行了十三笔交易。这些交易的规模大约是实际价值的250倍；本质上，由于未能适当地更新交易所操作系统，被上诉人意外地获得了价值约250倍的BTC。注意这些交易的异常，上诉人取消了这些交易。被上诉人随后以合同违约对上诉人提起诉讼。在一审中，被上诉人在其诉讼中获胜。上诉人随后对判决提出上诉，出现了错误的法律原则问题。

    painting can be stored independently. Individuals can purchase 16ths of the painting.
    That person would then have ownership and legal interest in the Cryptoasset and
