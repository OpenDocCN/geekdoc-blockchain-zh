    way to look at this. ‘You cannot Blockchain alone’ may sound comical, but it is
    true – a Blockchain network is an ecosystem of interrelated, but separate, parties.
    These could be suppliers, partners, customers, governments, etc., but they are
    all separate entities, which we are using Blockchain technology to connect and
    interact with on a trusted basis.

    technology benefits.

    of new technology, and write the new processes for those.

    development, is to build a solution and then to find a problem, this is the wrong
    way around and something that you should limit. Work with your customers and find
    out what their problems and pain points are – work back from these to develop
    the solution. If the solution uses Blockchain technology great; if it uses other
    technologies, that's great too – you need to find the solutions and use all the
    technologies we have to solve these problems.

    which are not scalable. It was interesting to see, in late 2018, that the main
    Ethereum development company (Consensys) actively began to stop projects in which
    they saw no potential to be a scalable solution. This is important to see, as
    it shows that the technology is maturing from hype to real scalable solutions

    for the end user to complete the process. If you think about the original wallet
