    most likely to be murdered. Its capital, Guatemala City, is one of the world’s
    fifty most violent cities and sits uncomfortably close to even more violent cities
    in El Salvador and Honduras. The murder rates in countries unfortunate enough
    to lie between coca plants in Colombia and drug dealers in the United States are
    the highest in the world; Guatemala’s is tenth highest. Adding to the country’s
    misery is its infant mortality rate, one of the Western Hemisphere’s highest.[¹](notes.html#ch19note-1)
    And for thirty-six years, these were not even Guatemala’s worst misfortunes: its
    civil war, one of the longest-running in the Americas, ended only in 1996.'

    a U.S.-educated engineer and outsized personality, Manuel Ayau, established the
    Center for Economic and Social Studies to promote the thought of the “Austrian
    School” of economics, exemplified by such thinkers as Ludwig von Mises and the
    chemist-philosopher Michael Polanyi. Within a few years, Ayau and other members
    of the center started a university, which they named after Francisco Marroquín,
    a Spanish bishop and contemporary of Martin Luther who spent the second half of
    his life in their country as an advocate for the freedom of Guatemalans.[²](notes.html#ch19note-2)

    and democracy—which dictators and terrorists were trampling just outside the door.
    Freedom, Ayau said, came first of all: “We firmly believe in the capacity of imperfect
    human beings to be better able to realize their destiny when free, and not when
    compelled by the collective entity personified by the state.”'

    humankind will need at all times—may be preserved. What we suggest here is that
    the traditional ivory tower not be abandoned by scholars seeking to join the heated
    discussions of the political arena, but that it be transformed into a new and

    the time, Guatemala’s state-owned telecom company focused on urban areas—and spottily
    at that—in a country where most people lived outside the cities. Guzmán, himself
    a UFM graduate, gathered a team of mainly UFM graduates and professors. In a few
    years, this team’s privatization plan turned a country where rural people had
    to drive miles to stand in line for an expensive urban telephone—one that might
    take ten minutes even to get a dial tone—into the best-connected country in Central
    America. A case study in 2012 reported that “seven years after the reform, the

    bitcoin “bank.” Cointerra died in the bitcoin crash of 2014\. Demeester told of

    the best bitcoin digital “wallets.” Aiming to produce a secure bitcoin wallet,
    in software, it launched a $100,000 funding round in 2013\. The dollars poured
    in, and in an upside surprise, they actually raised $500,000\. They spent $100,000
    on the business plan and stashed $400,000 in bitcoins. The $400,000 soared to
    a bitcoin value of $4 million. Filling their wallet without even writing code,
