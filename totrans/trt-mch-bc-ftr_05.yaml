    firm specializing in Web infrastructure, opened an online sales window. They offered
    only one item for sale that day, and all of twenty-four seconds later, the entire
    stock of one billion was sold out, leaving many potential customers bitter about
    being left out. The object of this ravenous demand? Brave had raised the equivalent
    of $35 million in the initial coin offering, or ICO, of its basic access tokens,

    the first seven and a half months of 2017, almost $1.5 billion flowed into this
    new investment class. Like bitcoin, BATs involved a unique, tradable digital asset
    whose transactions were proven via a public, decentralized blockchain. But, unlike
    bitcoin, these tokens were typically designed for exchanges within a specific
    industry or among a community using a particular Dapp. Most weren’t mined on an
    ongoing basis, either; they were brought into existence through these one-off
    ICOs.

    into Brave’s promise of a token that could fundamentally change the broken online
    advertising industry. Brave took in Ethereum’s ether as the incoming currency
    for the rapid-fire sale, which raised some concerns about heavyweight investors
    muscling less nimble players out of the pool. But it also said something about
    the appeal of Brave’s unique value proposition. It represented the first effort

    and prevent them from reading articles they’ve clicked on knows that the online
    advertising and publishing market is broken. We were promised improved precision,
    better analytics, direct-to-customer marketing, and greater revenue for quality
    content. It’s fair to say each of the three stakeholder segments of the online
    content economy—publishers, advertisers, and users (readers/viewers)—has something
    to complain about. For users, the scourge of banner ads and unsolicited promotional
    videos is not only deteriorating the Web site experience, it is literally costing
    them bandwidth. (By one estimate, $23 a month of people’s mobile phone bill pays
    for ads they don’t want.) For advertisers, “bots” that generate fake traffic data
    have inflated rates for unworthy Web sites—resulting in $7.2 billion in losses
    for the industry in 2016, according to the Association of National Advertisers.
    Meanwhile, plunging CPMs, the standard costs-per-impression measure by which ad
    charge-out rates are set, are hurting mainstream publishers as their sites compete
    with the relentlessly expanding supply of alternative online content from blogs
    and social media. Perhaps inevitably, consumers are turning to ad-blocking software,
    with some 600 million mobile and desktop devices using these services as of early
    2017, a trend that will leave labor-intensive newsrooms starved for the funds
    they need to produce quality journalism.

    economics of this industry. The idea is to create price signals that entice participants

    into certain actions that serve the community’s interest—in its case, creating
    a secure, reliable ledger that all can trust—the programs that run tokens incorporate
    incentives and constraints that encourage certain pro-social behavior. A new concept—token
    economics—is emerging. It encapsulates the idea that we can embed into these “programmable”
    forms of money a way to steer communities toward desired common outcomes. Tokens
    might help us solve the Tragedy of the Commons. In other words, they could be
    a big deal.

    Garrett Hardin. Hardin tells the story of nineteenth-century farmers over-grazing
    the public land they shared because none of them could trust their counterparts
    not to let their livestock eat more than their fair share. It has long been used
    as a cautionary tale about the need for government to regulate access to a public
    resource—in the farmers’ case, land. Ever since then, the “commons” has become
    a catchall for any “space” of public value, tangible or intangible, that needs
    protection. It is why, for example, people talk about free speech and copyright-free
    content on the Internet belonging to a “creative commons” zone that should be
    protected by laws, contractual agreements, and community activism. The issue is
    closely related to the classic economic problem of “externalities”—that capitalism
    can’t easily put a price on the costs that everyone bears when a public resource
    is depleted, such as when a factory pollutes the air.

    a commons, the online content industry has its own misused public resource, one
    that it struggles to put a fair price on: something Brave calls “user attention.”
    Everyone in the publishing and advertising space is competing over access to readers’
    and viewers’ eyeballs so that they can steer them toward content and entice them
    to buy something, whether it’s a newspaper subscription or an advertised product.
    But the industry does a lousy job of identifying and paying for that attention—starting
    with the way it compensates readers and viewers, who provide the resource. In
    theory, we are “paid” for our attention to advertising with access to the news
    and other information that we want to consume—falsely described as “free”—while
    advertisers pay the publishers for the privilege of siphoning off a portion of
    our attention, often against our wishes, toward their product pitches. There’s
    almost something dishonest about it.'

    personal data—part of a new asset class that The Economist described as a twenty-first-century
    resource on par with oil in the previous century. We are giving up this valuable
    new data currency and getting a deteriorating experience in return. Meanwhile,
    publishers and advertisers—unable to accurately measure user attention, let alone
    capture it—are blindly working with meaningless numbers to devise pricing schemes

    have access to. These failures are the underlying reason for the distortions,

    designed to work seamlessly with its tokens. The browser blocks all ads by default
    and, with sophisticated analytics, collates and anonymizes data from users that
    indicate how much time they spend looking at certain content. That way it can
    come up with a useful record of the amount of time we all spend at Internet sites
    without identifying us. As a user of the Brave browser, you are offered the potential
    to earn BATs for selectively turning off the ad blocker to view ads; tokens are
    delivered to an integrated wallet that you uniquely control. You can in turn use
    those tokens to reward publishers of content that you appreciate—in effect, tipping
    them with donations. Meanwhile, to place ads with publishers of content on the
    system, advertisers must first acquire BATs and then pay those tokens to publishers,
    with the price for those ads dictated by the attention metrics associated with
    the latter’s content.

    But the option to tip publishers could send more nuanced, informative signals

    at an ad, and if demand for BATs-priced ads expands, those tokens will rise in
    value as more and more advertisers enter the market, providing a capital gain
    to users. This is a better alignment of results than the current system, built
    as it is on the conceit that we get wanted content for “free” in return for viewing
    ads, when in fact we are giving up both time and large amounts of valuable data

    particular economy impacts human economic behavior by aligning users’ incentives
    with those of the wider community. Fans of the Freakonomics book series will know
    that the study of economics is mostly about incentives—how expected outcomes drive
    us to buy particular items, withhold others, or act in a variety of ways. Too
    often incentives are “misaligned”—as with fund manager bonuses that are tied to
    short-term gains when the investors they serve would be better off with a long-term
    growth strategy. Well, token economics is an attempt to overcome such problems,
    by creating a programmed value effect—essentially, a rising price—that rewards
    people when they act in ways that benefit everyone. In this way, it can re-align

    decentralized computer storage platform Storj, which allows hard-drive-starved
    users to access others’ excess space in exchange for storj tokens. Or there’s

    Mozilla. Over time, he realized that venture capitalists were reluctant to fund
    the marketing cost of acquiring users and that tapping new equity or debt to do
    so was dilutive to the founders’ and early investors’ ownership stakes. “But with
    a token, it can be disbursed to users without credit consequences,” he adds, arguing
    that by contrast to a dollar’s worth of equity or debt, “the BAT is a social credit
    currency; it doesn’t have this inflationary property.”

    distribution successfully encourages network effects of expanding usage, a more-than-offsetting
    rise in token value may also occur. The point is that it’s all on the community—the
    society of BATs users—not on external investors, to bear the risk of that happening.

    itself, the sale by the founders of the platform, that brings into existence these
    particular tokens, which unlike Bitcoin’s general-use status are used only in
    association with the narrow demands of the Dapp with which they are associated.
    In other words, the ICO issuers flow directly to an entity set up and controlled

    the ether price. The ERC20 standard put ether in the sweet spot. Before then,

    also owned ether—a stash they’d either obtained as a reward for Ethereum mining
    or had acquired as an investment or to keep as a store of “fuel” to manage the
    execution of their smart contracts. And ether was skyrocketing. This positive

    2016, when a site called Golem, which offered a platform for trading idle computer
    power (it billed itself as the “Airbnb for computers”), raised $8.6 million in
    half an hour. After that, money seemed to open up for anyone with a white paper
    and a token to sell. An initial high-water mark came in April 2017 when Gnosis,
    whose platform allows users to create prediction markets for betting on just about
    anything, sold 5 percent of the tokens created by the company to raise $12.5 million
    in twelve minutes. With the other 95 percent controlled by the founders, those
    prices meant that the implied valuation of the entire enterprise stood at $300
    million—a figure that soon rose above $1 billion as the Gnosis token promptly
    quadrupled in price in the secondary market. By Silicon Valley standards, it meant
    we had the first ICO “unicorn.” But unlike other highly profitable $1 billion–plus
    unicorns—like Uber and Airbnb—Gnosis hadn’t sold a thing.

    offer high-risk/high-return investment opportunities to a wider group of people

    You can see it in their body language.” When it comes to traditional equity investing,
    venture capital funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and so forth always
    had an advantage on smaller investors, because they’re exempt from regulations
    designed to protect the little guy. VCs are big enough to be designated as “accredited
    investors” by the SEC, so they’re allowed to invest in securities that haven’t
    gone through a public offering process, which would involve a prospectus and a
    host of other disclosures. That privilege has gotten the venture capitalists in

    them one, two percent at most. They realized that VCs get far more in these new
    business models and they are eager to take on similar risks.” Gün Sirer is not
    fazed by the money that some are likely to lose, either. It’s just the risk of
    investing. “They might find sometimes when they really regret the decisions they’ve
    made, but this community also seems quite independent and at home with the consequences

    managers and shareholders—with the latter holding a clear per-dollar vote—and
    a definable source of revenue. The “revenue,” if you can call it that, that block.one
    will generate can be identified as the rising value of its tokens, the gains of
    which will in turn be earned and traded by EOS miners, developers, and users,
    allowing all of them to share in that revenue. In these networked enterprises,
    the lines are blurred between company, owner, investor, manager, employee, and
    customer. So, you could argue that comparisons to traditional equity-based fund-raising

    platform the token is associated with. On the other hand, there’s a clear fund-raising
    intent behind most ICOs, and, to judge from how day traders talk on crypto trading
    sites, many retail investors view these as purely speculative investments that
    they hope will turn a profit. They’re not interested in how they work as tools.
    It remains to be seen whether the prevalence of that mind-set skews the SEC toward
    concluding that many token offerings meet the so-called Howey Test for being a
    security. That test, established in a landmark case of 1946, holds that if a sales

    as a SAFE (Special Agreement for Future Equity), which professional investors
    sometimes enter into with companies yet to issue equity, SAFTs would be sold to
    accredited investors—which must have at least $1 million in liquid net worth and
    more than $200 million in income—assuring the process is legally kosher from day
    one. “The issuers then use the funds they raise to develop the platform’s network,”
    said Cooley’s Santori. “Only then, once the network is functional, and tokens
    are functioning as a real product, can they be sold to the public.” The SAFT gets
    around the risk that the SEC will judge many ICOs to be securities if their tokens
    aren’t yet part of a functioning, decentralized platform. Many investors are clearly
    buying into ICOs in the expectation of profit and are relying on the development
    team’s platform-building work to achieve that, two qualities the SAFT designers
    say mean they will meet the Howey Test criteria and be treated as securities.

    SMTP, for example—those building the protocols of these new decentralized applications

    problems of blockchains will be resolved one way or another, he is convinced that
    open data and middleman-free blockchain-based asset markets will trend toward
    zero transaction costs for cross-trading in all securitized digital assets. He
    plans to deploy into that efficient market setting a network of high-speed, computerized
    trading machines. Much like Wall Street bond traders, these will “make markets”
    to bring financial liquidity to every countervailing pair of tokens—buying some
    here and selling others there—so that if anyone wants to trade 100 BATs for a
    third of a Jackson Pollock, they can be assured of a reasonable market price.

    to make a profit. The machines will transparently make money by trading in and
    out of the market’s natural short-term, up-and-down oscillations, made possible
    by the high efficiency and low transaction costs of a blockchain environment.
    In this vision of a transparent, non-exploitative complex system, “liquidity is
    free,” Olsen says. “In nature, a bee doesn’t have to pay to get nectar. It just

    with Polkadot’s “parachains” idea. A similar interoperability concept could emerge
    from Blockstream’s sidechains project or from the work of MIT Media Lab’s Thaddeus
    Dryja, allowing Lightning Network transactions to cross between different ledgers.
    It turns out that the future may not be one where bitcoin—or the dollar, for that
    matter—is the single, hegemonic currency of the world.

    in which not only Dapps and physical assets are tokenized but also intangible
    concepts such as brands and personal reputations. In fact, this has been happening
    for some time.

    of brand loyalty points. Whereas the points you currently earn buying things from,
    say, your local pharmacy must be used as currency only in that store, Loyyal’s
    tokens are tradable for other tokens or for cash. Why would a merchant allow customers
    a way out of their loyalty commitment? Because, says Peter Reuschel, whose Berlin-based
    Leondrino Exchange creates and trades branded tokens, a token price is a powerful,
    to-the-minute measure of how your brand is doing in the marketplace, one that
    a smart, responsive manager will use as a signal for improvement.

    the embedded value that celebrities carry with them, potentially offering fans
    a chance to own a piece of, say, Roger Federer. But then what about hairdressers
    or lawyers or builders? Might tokens allow all kinds of professionals to monetize
    their talents? Service providers like these—or perhaps, one day, every human being—would
    in effect put their reputations out to a market-based assessment, creating equity
    in themselves.

    ability to feed our kids would hinge on others’ biased judgments of our character.
    Would society become even more vulnerable to the tyranny of the masses, as hordes
    of fans bid up the personal brands of Katy Perry or Justin Bieber while dissing
    everyone else? Still, with the right incentive system embedded into a token’s
    governing algorithm, perhaps we could turn this model into something more valuable,
    a source of market-based discipline to promote accountability. In an age when
    U.S. presidents peddle “alternative facts” and pundits talk openly about our “post-truth
    society,” using the truth machine to put a value on honesty sounds appealing.

    built a decentralized, cryptocurrency-based prediction market on top of Ethereum,
    where players place bets on an outcome of some event or other, the result of which
    depends on confirmation by certain individuals. Those confirming parties will
    bet their rep tokens that they are telling the truth, and if a majority agrees
    that they are, the system returns the tokens and pays them in cash. There’s a
    risk that the majority could game the system against the truth sellers, but there
    are other checks and balances in place to incentivize honesty on both sides. In
    a Wired article about where this idea could go, Cade Metz speculated that it could
    incentivize verifiers with rep-denominated skin in the game to either stand up
    or shoot down the statements of politicians, providing a service that news organizations
    could pay for. If it can actually be built, a system that aligns profit motives
    with truth-telling would be pretty helpful.

    a big idea to tackle it. Miller, a frenetic L.A.-based entrepreneur and venture
    investor, has worked in Hollywood, invested in early dot-coms, and had a vital
    role in developing Snapchat’s highly popular spectacles. Now he wants to “tokenize
    the world” through his investment fund CoinCircle. As part of that, he and his
    partners have come up with a term they call “crypto-impact-economics.”

- en: 'Out of this concept, Miller and a team that includes UCLA finance professor
    Bhagwan Chowdry and World Economic Forum oceans conservationist Gregory Stone
    came up with two special value tokens: the Ocean Health Coin and the Climate Coin.
    Those tokens would be issued to key stakeholders in the global climate problem,
    a mix of companies, governments, consumers, NGOs, and charities, who could use
    them to pay for a range of functions having to do with managing carbon credits
    and achieving emission and pollution reductions. The idea includes a reserve of
    tokens controlled by the World Economic Forum to manage the value of the global
    float of coins. The meat of the proposal involves a plan to irrevocably destroy
    some of the coins in reserve whenever international scientific bodies confirm
    that improvements in pollution and carbon emission targets have occurred. That
    act of destroying tokens, through a cryptographic function, will increase the
    surviving tokens’ scarcity and thus their value. The point: holders are motivated
    to act in the interests of improving the planet now, not tomorrow.'

    it is that it challenges, head-on, the real problem behind our failure to tackle
    climate change: the divisive politics of clashing economic interests. It’s this
    raw power struggle that has made it nearly impossible for coal industry–captured
    governments like the Trump administration to do the right thing for the world.
    So why not bypass government altogether and address the politics via the software-driven
    governance of the money we use?'

    of exchange but a fetishized marker of value that we’re incentivized to accumulate
    in a demonstration of our power, is responsible for the mess that this planet
    is in. Surely we owe it to future generations to redesign that system in a bid
    to save life on earth. The opportunity to do that may come from programmable money—money
    that is not itself an end-goal commodity but rather what it was always meant to
    be, merely a tool for exchanging and collaboratively generating value.

    and the political model that supports it are failing us. We have serious misalignments
    between the incentives for politicians to make laws that favor their corporate
    donors and the interests of the voters they are supposed to represent. The mass-marketed
    idea of retirement as some aspirational endpoint has created an industry of fund
    managers who peel off short-term profits every quarter while no one is properly
    incentivized to address the threats to those same assets that will come once our
    aging societies start driving economic productivity ever lower. These kinds of
    tensions are fueling terrorism, violence, insecurity, and a real risk that, one
    day, this toxic mix of protectionism, nationalism, and xenophobia will put us
    on a path to serious armed conflict.

    in that spirit that we encourage people to reflect on these alternative visions
    for a post-capitalist society, to imagine these technologies as the platform for
    a future that is neither mired in the failed, collectivist ideas of socialism
    nor trapped by the centralized, exclusionary political economy of state-protected,
    big-business monopolies. These ideas offer a way out, but a way that requires
    a change in thinking about how value is created. Rather than framing the exchanges
    that define our life—of labor, assets, and ideas—as a means to acquire a particular
    form of money that’s defined by a symbolic banknote, we should explore new value
    models, whether with tokens or something else, that incentivize collaboration
    for the betterment of all.

    behavior that fosters a self-reinforcing feedback loop of inclusion, efficiency,
    and innovation, it’s possible to build wealth by creating it rather than taking
    it. Designed right, these new economic systems could marshal the forces of the
    market not to incentivize overpaid CEOs to build coal-powered generation plants
    but to make the most efficient use of our resources and those of the planet so
    that we all prosper. In the next chapter, we’ll dig more deeply into how blockchain
    technology offers new ways to reimagine this system.
