    But the revelation didn’t come from Ric.

  zh: 我对数字资产的顿悟来自于与Ric Edelman的一次讨论。但启示并非来自Ric。
- en: 'I was interviewing him at a conference I was hosting for *Barron’s* “Hall of
    Fame” financial advisors. To even get into the room, they had to clear a very
    high bar: 10 years or more as a top-ranked Barron’s advisor. This was not merely
    an elite group; it was the elite of the elite. (And three times, Ric was #1 in
    our rankings.)'

  zh: 我曾在我为*Barron’s*主办的“名人堂”金融顾问大会上采访过他。要想进入这个房间，他们必须越过一道很高的门槛：作为顶级*Barron’s*顾问的资历至少达到10年。这不仅仅是一个精英团体；它是精英中的精英。（而且有三次，Ric在我们的排名中名列第一。）
- en: I wanted to get a sense of the crowd—how rudimentary would we need to get in
    order to give them the information they needed on bitcoin and other digital asset
    investment opportunities? After all, this wasn’t exactly a Silicon Valley tech-bro
    confab. Ric and I were onstage in the elegant ballroom of a 125-year-old hotel
    on the ocean in Palm Beach. The advisors we were addressing were mostly well past
    their 50^(th) birthdays and had spent decades constructing smart, resilient portfolios
    of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets. They warn their clients against chasing
    fads, and while they take calculated risks, they manage money for people who are
    already rich, and who don’t want to have to get rich twice.

  zh: 我想要了解一下人群的情况——我们需要多么基础的知识才能向他们提供有关比特币和其他数字资产投资机会的信息？毕竟，这并不完全是硅谷的科技圈。我和Ric站在帕姆比奇海边一家有125年历史的酒店的优雅舞厅上。我们正在向的顾问们发表讲话，他们大多已经超过了50岁的生日，并且已经花了数十年的时间构建了智能、有韧性的股票、债券和另类资产投资组合。他们警告客户不要追逐时尚，虽然他们会冒险，但他们为已经富裕的人管理资产，并且这些人不想要再次变得富有。
- en: I speak with financial advisors regularly in my role at *Barron’s*, and most
    of them are crypto-skeptics. They’re used to measuring intrinsic value based on
    cash flow and other metrics; all digital assets—even bitcoin and Ethereum—fail
    these tests. Many of the advisors work for companies that won’t let them buy digital
    assets for client accounts even if they want to. About half are “fiduciaries,”
    meaning they are legally bound to put their clients’ interests ahead of their
    own.

  zh: 在我在*Barron’s*的工作中，我经常与金融顾问交流，他们中的大多数人对加密货币持怀疑态度。他们习惯于根据现金流量和其他指标来衡量内在价值；所有数字资产——即使是比特币和以太坊——都无法通过这些测试。许多顾问为不让他们为客户账户购买数字资产而工作的公司效力，即使他们想要购买也不行。大约一半的人是“受托人”，这意味着他们在法律上被要求把客户的利益放在自己的利益之前。
- en: So, there Ric and I were, talking to nearly a hundred of his peers, the nation’s
    most successful financial advisors. I asked them, “How many of you own digital
    assets in your personal accounts?” Well over half of them raised their hands.
    Shocked, I asked, “How many include digital assets in client portfolios?” Again,
    far more than half the hands in the room went up. To get around their firms’ restrictions,
    some of the advisors quietly point clients in the right direction. That could
    not only get them in trouble with their compliance officers, it also could cost
    the advisor—if clients remove funds from their accounts to buy crypto elsewhere,
    that leaves a smaller asset base on which to charge fees. But these advisors had
    decided, to my surprise, that it was in their clients’ best interest to own digital
    assets. So, they were fulfilling their fiduciary duty by helping them do so.

  zh: 所以，我和里克站在那里，与近百位他的同行交谈，这些人是全国最成功的财务顾问。我问他们：“你们个人账户中拥有数字资产的有多少？”超过一半的人举起了手。我震惊地问：“你们将数字资产包含在客户投资组合中的有多少？”房间里超过一半的人都举起了手。为了规避公司的限制，一些顾问悄悄地指导客户朝正确的方向发展。这不仅可能让他们与合规官员惹上麻烦，还可能会损失顾问的利益——如果客户将资金从他们的账户中转移以在其他地方购买加密货币，那么收费基数就会变小。但是令我惊讶的是，这些顾问已经决定，拥有数字资产对他们的客户最有利。因此，他们正在履行着他们的受托责任，帮助客户实现这一目标。
- en: We’ve come a long way since 2018, when John Oliver described cryptocurrencies
    as “everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t
    understand about computers.” Now, a group of fairly conservative, highly sophisticated
    money managers, working with some of the nation’s wealthiest individuals, have
    converted. These men and women did not chase the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble,
    they didn’t hop on the SPAC bandwagon, they hadn’t poured money into Bernie Madoff’s
    scam. But they’ve decided digital assets belong in a well-balanced portfolio.
    They join a long list of establishment types—pension funds, endowments, and even
    a small 401(k) provider—who have embraced digital assets as well.

  zh: 自2018年以来，我们已经走过了很长的路程。当约翰·奥利弗将加密货币描述为“你对金钱一无所知与你对计算机一无所知的结合体”时，现在，一群相当保守、高度复杂的资金管理人员，与一些全国最富有的个人合作，已经转变态度。这些男性和女性并没有追逐[点点com](http://dot.com)泡沫，他们没有跟随SPAC热潮，他们没有将钱投入到伯尼·麦道夫的骗局中。但是他们决定数字资产应该包含在一个良好平衡的投资组合中。他们加入了一长串传统阶层——养老基金、基金会，甚至是一家小型401(k)提供商，他们也纷纷接受了数字资产。
- en: Ric, of course, has been urging all of them to do so for a long time. They are
    probably kicking themselves for not listening to him sooner. I certainly was a
    skeptic. As an editor at *Barron’s*, I first became aware of bitcoin in 2013 when
    it was priced at $31\. I watched as it climbed, and thought of it as the greater
    fool theory at work—you bought bitcoin simply in the hope that someone else would
    pay a higher price. And did they ever; 2,210 times higher by November of 2021\.
    Had I invested a mere $200 back in 2013 and cashed out near the recent high, I
    would have covered one of my children’s college education for the cost of a high-end
    toaster.

  zh: 理查德（Ric）当然长期以来一直在敦促他们这样做。他们可能会因为没有早点听他的话而后悔莫及。我当时确实是个怀疑论者。作为《巴伦周刊》的编辑，我第一次接触比特币是在2013年，当时价格是31美元。我看着它上涨，把它看作是更大的傻瓜理论在起作用——你购买比特币仅仅是希望别人愿意以更高的价格购买。他们确实这样做了；到了2021年11月，价格涨了2210倍。如果我当时只投资了200美元，并在近期高点时退出，我就可以支付一名子女的大学教育费用，这就相当于购买了一台高端烤面包机的成本。
- en: While I haven’t ruled out the possibility that we are witnessing the greater-fool
    theory on steroids, I now think of digital assets as analogous to the internet
    in the ’90s. Sure, there were excesses, but like the internet, I see this new
    technology as a transformational force, changing the future more than most of
    us can imagine. Yes, some of today’s highflyers will become the [Pets.com](http://Pets.com)
    of our era (Dogecoin, anyone?), but as Ric lays out in the pages that follow,
    the utility of blockchain technology is undeniable.

  zh: 虽然我没有排除我们正在见证的是更大的傻瓜理论在大行其道的可能性，但我现在把数字资产看作是类似于90年代的互联网。当然，当时存在过度，但就像互联网一样，我认为这种新技术是一股变革性力量，改变未来超出了我们大多数人的想象。是的，今天的一些热门资产将成为我们时代的[Pets.com](http://Pets.com)（狗狗币，有人想要吗？），但正如Ric在接下来的篇章中所阐述的，区块链技术的实用性是不可否认的。
- en: The ability to tokenize illiquid assets can allow investors to own a share of
    almost anything, or an aging couple to tap the equity of their home without a
    pricey reverse mortgage. Photographers and songwriters and even makeup artists
    will be able to profit from their intellectual property in ways they never could
    have imagined. Ric predicts that the US government will create a stablecoin by
    the end of this decade. Why would the government do that? For one thing, digital
    money will allow governments to track transactions, meaning they can tax them.

  zh: 将非流动资产进行代币化的能力可以让投资者拥有几乎任何东西的股份，或者让一个年迈的夫妇在不付昂贵的逆向抵押贷款的情况下利用他们房屋的资产。摄影师、词曲创作者甚至化妆师都将能够以前所未有的方式从他们的知识产权中获利。Ric预测，美国政府将在本十年结束时创造一个稳定币。政府为什么要这样做呢？首先，数字货币将使政府能够追踪交易，这意味着他们可以对其征税。
- en: So, I am doing my part to educate people, particularly financial advisors. As
    I say to skeptics, it’s not my place to tell advisors how to construct portfolios,
    but I assure them that basic knowledge of digital assets will be a prerequisite
    for a thriving practice. Your clients may not expect bitcoin in their portfolios,
    but their children will.

  zh: 所以，我正在尽我的一份力量教育人们，特别是财务顾问。就像我对怀疑论者说的那样，告诉顾问如何构建投资组合不是我的责任，但我向他们保证，对数字资产的基本了解将成为繁荣实践的先决条件。你的客户可能不期望在他们的投资组合中看到比特币，但他们的孩子会。
