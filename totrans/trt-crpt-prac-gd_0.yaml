    But the revelation didn’t come from Ric.

    Fame” financial advisors. To even get into the room, they had to clear a very
    high bar: 10 years or more as a top-ranked Barron’s advisor. This was not merely
    an elite group; it was the elite of the elite. (And three times, Ric was #1 in
    our rankings.)'

    order to give them the information they needed on bitcoin and other digital asset
    investment opportunities? After all, this wasn’t exactly a Silicon Valley tech-bro
    confab. Ric and I were onstage in the elegant ballroom of a 125-year-old hotel
    on the ocean in Palm Beach. The advisors we were addressing were mostly well past
    their 50^(th) birthdays and had spent decades constructing smart, resilient portfolios
    of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets. They warn their clients against chasing
    fads, and while they take calculated risks, they manage money for people who are
    already rich, and who don’t want to have to get rich twice.

- en: I speak with financial advisors regularly in my role at *Barron’s*, and most
    of them are crypto-skeptics. They’re used to measuring intrinsic value based on
    cash flow and other metrics; all digital assets—even bitcoin and Ethereum—fail
    these tests. Many of the advisors work for companies that won’t let them buy digital
    assets for client accounts even if they want to. About half are “fiduciaries,”
    meaning they are legally bound to put their clients’ interests ahead of their
    own.

- en: So, there Ric and I were, talking to nearly a hundred of his peers, the nation’s
    most successful financial advisors. I asked them, “How many of you own digital
    assets in your personal accounts?” Well over half of them raised their hands.
    Shocked, I asked, “How many include digital assets in client portfolios?” Again,
    far more than half the hands in the room went up. To get around their firms’ restrictions,
    some of the advisors quietly point clients in the right direction. That could
    not only get them in trouble with their compliance officers, it also could cost
    the advisor—if clients remove funds from their accounts to buy crypto elsewhere,
    that leaves a smaller asset base on which to charge fees. But these advisors had
    decided, to my surprise, that it was in their clients’ best interest to own digital
    assets. So, they were fulfilling their fiduciary duty by helping them do so.

- en: We’ve come a long way since 2018, when John Oliver described cryptocurrencies
    as “everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t
    understand about computers.” Now, a group of fairly conservative, highly sophisticated
    money managers, working with some of the nation’s wealthiest individuals, have
    converted. These men and women did not chase the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble,
    they didn’t hop on the SPAC bandwagon, they hadn’t poured money into Bernie Madoff’s
    scam. But they’ve decided digital assets belong in a well-balanced portfolio.
    They join a long list of establishment types—pension funds, endowments, and even
    a small 401(k) provider—who have embraced digital assets as well.

- en: Ric, of course, has been urging all of them to do so for a long time. They are
    probably kicking themselves for not listening to him sooner. I certainly was a
    skeptic. As an editor at *Barron’s*, I first became aware of bitcoin in 2013 when
    it was priced at $31\. I watched as it climbed, and thought of it as the greater
    fool theory at work—you bought bitcoin simply in the hope that someone else would
    pay a higher price. And did they ever; 2,210 times higher by November of 2021\.
    Had I invested a mere $200 back in 2013 and cashed out near the recent high, I
    would have covered one of my children’s college education for the cost of a high-end
    toaster.

- en: While I haven’t ruled out the possibility that we are witnessing the greater-fool
    theory on steroids, I now think of digital assets as analogous to the internet
    in the ’90s. Sure, there were excesses, but like the internet, I see this new
    technology as a transformational force, changing the future more than most of
    us can imagine. Yes, some of today’s highflyers will become the [Pets.com](http://Pets.com)
    of our era (Dogecoin, anyone?), but as Ric lays out in the pages that follow,
    the utility of blockchain technology is undeniable.

    almost anything, or an aging couple to tap the equity of their home without a
    pricey reverse mortgage. Photographers and songwriters and even makeup artists
    will be able to profit from their intellectual property in ways they never could
    have imagined. Ric predicts that the US government will create a stablecoin by
    the end of this decade. Why would the government do that? For one thing, digital
    money will allow governments to track transactions, meaning they can tax them.

    I say to skeptics, it’s not my place to tell advisors how to construct portfolios,
    but I assure them that basic knowledge of digital assets will be a prerequisite
    for a thriving practice. Your clients may not expect bitcoin in their portfolios,
    but their children will.

    now, uttering this sentence: “Damn, I wish I had not learned about that emerging
    technology that was minting billionaires and transforming the world of finance.”'
