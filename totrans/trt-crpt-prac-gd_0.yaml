    But the revelation didn’t come from Ric.

  zh: 我对数字资产的顿悟来自于与Ric Edelman的一次讨论。但启示并非来自Ric。
- en: 'I was interviewing him at a conference I was hosting for *Barron’s* “Hall of
    Fame” financial advisors. To even get into the room, they had to clear a very
    high bar: 10 years or more as a top-ranked Barron’s advisor. This was not merely
    an elite group; it was the elite of the elite. (And three times, Ric was #1 in
    our rankings.)'

  zh: 我曾在我为*Barron’s*主办的“名人堂”金融顾问大会上采访过他。要想进入这个房间，他们必须越过一道很高的门槛：作为顶级*Barron’s*顾问的资历至少达到10年。这不仅仅是一个精英团体；它是精英中的精英。（而且有三次，Ric在我们的排名中名列第一。）
- en: I wanted to get a sense of the crowd—how rudimentary would we need to get in
    order to give them the information they needed on bitcoin and other digital asset
    investment opportunities? After all, this wasn’t exactly a Silicon Valley tech-bro
    confab. Ric and I were onstage in the elegant ballroom of a 125-year-old hotel
    on the ocean in Palm Beach. The advisors we were addressing were mostly well past
    their 50^(th) birthdays and had spent decades constructing smart, resilient portfolios
    of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets. They warn their clients against chasing
    fads, and while they take calculated risks, they manage money for people who are
    already rich, and who don’t want to have to get rich twice.

  zh: 我想要了解一下人群的情况——我们需要多么基础的知识才能向他们提供有关比特币和其他数字资产投资机会的信息？毕竟，这并不完全是硅谷的科技圈。我和Ric站在帕姆比奇海边一家有125年历史的酒店的优雅舞厅上。我们正在向的顾问们发表讲话，他们大多已经超过了50岁的生日，并且已经花了数十年的时间构建了智能、有韧性的股票、债券和另类资产投资组合。他们警告客户不要追逐时尚，虽然他们会冒险，但他们为已经富裕的人管理资产，并且这些人不想要再次变得富有。
- en: I speak with financial advisors regularly in my role at *Barron’s*, and most
    of them are crypto-skeptics. They’re used to measuring intrinsic value based on
    cash flow and other metrics; all digital assets—even bitcoin and Ethereum—fail
    these tests. Many of the advisors work for companies that won’t let them buy digital
    assets for client accounts even if they want to. About half are “fiduciaries,”
    meaning they are legally bound to put their clients’ interests ahead of their
    own.

  zh: 在我在*Barron’s*的工作中，我经常与金融顾问交流，他们中的大多数人对加密货币持怀疑态度。他们习惯于根据现金流量和其他指标来衡量内在价值；所有数字资产——即使是比特币和以太坊——都无法通过这些测试。许多顾问为不让他们为客户账户购买数字资产而工作的公司效力，即使他们想要购买也不行。大约一半的人是“受托人”，这意味着他们在法律上被要求把客户的利益放在自己的利益之前。
- en: So, there Ric and I were, talking to nearly a hundred of his peers, the nation’s
    most successful financial advisors. I asked them, “How many of you own digital
    assets in your personal accounts?” Well over half of them raised their hands.
    Shocked, I asked, “How many include digital assets in client portfolios?” Again,
    far more than half the hands in the room went up. To get around their firms’ restrictions,
    some of the advisors quietly point clients in the right direction. That could
    not only get them in trouble with their compliance officers, it also could cost
    the advisor—if clients remove funds from their accounts to buy crypto elsewhere,
    that leaves a smaller asset base on which to charge fees. But these advisors had
    decided, to my surprise, that it was in their clients’ best interest to own digital
    assets. So, they were fulfilling their fiduciary duty by helping them do so.

- en: We’ve come a long way since 2018, when John Oliver described cryptocurrencies
    as “everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t
    understand about computers.” Now, a group of fairly conservative, highly sophisticated
    money managers, working with some of the nation’s wealthiest individuals, have
    converted. These men and women did not chase the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble,
    they didn’t hop on the SPAC bandwagon, they hadn’t poured money into Bernie Madoff’s
    scam. But they’ve decided digital assets belong in a well-balanced portfolio.
    They join a long list of establishment types—pension funds, endowments, and even
    a small 401(k) provider—who have embraced digital assets as well.

- en: Ric, of course, has been urging all of them to do so for a long time. They are
    probably kicking themselves for not listening to him sooner. I certainly was a
    skeptic. As an editor at *Barron’s*, I first became aware of bitcoin in 2013 when
    it was priced at $31\. I watched as it climbed, and thought of it as the greater
    fool theory at work—you bought bitcoin simply in the hope that someone else would
    pay a higher price. And did they ever; 2,210 times higher by November of 2021\.
    Had I invested a mere $200 back in 2013 and cashed out near the recent high, I
    would have covered one of my children’s college education for the cost of a high-end
    toaster.

- en: While I haven’t ruled out the possibility that we are witnessing the greater-fool
    theory on steroids, I now think of digital assets as analogous to the internet
    in the ’90s. Sure, there were excesses, but like the internet, I see this new
    technology as a transformational force, changing the future more than most of
    us can imagine. Yes, some of today’s highflyers will become the [Pets.com](http://Pets.com)
    of our era (Dogecoin, anyone?), but as Ric lays out in the pages that follow,
    the utility of blockchain technology is undeniable.

    almost anything, or an aging couple to tap the equity of their home without a
    pricey reverse mortgage. Photographers and songwriters and even makeup artists
    will be able to profit from their intellectual property in ways they never could
    have imagined. Ric predicts that the US government will create a stablecoin by
    the end of this decade. Why would the government do that? For one thing, digital
    money will allow governments to track transactions, meaning they can tax them.

- en: So, I am doing my part to educate people, particularly financial advisors. As
    I say to skeptics, it’s not my place to tell advisors how to construct portfolios,
    but I assure them that basic knowledge of digital assets will be a prerequisite
    for a thriving practice. Your clients may not expect bitcoin in their portfolios,
    but their children will.

  zh: 所以，我正在尽我的一份力量教育人们，特别是财务顾问。就像我对怀疑论者说的那样，告诉顾问如何构建投资组合不是我的责任，但我向他们保证，对数字资产的基本了解将成为繁荣实践的先决条件。你的客户可能不期望在他们的投资组合中看到比特币，但他们的孩子会。
