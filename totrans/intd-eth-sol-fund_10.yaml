    New York, USAWhether Ethereum is useful, and indeed groundbreaking, is best evaluated
    in the same terms as other network protocols. It’s been so long since Ted Nelson
    coined the term hypertext in 1965, with his Xanadu project, that it’s easy to
    forget why people liked HTTP and its sibling, HTML. It had exactly one method,
    GET, which would request a page from a web server. The only acceptable response
    was an HTML page.[¹](#Fn1)In many respects, the Ethereum network today is in the
    same stages as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and the Hypertext Markup Language
    back in 1989\. Its existence alone is a boon compared to what came before, so
    much so that the first iteration of the network feels almost like a one-trick
    pony.Subsequent iterations will show that its seemingly sparse specification produces
    immensely sophisticated software. This chapter is dedicated to illustrating the
    kinds of applications that are on the near horizon.

- en: To many cryptocurrency maximalists, the future will be replete with blockchains,
    which will have long since replaced every other technological paradigm. This will
    probably never come to pass—because traditional databases work fine for most things—but
    new interactions will result from these stateful networks that software developers
    and designers may not foresee today. And these interactions will encompass not
    just humans, but also machines working with an unprecedented free will. In the
    future, you may encounter the Ethereum protocol running below the surface in many
    of the everyday technological interactions you make. We’ll talk about how this
    future might develop in the following sections.

    to secure a transaction in good faith. Only after the buyer confirms that the
