    organizations to recognize the threats and opportunities afforded by cryptocurrencies.
    Traditional enterprises, including banks like Barclays, Santander, State Street,
    and Wells Fargo that have been in continuous operation for hundreds of years,
    are among the early explorers of blockchain technologies. Industry consortia like
    R3, founded in 2014, were started to help incumbent enterprises create standards,
    write code bases, and bring blockchain financial services applications to life.
    Over 250 FinTechs have entered the space—such as Axoni, BitPesa, and Digital Asset
    Holdings.^([3](#fn_3)) These enterprises have developed proof-of-concepts (POCs)
    for a dizzying array of financial services: Anti Money Laundering (AML); betting
    & prediction markets; bond issuance; collateral management; compliance reporting;
    commodities pricing; cross-border payments; crowd-funding; currency exchange;
    deal origination; derivatives trading; equities; fixed income; Know Your Customer
    (KYC); mutual funds markets; payments; peer-to-peer lending; purchase orders for
    new securities; settlements; Total Return Swaps (TRS); trade finance; and trade

    applications developed by Ripple, Stellar, WeTrade and Santander (see [Table 4.1](#t_4_1)).
    Interestingly, the first two are examples of global payments applications for
    currency exchanges and remittances. In a way, global payments are the poster child
    of enterprise blockchain applications, enabling peer-to-peer trading; rapid settlement
    times; low transaction costs; guarantee of execution; and heightened security
    for the trade of fiat currencies (in addition to cryptocurrencies) that comply
    with all regulations. We’ll see that **Ripple** and **Stellar** do have native
    digital assets—which grab much of the attention, because both cryptocurrencies
    are typically among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization—but

    global financial system, the sending and receiving parties’ financial institutions,
    national payment systems, and corresponding banks process the transaction. Parties
    to an exchange have no access to the status of the transaction or even which institution
    controls a transaction as it works its way through the system. Fees accumulate
    with each step in the process. Trading partners do not always know the fees in

    Gateway (see [Figure 4.2](#f_4_2)). Gateways can establish trust lines up to certain
    amounts with other gateways. Two gateways that trust each other can transact directly.
    However, if the sending gateway does not have a direct trust line with the receiving
    gateway, the network protocol will find a path of trust, thus transactions will
    ‘ripple’ through the network. One may think of this path as appropriating other
    people’s trust. If Sally wants to send money to Sam without really trusting Sam,
    Sally could send money to someone she trusts, say John; John then sends the money
    to someone he trusts, say Sue; Sue sends the money to Sam, whom she trusts. If
    no path of trust can be found, the value can be transferred using Ripple’s native
    digital asset called ‘Ripple’ (symbol XRP). In this way, XRP can be used as a
    bridge currency if no paths of trust exist between trading partners. The protocol
    searches for the best possible exchange rates and makes the currency exchanges
    in seconds, costing just a few cents worth of fees.^([33](#fn_33))

    As noted above, XRP can be used as a bridge currency if no path of trust can be
    found between trading partners. XRP is also a way to pay gateways, as each may
    establish fees in the form of XRP for using the gateway. If trading partners transact
    directly without using gateways, senders of ripple transactions pay a small amount
    of ripples so that attackers won’t spam the system with millions of transactions,
    as the attackers would run out of XRP.^([37](#fn_37)) Designed to be a scarce
    asset, the XRP money supply is exactly 100 billion ripples and was issued at the
    launch of the protocol, rather than released through the process of mining as
    Bitcoin does.^([38](#fn_38)) Ripple is a deflationary currency—once ripples have
    been used to pay for transactions, they are destroyed. Participants are not required
    to use ripples; they can transact directly with other currencies.^([39](#fn_39))

  zh: 被称为“ripples”的Ripple原生加密货币（XRP）有几个用途。正如上面提到的，如果没有在交易伙伴之间找到信任路径，XRP可以用作桥接货币。XRP也是支付网关的方式，因为每个网关都可以通过XRP形式设定费用。如果交易伙伴之间直接交易而不使用网关，ripple交易的发送者支付少量ripples，这样攻击者就不会用数百万交易来淹没系统，因为攻击者会耗尽XRP。^([37](#fn_37))作为一种稀缺资产，XRP的货币供应量恰好是1000亿ripples，并且是在协议启动时发行的，而不是像比特币那样通过挖矿过程释放。^([38](#fn_38))Ripple是一种通货紧缩货币——一旦ripples被用来支付交易，它们就会被销毁。参与者不必使用ripples；他们可以直接使用其他货币进行交易。^([39](#fn_39))

    lumens are used to fund the operations of the SDF. Stellar released 100 billion
    lumens in 2014, retaining five percent for the foundation to operate, and holding
    the rest in reserve. XLM is an inflationary currency—new lumens are added to the
    network at the rate of one percent of the money supply each year.^([79](#fn_79))
    The foundation aimed to distribute lumens to a broad range of individuals and
    organizations, including 50 percent to individuals; 25 percent for non-profits
    aiming to reach underserved populations; and 20 percent to bitcoin holders.^([80](#fn_80))
    To reach individuals, the foundation releases lumens for auctions on exchanges
    like Kraken. People and institutions may also apply to the SDF for lumens to fund
    projects. In order to provide additional stability to the system, employees of
    the foundation are not allowed to buy lumens at auctions, and Stellar’s owners
    agreed not sell any of the lumens for at least five years.^([81](#fn_81))^,^([82](#fn_82))
    In November of 2019, the SDF decided to burn 50 billion lumen that were in reserve
    because it was having a hard time getting them distributed into the market.^([83](#fn_83))

- en: 'While still a consortium, WeTrade brought in IBM because it wanted to build
    a platform that would not only work for the initial participating banks, but for
    hundreds of banks.^([100](#fn_100)) WeTrade is built on the IBM Blockchain Platform
    using HyperLedger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain. Each bank operates a node.
    Functionally, WeTrade helps customers to find trusted trade partners, request
    financing, automate and secure payment, and track the trade journey end-to-end.
    The participating banks verify the buyers and sellers. A typical process works
    as follows: Alice, the seller, wants to sell goods to Bob, the buyer. Provided
    that Alice’s and Bob’s banks are licensed to use WeTrade, they can use the platform
    to facilitate the trade. Alice logs in to WeTrade through her bank’s portal, creates
    a trade proposal for Bob that specifies terms and conditions, such as payment
    schedules. Bob gets pinged to review the proposal. If Bob agrees, Bob’s bank then
    reviews the proposal. If Bob’s bank agrees, the smart contract is launched. All
    parties privy to the contract can observe the paper trail of the trade. Once Bob
    signals receipt of the goods, Bob’s bank automatically pays Alice. [Figure 4.8](#f_4_8)

  zh: 在还是一个财团的时候，WeTrade引入了IBM，因为它希望建立一个不仅适用于最初的参与银行，而是适用于数百银行的平台。^([100](#fn_100))WeTrade是基于IBM区块链平台，使用HyperLedger
    Fabric这一受许可的区块链构建的。每个银行运营一个节点。功能上，WeTrade帮助客户寻找可靠的贸易伙伴，请求融资，自动化并保障支付，以及端到端跟踪贸易旅程。参与银行验证买家和卖家。一个典型的流程如下进行：作为卖家的Alice想向买家Bob出售商品。假设Alice和Bob的银行被授权使用WeTrade，他们可以使用该平台促进交易。Alice通过自己银行的门户登录WeTrade，为Bob创建一个指定条款和条件的交易提案，比如支付计划。Bob收到通知以审查该提案。如果Bob同意，Bob的银行然后审查提案。如果Bob的银行同意，智能合约被启动。所有参与合同的各方可以观察到交易的纸质记录。一旦Bob表示收到货物，Bob的银行会自动支付给Alice。图4.8提供了产品概述。

    and Santander Securities served as the *custodian* bank.^([132](#fn_132)) Based
    on legal advice from the global law firm Allen & Overy, Santander issued the digital
    bond under English law because English law requires a register of record, but
    it does not specify the type of register.^([133](#fn_133)) Under English law,
    a register of record could be a piece of paper, a spreadsheet, a central securities
    depository, or, yes, even a blockchain. (Santander could not use Spanish law because
    it requires that the register of record is a central securities depository.)

    the challenges. Supply chain partners often have an easier time deploying blockchain
    solutions compared to financial services because many supply chain solutions track
    items, not money (yet). The compliance burden is therefore less onerous. In [Chapter
    3](chapter03.xhtml), we’ve already introduced the IBM Food Trust, TradeLens, MediLedger,
    and WineChain as supply chain examples. In this chapter, we’ll dig deeper into
    the IBM Food Trust and explore other live blockchain solutions for food, diamonds,
    and parts (see [Table 5.1](#t_5_1)).

- en: The food supply chain has been particularly challenging to coordinate because
    of its scale. The global food and grocery retail market will exceed $12 trillion
    in 2020.^([3](#fn_3)) While much of the world’s food supply is safe, there is
    significant room for improvement. The World Health Organization reports that 600
    million people get food poisoning, and 420,000 die, each year from consuming contaminated
    foods.^([4](#fn_4)) Besides food contamination, the world food supply suffers
    significant amounts of food waste, food mislabeling, and food fraud, such as claiming
    horsemeat as lamb and claiming non-organically grown vegetables as organic.^([5](#fn_5))
    Human rights and environmental problems, such as slave labor and unauthorized
    use of pesticides, remain grave concerns. For example, the International Labor
    Organization estimates that 3.5 million people are forced to work in agriculture,
    fishing, and forestry.^([6](#fn_6)) Each country has its share of food safety
    challenges, but here we focus on the US and China as the largest food producers
    and consumers.

    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 48 million Americans get
    sick from food; 128,000 Americans are hospitalized; and 3,000 die of foodborne
    diseases, each year.^([8](#fn_8)) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) had
    61 active food recalls in January 2020, primarily for beef; pork; poultry; seafood;
    and salads. For example, The Pride of Florida recalled nearly 70,000 pounds of
    raw beef products that may be contaminated with *E. coli*. Other recalls were
    prompted by mislabeling, some by circumventing import inspections, some by misbranding,
    and some because of undeclared allergens.

- en: China’s food market is worth $527 billion, of which meat products are the largest
    segment.^([11](#fn_11)) China has had a number of food safety crises. For example,
    in 2008, milk and infant formula were adulterated with a toxic substance (melamine)
    to boost the protein content that causes bladder and kidney stones, resulting
    in 300,000 infant illnesses and 54,000 hospitalizations.^([12](#fn_12)) In 2013,
    some local Chinese pork dealers lifted 15,000 dead pigs from a river, processed
    and sold them.^([13](#fn_13)) In 2020, Chinese fishmongers continued to add diesel
    fuel to dying fish to make them thrash.^([14](#fn_14)) Beyond these headlines,
    the use of pesticides, dangerous chemical additives, and unsanitary conditions
    remain challenges. To help improve food safety, the Chinese government consolidated
    food safety regulation with the creation of the State Food and Drug Administration
    of China (SFDA) in 2003\. However, in 2007, the head of the CFDA was executed
    for taking bribes. Today, about ten government departments and ministries are
    responsible for food safety, including the Ministry of Health; the State Food
    and Drug Administration; the Ministry of Agriculture; the State Administration
    for Industry and Commerce; the General Administration of Quality Supervision;
    Inspection and Quarantine; the Ministry of Commerce; the Ministry of Science and
    Technology; and the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety.^([15](#fn_15))

- en: All stakeholders, including farmers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, consumers,
    government, and academics need to be involved in food safety. While there is no
    single-pronged solution, sharing information across supply change partners is
    an important part of any food safety solution. As we have pointed out many times,
    without a blockchain solution, every party in the food supply chain manages its
    own systems of records (software and data) within the boundaries of the firm or
    relies on a trusted-third party to manage their systems on their behalf. Each
    party can only see data coming in and out of their own systems, which is why is
    can take weeks to trace a food recall from a retail store back to the originating
    farm or fishery. Improving food safety requires much better tracking of information
    as food passes through the entire supply chain; known as ‘farm to fork’ and ‘bait
    to plate’ traceability. Blockchain-enabled solutions offer the ability to share
    data with ecosystem partners in a secure way. In the food industry, a number of
    blockchain-based solutions have been developed. We’ll begin with the most well-established
    solution.

    retailer which earned $514 billion in revenue in 2019—began conducting food traceability
    pilot programs for mangos and pork back in 2016\. The solution, based on HyperLedger
    Fabric, reduced traceability for mangos from seven days to under three seconds.^([16](#fn_16))
    In 2017, other supply chain partners joined the network, including Dole, McCormack,
    McLane, Driscoll’s, Unilever, Golden State Foods, Nestle, and Kroger. As of 2020,
    250 members had joined.

    Freshly caught fish are tagged with an RFID device and registered on the blockchain.
    The Global Positioning System (GPS) is linked to the RFID tag, so every time the
    fish is scanned, the event is captured in the blockchain to trace its journey
    (see [Figure 5.3](#f_5_3)). When the fish is processed, data from the tag creates

    incorporated in Delaware, with its head office in East Aurora, New York. VeriTX’s
    mission is to enable the fourth modality of logistics, which Regenor calls digital,
    following the first three modalities of land, sea, and air. The company built
    a business-to-business platform for the buying and selling of digital assets (like
    printing specs) and physical assets, powered by blockchain technology. The platform
    has been built and tested with many POCs with global strategic partners, and it
    will launch into production in 2020\. The 2020 timeline is possible because VeriTX
    actually has a longer history dating back to when Colonel Regenor joined Moog
    in 2013 after retiring from 31 years of military service in the US Air Force.
    The VeriTX journey begins thereafter with Moog’s acquisition of a 3D print business
    in Detroit, Michigan, in Nov 2015.

    users would need a way to guarantee that the part that came off the printer was
    authentic and that the part was ready for use. Furthermore, the newly printed
    part would need to be tracked over its entire lifetime, so it would need an embedded

    because the pathway for certification of 3-D printed aerospace parts is still

    technologies to uniquely identify traditionally manufactured parts. Moog did a
    POC with Alitheon, a company that uses simple mobile phone cameras and proprietary
    software to transform 54,000 unique surface characteristics of individual objects
    into a unique digital ID—no tags are appended, the object serves as its own identifier!

    the software authenticates the object and provides a match confidence score^.^([41](#fn_41))
    For the POC, Moog sent 20 metal parts to Alitheon for scanning, which Alitheon
    then sent back to Moog. Moog scanned them upon receipt, matched them with Moog’s
    ID, and then brutalized the materials by dropping them on concrete floors, grinding
    them with handheld motors, and grit blasting the parts. Moog sent these worn parts
    back to Alitheon, which was still able to identify the unique parts, even when

    customers in an ecosystem enabled by blockchain? To attract customers to the platform,
    Regenor foresaw following Apple’s strategy when it launched iTunes. Apple initially
    offered a seed catalogue of music to attract customers, then updated the catalogue
    each week to keep customers coming back. Similarly, Regenor planned to seed the
    digital catalogue for general properties of 3-D printed materials. This catalogue
    would allow customers to move from ‘point approvals’ to ‘design allowables’. Customers
    will initially go to the platform to access the digital catalogue, but as the
    ecosystem grows, other parties will be able to offer more services on top of the
    platform.'

    least five equal partners (of which Moog would be one) to manage the platform
    and a separate consortium would govern each industry vertical. Regenor planned
    to first build the platform for the aerospace industry, and then expand to automotive,
    medical and other industries that use 3-D printed parts.

    energies generates about $90 trillion each year.^([3](#fn_3)) While energy literally
    powers our lives, the industry stresses our natural resources. By their very nature,
    energy problems are global problems, requiring many partners across firm and country
    boundaries to cooperate. Blockchain technologies are well suited to transform
    the generation, distribution and consumption of energy. The World Economic Forum,
    in collaboration with PwC and Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, reported
    blockchain-based solutions were being developed to address: climate change; biodiversity
    and conservation; healthy oceans; water security; clean air; and weather and disaster

    over, large electric utilities are the primary suppliers of electricity. These
    large, centrally-managed organizations have been operating with the same business
    models for 100 years or more and they are markedly energy inefficient. According
    to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, only 32 percent of electric energy
    generated in the US is actually ‘useable energy’, called ‘exergy’.^([6](#fn_6))
    That means most of the electric energy generated by utilities is wasted through
    the processes of conversion, transportation and consumption.^([7](#fn_7))

    more than 2 million US households and commercial properties had solar power by
    2019.^([8](#fn_8))^,^([9](#fn_9))

    upon, their major electric utility providers. Any excess capacity generated from
    a household solar panel is put right back into the traditional electric grid and
    the utility provider credits the consumer’s bill; the ‘prosumers’ – households
    that produce excess energy – have no market to sell excess capacity to besides
    the utility provider. That is, until now. Lawrence Orsini, founder and CEO of
    **LO3 Energy**, aimed to create a way for neighbors to buy and sell excess electric
    capacity directly from each other. His company, along with partners, built a technology
    platform to create peer-to-peer markets for the sharing economy (see [Table 6.1](#t_6_1)).

    in 2012 in Brooklyn New York. He worked for PECI, a non-profit based in Portland
    Oregon that helps utilities, governments and other clients to become more energy
    efficient.^([15](#fn_15)) He was also Director of New Products at CLEAResults,
    an Austin Texas-based company that helps utilities, businesses, and consumers

    local, reliable, efficient, and self-governing. He wanted to build the platform
    where prosumers sell excess energy capacity from their solar panels directly to
    neighbors using a mobile app. His idea became even more pertinent in the aftermath
    of Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York City in October of 2012\. It was the largest
    hurricane on record at the time—a whopping 1,100 miles in diameter. As Hurricane
    Sandy flooded the streets of New York City, power went out to over 800,000 residences
    and businesses and stayed off for days.^([17](#fn_17)) Even residents with solar
    panels could not use their own power because the photovoltaic panels (PV) that
    connected them to the utility grid were shut off. The pain and aftermath of Hurricane
    Sandy awakened consumers and made them receptive to LO3 Energy’s value proposition.

    million in two funding rounds. Centrica; Braemar Energy Ventures; Siemens; Sumitomo
    Corporation; and Shell Ventures are investors.^([18](#fn_18)) LO3 Energy has been
    lauded with numerous awards, such as the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) Pioneers
    Winner in 2018 and the Global Corporate Venturing’s Digital Energy Investment
    of the Year in 2019.^([19](#fn_19)) LO3 has been featured by CNN, Forbes, Reuters,
    and many more outlets.^([20](#fn_20)) The technology is ready. Consumers are ready.
    However, widespread commercialization needs more regulators and existing utilities
    to embrace disruption, which has been slow to come. First, we look at LO3’s technology
    and then we explore its first major pilot, called the Brooklyn Microgrid.

- en: To accomplish Orsini’s vision, LO3 Energy built both the hardware and software,
    with partners, to create what is called a ‘transactive energy platform’ they branded
    as ‘Exergy’ (see [Figure 6.1](#f_6_1)). The platform comprises hardware such as
    smart meters, switches, and controllers. The software is based on a proprietary
    blockchain-based application with a customizable, mobile user interface.

    and consumption of electricity (See [Figure 6.2](#f_6_2) for sample hardware).
    The hardware feeds data to the blockchain-based application every second. Only
    the prosumers need the specialized hardware installed; consumers interact with
    the platform through a mobile or desktop app. LO3 is working with Siemens to build
    the physical grid that will separate from the main utility grid so that locally-generated
    power can be re-routed to critical locations in time of need.^([21](#fn_21)) Most
    importantly, Exergy’s hardware is ‘device agnostic’ so that other suppliers can
    operate Exergy-compliant hardware.^([22](#fn_22))

    also needed to show that its platform could attract other partners, particularly
    incumbent utilities, to build new business models on top of it.

    Some of these projects have continued to progress, such as PowerLedger, which
    had 23 projects in eight countries in 2020.^([47](#fn_47)) Other projects, however,
    have already succumbed to what Orsini calls ‘the valley of death’. He argued that
    many startups had confused the market with ‘blockchain-first’ strategies that
    ultimately failed. In contrast, LO3 Energy intends to overcome the ‘valley of
    death’ because Exergy was developed as an ‘energy-first’ solution. Orsini said:'

    create or collaborate with start-ups to bring new energy solutions based on ‘ethical
    machines’ to market.^([50](#fn_50)) One of its projects is ‘Share&Charge’, a startup
    venture to create a peer-to-peer marketplace for electric car charging. Innogy
    wanted to expand Germany’s infrastructure by enabling 60,000 private charging
    stations to join Germany’s 6,500 public charging stations.

    own flat rate, time-based, or kilowatt hour-based fees. The fees can also be discounted
    for family, friends, or charities. Using a mobile app, drivers can search for
    nearby charging stations, charge their electric cars at any of the authorized
    stations and pay for the charges using Share&Charge’s native digital asset, an
    ERC20 token, initially called a ‘Mobility Token’.^([51](#fn_51))

    in 2017 (see [Figure 6.8](#f_6_8)).^([52](#fn_52)) The initial application was
    built on the public Ethereum using three smart contracts: MobilityToken^([53](#fn_53)),
    ChargingPoles^([54](#fn_54)), and LibManager^([55](#fn_55)). MobilityToken was
    the token contract that held balances and enforced rules; each token was backed
    by a real Euro and complied with German regulations. ChargingPoles registered
    all of the charging pole stations and executed the operations at the charging
    stations, such as the start and stop meter functions. LibManager was a library
    of contracts that allowed Share&Charge to update smart contracts or fix programming
    errors.^([56](#fn_56)) Since this initial application, Share&Charge has launched
    its own blockchain network, called the Open Charging Network (OCN). Energy Web
    Chain (EWC), which is based on Ethereum, uses a Proof-of-Authority consensus protocol.
    EWC is open source.^([57](#fn_57)) As of 2019, the OCN is open for public testing.'

    Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.^([59](#fn_59)) Also in 2018, Share&Charge
    launched a nonprofit foundation to help further develop the Open Charging Network.
    Share&Charge tested an in-car wallet in 2019 in a Toyota.^([60](#fn_60)) The app

- en: LO3 Energy and Share&Charge are two powerful ‘Internet of Value’ examples for
    the energy sector. They are each providing a peer-to-peer platform to empower
    everyday prosumers and consumers to share their energy resources. Their adoption
    journeys are similar in that each launched a POC on public Ethereum that expanded
    consumer awareness. Their founders simultaneously built network effects by uniting
    with partners across country borders, worked with regulators, and built a more
    robust platform based on a faster and more scalable consensus mechanism than Ethereum’s
    proof-of-work. In the next chapter, we explore the challenges of credentialing
    and an application solution called SmartResume.

    that are marching us towards an ‘Internet of Value’. However, as of 2020, the
    current state of blockchains is still missing universal components to realize
    the full vision. We are still missing the full power of individual self-sovereignty
    over our own identities and credentials and a truly user-friendly experience across
    blockchain platforms. Many organizations, consortia, and standards-making bodies
    are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and interoperability. In the future,
    individuals, organizations, and objects will be able to declare seamlessly their
    identities and credentials to any other individuals, organizations, or objects
    that require verification across blockchain solutions.

    and Instagram (35 percent).^([6](#fn_6)) While such solutions do have the advantages
    of convenience and scale, they equally frustrate job seekers and recruiters. Distrust
    happens on both sides of the market. Specifically, recruiters doubt applicants’
    self-reported credentials and skills, while job seekers distrust that hiring companies

    Consequently, hiring companies spend significant resources to investigate a job
    candidate’s claims. Verification slows down the process and increases costs. On

    Some large companies have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to modernize
    recruitment, but so far results did little to reduce biases. For example, Amazon’s
    AI recruiting tool was designed to search for keywords based on past engineering
    candidates’ resumes. Since most engineers were male in the past, the AI tool learned
    to prefer male applicants. Amazon abandoned the tool after the gender bias was
    revealed.^([12](#fn_12)) Social media, job site platforms, and AI tools are not
    the only sources of selection bias; relying on referrals from current employees
    creates a homogeneous applicant pool because people tend to refer people who are

    certifiers—such as organizations that train and certify truck drivers; steamfitters,

    personal SmartResume with additional information, such as career objectives, hobbies,
    and interests. Hiring organizations can ascertain which credentials were verified
    by credentialing organizations by the presence of the blockchain badge and which
    entries were added by individuals. Each individual gets one SmartResume, which
    may contain verified credentials from many different organizations. Individuals
    are in control of their job matching preferences and may grant or deny full access
    rights to particular hiring organizations. Individuals do not have to pay to participate

    of the features for which blockchain technologies and traditional technologies
    are best suited. Blockchain technology was selected to create a tamper-proof audit
    trail of verified credentials in a multi-party environment. Traditional databases
    were selected for high performance and scalability processes, such as searching
    for jobs and job candidates, enhancing SmartResumes with supplemental information,
    mapping credentials to Standard Occupation Codes, and protecting personal information.

- en: The first time Dave Wengel searched for “certified digital resumes”, back in
    2017, he was shocked to find zero results. Why hadn’t anyone built a multi-credentialed
    resume? Wengel thinks it’s because *“there’s no value if you do not have a consortium.”*
    He began to envision the solution and, based on his company’s experiences, he
    knew building a consortium would be the key to success.
  id: totrans-751

- en: iDatafy’s first product was ***LeadReview*®**, a proprietary data consortium
    used to detect bad marketing leads. The solution was launched at the end of 2011
    and has since processed more than 100 million queries. The company’s second data
    consortium, ***StudentReview*®**, was developed in 2012 to detect student financial
    aid fraud in the US. The context was very similar to the job acquisition process
    in that the market for financial aid was subject to deception and mistrust. Many
    individuals with no intention of attending college were signing up for US Federal
    government financial student aid (called ‘Pell grants’) and would drop out immediately
    after receiving the money, enroll elsewhere, and repeat the deceit. In some cases,
    criminals organized into rings that recruited ‘straw students’ by promising them
    a share of the grant money. By 2011, criminals were swindling billions of dollars
    each year from the US federal government. iDatafy researched the problem and discovered
    that the individuals re-used the same contact information (like home addresses)
    to receive the checks. iDatafy created a consortium of higher education institutions
    to build and share a FERPA-compliant directory data about the students who habitually
    drop out and try to enroll in multiple schools. The StudentReview platform automatically
    analyzes the data and flags instances where contact information is duplicated.
    The system alerts colleges and universities when a new applicant has dropped out
    of other schools after receiving financial aid.^([22](#fn_22))

    to build an ecosystem solution. To build a successful consortium, iDatafy developed
    a three-phased process called ‘**crawl, walk, run**’. We illustrate the process
    with the SmartResume consortium.

    chair of the information systems department (ISYS); and the associate vice provost
    from the registrar’s office. While most of the leaders were supportive of the
    idea, they were initially concerned about adding another major IT project given
    the campus was in the middle of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement.
    They did not want to build an interface to pull student records from a system
    that was about to be replaced. Wengel listened to the feedback and suggested a
    pilot with 20 students so that it would add very little to the university’s workload.
    iDatafy would do the heavy lifting.

    Also in fall, small SmartResume pilot programs began. The Walton College recruited
    10 ISYS students and 10 ISYS alumni to volunteer to be the first individuals to
    receive smart resumes. The university registrar launched the volunteers’ SmartResumes
    on the platform by verifying credentials, doing so manually, one student at a
    time. The volunteers then activated their SmartResumes and provided iDatafy with
    feedback. iDatafy learned that there were many more skills and activities that
    should be certified in addition to degree programs, including the aforementioned
    Leadership Walton. Dean Waller agreed to manually verify Leadership Walton participation
    and other non-transcript accomplishments to appear on the students’ SmartResumes.

    hiring organizations that recruit on many campuses wondered if there was a better
    way to find talent given that universities award similar degree programs, but
    name them differently. For instance, an information systems degree at one school
    might be called Computer Information Systems; Management Information Systems;
    Information Technology; Business Information Technology; Business Computing; or
    Information Systems Engineering at other schools. iDatafy responded by creating
    a map of a certifier’s credentials to the Standard Occupational Codes (SOCs) created

    of Arkansas System public institutions of higher learning. Companies that recruit
    Arkansas talent also began showing interest in the consortium. One non-profit

    universities to issue a diploma on a blockchain. In 2017, 111 students were given
    a Blockcerts Wallet app with access to a verified, tamper-proof digital diploma
    with its hash stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.^([25](#fn_25)) One of the major
    lessons from the experiment was that users found it difficult to manage their
    own private keys.^([26](#fn_26)) To scale the app for live production, MIT engaged
    the vendor, Learning Machine. As of 2020, all recent MIT graduates receive a digital
    diploma in addition to a physical diploma. Students opt in to activate the digital
    diploma by clicking on an official MIT invitation email sent to all recent graduates.
    Students download the Blockcerts mobile app and add MIT as an issuer. The app
    generates a unique public key, which users can share with hiring organizations.
    Hiring organizations use the public key to verify credentials on the web portal,
    [https://credentials.mit.edu/](https://credentials.mit.edu/). The service is free.^([27](#fn_27))

    institution, namely MIT. If everyone adopted this model, users would be given
    multiple public keys and hiring organizations would need to go to multiple portals
    to verify a single candidate. For this reason, **Blockcerts** has continued to
    build an open source community (MIT is not actively involved) where a user may
    have multiple issuers. The Blockcerts community has developed versions that run
    Ethereum, Sovrin and Hyperledger.^([29](#fn_29)) The software is published under
    MIT Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) license. Institutions that have built
    their own credentialing solutions using the open source software include McMaster
    Engineering in Canada, Georgia Tech in the US, and Universidad Carlos III in Madrid.
    Rather than build a solution, institutions can also hire companies like Learning
    Machine, which continues to help institutions implement Blockcerts.^([30](#fn_30))
    Customers include the Southern New Hampshire University, Republic of Malta, Federation
    of State Medical Boards (FSMB), and National Training Agency’s (NTA) Workforce
    Preparedness Program in the Bahamas. Blockcerts is planning to add photo IDs and
