    applications developed by Ripple, Stellar, WeTrade and Santander (see [Table 4.1](#t_4_1)).
    Interestingly, the first two are examples of global payments applications for
    currency exchanges and remittances. In a way, global payments are the poster child
    of enterprise blockchain applications, enabling peer-to-peer trading; rapid settlement
    times; low transaction costs; guarantee of execution; and heightened security
    for the trade of fiat currencies (in addition to cryptocurrencies) that comply
    with all regulations. We’ll see that **Ripple** and **Stellar** do have native

    borders each year.^([5](#fn_5)) Third-party intermediaries collect about $2.2
    trillion in revenue to facilitate these transactions. Money may move around the
    world in several ways using a variety of services, but we’ll focus on a simplified
    version of the process. In today’s global financial systems, each country has
    its own national payment system and uses its own sovereign currency.^([6](#fn_6))
    A bank must be licensed to use its country’s national payment system. International
    transactions often rely on the cooperation between banks in different countries,
    creating a messy web of correspondent bank relationships (see [Figure 4.1](#f_4_1)
    for a simplified depiction).^([7](#fn_7)) With a cross-border payment in today’s
    global financial system, the sending and receiving parties’ financial institutions,
    national payment systems, and corresponding banks process the transaction. Parties
    to an exchange have no access to the status of the transaction or even which institution
    controls a transaction as it works its way through the system. Fees accumulate
    with each step in the process. Trading partners do not always know the fees in
    advance, which can become quite substantial. Sending remittances cost an average
    of 7.99 percent of the amount sent, and takes several business days to settle.^([8](#fn_8))^,^([9](#fn_9))

    Gateway (see [Figure 4.2](#f_4_2)). Gateways can establish trust lines up to certain
    amounts with other gateways. Two gateways that trust each other can transact directly.
    However, if the sending gateway does not have a direct trust line with the receiving
    gateway, the network protocol will find a path of trust, thus transactions will
    ‘ripple’ through the network. One may think of this path as appropriating other
    people’s trust. If Sally wants to send money to Sam without really trusting Sam,
    Sally could send money to someone she trusts, say John; John then sends the money
    to someone he trusts, say Sue; Sue sends the money to Sam, whom she trusts. If
    no path of trust can be found, the value can be transferred using Ripple’s native
    digital asset called ‘Ripple’ (symbol XRP). In this way, XRP can be used as a
    bridge currency if no paths of trust exist between trading partners. The protocol
    searches for the best possible exchange rates and makes the currency exchanges
    in seconds, costing just a few cents worth of fees.^([33](#fn_33))

    As noted above, XRP can be used as a bridge currency if no path of trust can be

    establish fees in the form of XRP for using the gateway. If trading partners transact
    directly without using gateways, senders of ripple transactions pay a small amount
    of ripples so that attackers won’t spam the system with millions of transactions,
    as the attackers would run out of XRP.^([37](#fn_37)) Designed to be a scarce
    asset, the XRP money supply is exactly 100 billion ripples and was issued at the
    launch of the protocol, rather than released through the process of mining as
    Bitcoin does.^([38](#fn_38)) Ripple is a deflationary currency—once ripples have

    institutions or individuals any fees to use the Stellar network, beyond the modest

    lumens are used to fund the operations of the SDF. Stellar released 100 billion
    lumens in 2014, retaining five percent for the foundation to operate, and holding
    the rest in reserve. XLM is an inflationary currency—new lumens are added to the
    network at the rate of one percent of the money supply each year.^([79](#fn_79))
    The foundation aimed to distribute lumens to a broad range of individuals and
    organizations, including 50 percent to individuals; 25 percent for non-profits
    aiming to reach underserved populations; and 20 percent to bitcoin holders.^([80](#fn_80))
    To reach individuals, the foundation releases lumens for auctions on exchanges
    like Kraken. People and institutions may also apply to the SDF for lumens to fund
    projects. In order to provide additional stability to the system, employees of
    the foundation are not allowed to buy lumens at auctions, and Stellar’s owners
    agreed not sell any of the lumens for at least five years.^([81](#fn_81))^,^([82](#fn_82))

    to rely upon to validate transactions. This protocol ensures that the Stellar

    Importers/purchasers want to make sure goods were shipped and often want extended

    financial risks of exporters and importers. The exporter’s bank may loan money
    to the exporter based on the contract. If exporters want to mitigate their risks

    POC—they were committed to developing a live platform in 12 months. To move things
    forward, they did not require unanimous decisions, but rather required a 51 percent
    or 67 percent majority depending on the complexity of the decision. To prevent
    anti-trust violations, the banks were prohibited from discussing go-to-market
    strategies. While the consortium was focused on the technical implementation,

    on a public blockchain. For Santander, a pilot is a significant undertaking because
    it involves real money, meaning that the solution must comply with all internal
    security requirements and with all regulations and it must be approved by the
    new products committee. It selected a bond issuance because it’s a low volume
    financial instrument with clearly defined rules. Santander could also use its
    separate legal entities to serve as the independent parties typically involved
    in a bond issuance and settlement. **^([130](#fn_130))**

- en: Santander’s Digital Bond Issuance was for a standard, one-year $20 million bond
    that paid a 1.98 percent fixed rate, payable over four quarters. It was launched
    in September 2019 on Ethereum, the public blockchain, which was used as the register
    and clearing house.^([131](#fn_131)) Banco Santander S.A. served as the *issuer*
    of the bond; Santander Securities Services Treasury as the *investor*; Santander
    Corporate Investment Bank served as the *dealer* which connects issuers with investors;
    and Santander Securities served as the *custodian* bank.^([132](#fn_132)) Based
    on legal advice from the global law firm Allen & Overy, Santander issued the digital
    bond under English law because English law requires a register of record, but
    it does not specify the type of register.^([133](#fn_133)) Under English law,
    a register of record could be a piece of paper, a spreadsheet, a central securities
    depository, or, yes, even a blockchain. (Santander could not use Spanish law because
    it requires that the register of record is a central securities depository.)

    $200,000 per unit.^([134](#fn_134)) [Figure 4.10](#f_4_10) depicts the workflow,

    of its scale. The global food and grocery retail market will exceed $12 trillion
    in 2020.^([3](#fn_3)) While much of the world’s food supply is safe, there is
    significant room for improvement. The World Health Organization reports that 600
    million people get food poisoning, and 420,000 die, each year from consuming contaminated
    foods.^([4](#fn_4)) Besides food contamination, the world food supply suffers
    significant amounts of food waste, food mislabeling, and food fraud, such as claiming
    horsemeat as lamb and claiming non-organically grown vegetables as organic.^([5](#fn_5))
    Human rights and environmental problems, such as slave labor and unauthorized
    use of pesticides, remain grave concerns. For example, the International Labor
    Organization estimates that 3.5 million people are forced to work in agriculture,
    fishing, and forestry.^([6](#fn_6)) Each country has its share of food safety
    challenges, but here we focus on the US and China as the largest food producers
    and consumers.

    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 48 million Americans get
    sick from food; 128,000 Americans are hospitalized; and 3,000 die of foodborne
    diseases, each year.^([8](#fn_8)) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) had
    61 active food recalls in January 2020, primarily for beef; pork; poultry; seafood;
    and salads. For example, The Pride of Florida recalled nearly 70,000 pounds of
    raw beef products that may be contaminated with *E. coli*. Other recalls were
    prompted by mislabeling, some by circumventing import inspections, some by misbranding,
    and some because of undeclared allergens.

    segment.^([11](#fn_11)) China has had a number of food safety crises. For example,
    in 2008, milk and infant formula were adulterated with a toxic substance (melamine)
    to boost the protein content that causes bladder and kidney stones, resulting
    in 300,000 infant illnesses and 54,000 hospitalizations.^([12](#fn_12)) In 2013,
    some local Chinese pork dealers lifted 15,000 dead pigs from a river, processed
    and sold them.^([13](#fn_13)) In 2020, Chinese fishmongers continued to add diesel
    fuel to dying fish to make them thrash.^([14](#fn_14)) Beyond these headlines,
    the use of pesticides, dangerous chemical additives, and unsanitary conditions
    remain challenges. To help improve food safety, the Chinese government consolidated
    food safety regulation with the creation of the State Food and Drug Administration
    of China (SFDA) in 2003\. However, in 2007, the head of the CFDA was executed
    for taking bribes. Today, about ten government departments and ministries are
    responsible for food safety, including the Ministry of Health; the State Food
    and Drug Administration; the Ministry of Agriculture; the State Administration
    for Industry and Commerce; the General Administration of Quality Supervision;
    Inspection and Quarantine; the Ministry of Commerce; the Ministry of Science and

    government, and academics need to be involved in food safety. While there is no
    single-pronged solution, sharing information across supply change partners is
    an important part of any food safety solution. As we have pointed out many times,
    without a blockchain solution, every party in the food supply chain manages its
    own systems of records (software and data) within the boundaries of the firm or
    relies on a trusted-third party to manage their systems on their behalf. Each
    party can only see data coming in and out of their own systems, which is why is
    can take weeks to trace a food recall from a retail store back to the originating
    farm or fishery. Improving food safety requires much better tracking of information
    as food passes through the entire supply chain; known as ‘farm to fork’ and ‘bait
    to plate’ traceability. Blockchain-enabled solutions offer the ability to share
    data with ecosystem partners in a secure way. In the food industry, a number of
    blockchain-based solutions have been developed. We’ll begin with the most well-established
    solution.

    embedded unique hash ‘watermark’ that can be viewed with a camera on a smart phone
    app. Second, the hash is permanently stored on the blockchain at time of origin.
    Additionally, the blockchain application will also store the part’s every movement
    and every transfer of ownership, thus enabling the part to be tracked and traced

    blockchain startup founded by three Deloitte blockchains leads in 2016, was one
    of its early partners. Nuco was building an interoperable blockchain network called
    Aion, which could serve as a hub.^([39](#fn_39)) Regenor said: *“Aion will allow
    us to move data between the multiple blockchains that could be present in our
    supply chain. We think this is a very important step, and we’re glad to be participating
    in it.”*^([40](#fn_40)) Regenor and his team also worked with a major ERP supplier
    because the platform would need to connect not only with other blockchains, but
    also to legacy ERP systems, particularly for Moog’s enterprise customers.'

    customers and technology providers. On February 7th 2018, Moog and Singapore Technology
    Aerospace (STA) announced the completion of a demonstration of the first digital
    end-to-end manufacturing of a 3-D printed part in the aerospace vertical on a
    blockchain. In the demonstration, STA bought a digital part from Moog using Microsoft’s
    Azure blockchain application and printed the part on premises at their facility.
    When STA downloaded the file, the settlement happened instantaneously; the payment
    used a token that moved value between Moog and STA.

    the use of blockchain for parts provenance using traditionally manufactured parts
    because the pathway for certification of 3-D printed aerospace parts is still
    being developed by the certification agencies. Regenor started exploring other
    technologies to uniquely identify traditionally manufactured parts. Moog did a
    POC with Alitheon, a company that uses simple mobile phone cameras and proprietary
    software to transform 54,000 unique surface characteristics of individual objects
    into a unique digital ID—no tags are appended, the object serves as its own identifier!
    (See [Figure 5.7](#f_5_7).) Alitheon’s software can scan the object at any time
    with a mobile phone, and if the object was previously recorded on the blockchain,
    the software authenticates the object and provides a match confidence score^.^([41](#fn_41))
    For the POC, Moog sent 20 metal parts to Alitheon for scanning, which Alitheon
    then sent back to Moog. Moog scanned them upon receipt, matched them with Moog’s
    ID, and then brutalized the materials by dropping them on concrete floors, grinding
    them with handheld motors, and grit blasting the parts. Moog sent these worn parts
    back to Alitheon, which was still able to identify the unique parts, even when
    only 3,700 unique surface features remained on the original parts.^([42](#fn_42))

    large, centrally-managed organizations have been operating with the same business
    models for 100 years or more and they are markedly energy inefficient. According
    to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, only 32 percent of electric energy
    generated in the US is actually ‘useable energy’, called ‘exergy’.^([6](#fn_6))

    upon, their major electric utility providers. Any excess capacity generated from
    a household solar panel is put right back into the traditional electric grid and
    the utility provider credits the consumer’s bill; the ‘prosumers’ – households
    that produce excess energy – have no market to sell excess capacity to besides
    the utility provider. That is, until now. Lawrence Orsini, founder and CEO of
    **LO3 Energy**, aimed to create a way for neighbors to buy and sell excess electric
    capacity directly from each other. His company, along with partners, built a technology
    platform to create peer-to-peer markets for the sharing economy (see [Table 6.1](#t_6_1)).

    local, reliable, efficient, and self-governing. He wanted to build the platform
    where prosumers sell excess energy capacity from their solar panels directly to
    neighbors using a mobile app. His idea became even more pertinent in the aftermath
    of Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York City in October of 2012\. It was the largest
    hurricane on record at the time—a whopping 1,100 miles in diameter. As Hurricane
    Sandy flooded the streets of New York City, power went out to over 800,000 residences
    and businesses and stayed off for days.^([17](#fn_17)) Even residents with solar
    panels could not use their own power because the photovoltaic panels (PV) that
    connected them to the utility grid were shut off. The pain and aftermath of Hurricane
    Sandy awakened consumers and made them receptive to LO3 Energy’s value proposition.

    the prosumers need the specialized hardware installed; consumers interact with
    the platform through a mobile or desktop app. LO3 is working with Siemens to build
    the physical grid that will separate from the main utility grid so that locally-generated
    power can be re-routed to critical locations in time of need.^([21](#fn_21)) Most

    Orsini had already met with regulators from Australia and Europe, but as a business
    model, it would be untenable for LO3 to lead the efforts for subsequent adoptions.^([36](#fn_36))
    Therefore, going forward beyond the Brooklyn Microgrid project, LO3 Energy will
    sell its transactive energy platform, Exergy, directly to other communities or
    institutions interested in adoption, but it will not own the projects. Local adopters
    are in the best position to rally neighbors, educate users and secure local regulatory

    incumbent utility providers by offering consumers a choice as to where they can
    buy and sell electricity credits. The business model evolved to welcome utilities.
    Orsini said in 2019, *“The whole intent of LO3 is to enable consumer choice, so
    people can decide with their dollars what the future looks like, who they’re buying
    energy from, where it comes from and how it’s produced. But that doesn’t sideline
    utilities—in fact, they are a huge part of this.”^([44](#fn_44))* To that end,
    LO3 Energy released Pando in 2019, a software solution that brings utility providers
    into the community. Pando connects utilities and retailers to their customers,
    who are in turn, connected to their communities (see [Figure 6.6](#f_6_6)).

    consumption that is sustainable, local, reliable, efficient, and self-governing.
    LO3 energy is ahead of other players in the space because Orsini and his team
    knew that they needed to do more than just build a great platform—they needed
    to prove they could get the platform legally and socially embedded into a real
    community, which they did with the Brooklyn Microgrid. To scale globally, they
    also needed to show that its platform could attract other partners, particularly
    incumbent utilities, to build new business models on top of it.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LO3 Energy and Share&Charge are two powerful ‘Internet of Value’ examples for
    the energy sector. They are each providing a peer-to-peer platform to empower
    everyday prosumers and consumers to share their energy resources. Their adoption
    journeys are similar in that each launched a POC on public Ethereum that expanded
    consumer awareness. Their founders simultaneously built network effects by uniting
    with partners across country borders, worked with regulators, and built a more
    robust platform based on a faster and more scalable consensus mechanism than Ethereum’s
    proof-of-work. In the next chapter, we explore the challenges of credentialing
    and an application solution called SmartResume.

    the full vision. We are still missing the full power of individual self-sovereignty
    over our own identities and credentials and a truly user-friendly experience across
    blockchain platforms. Many organizations, consortia, and standards-making bodies
    are working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) and interoperability. In the future,

    and Instagram (35 percent).^([6](#fn_6)) While such solutions do have the advantages
    of convenience and scale, they equally frustrate job seekers and recruiters. Distrust
    happens on both sides of the market. Specifically, recruiters doubt applicants’
    self-reported credentials and skills, while job seekers distrust that hiring companies

    Some large companies have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to modernize
    recruitment, but so far results did little to reduce biases. For example, Amazon’s
    AI recruiting tool was designed to search for keywords based on past engineering
    candidates’ resumes. Since most engineers were male in the past, the AI tool learned
    to prefer male applicants. Amazon abandoned the tool after the gender bias was
    revealed.^([12](#fn_12)) Social media, job site platforms, and AI tools are not
    the only sources of selection bias; relying on referrals from current employees
    creates a homogeneous applicant pool because people tend to refer people who are

    educational institutions, an additional benefit of joining the SmartResume platform
    is that it serves as a meaningful way to connect with alumni. For workforce skill
    certifiers—such as organizations that train and certify truck drivers; steamfitters,
    pipefitters, sprinkler systems installers; and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning

    personal SmartResume with additional information, such as career objectives, hobbies,
    and interests. Hiring organizations can ascertain which credentials were verified
    by credentialing organizations by the presence of the blockchain badge and which
    entries were added by individuals. Each individual gets one SmartResume, which
    may contain verified credentials from many different organizations. Individuals
    are in control of their job matching preferences and may grant or deny full access

    of the features for which blockchain technologies and traditional technologies
    are best suited. Blockchain technology was selected to create a tamper-proof audit
    trail of verified credentials in a multi-party environment. Traditional databases
    were selected for high performance and scalability processes, such as searching

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first time Dave Wengel searched for “certified digital resumes”, back in
    2017, he was shocked to find zero results. Why hadn’t anyone built a multi-credentialed
    resume? Wengel thinks it’s because *“there’s no value if you do not have a consortium.”*
    He began to envision the solution and, based on his company’s experiences, he
    knew building a consortium would be the key to success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: iDatafy’s first product was ***LeadReview*®**, a proprietary data consortium
    used to detect bad marketing leads. The solution was launched at the end of 2011
    and has since processed more than 100 million queries. The company’s second data
    consortium, ***StudentReview*®**, was developed in 2012 to detect student financial
    aid fraud in the US. The context was very similar to the job acquisition process
    in that the market for financial aid was subject to deception and mistrust. Many
    individuals with no intention of attending college were signing up for US Federal
    government financial student aid (called ‘Pell grants’) and would drop out immediately
    after receiving the money, enroll elsewhere, and repeat the deceit. In some cases,
    criminals organized into rings that recruited ‘straw students’ by promising them
    a share of the grant money. By 2011, criminals were swindling billions of dollars
    each year from the US federal government. iDatafy researched the problem and discovered
    that the individuals re-used the same contact information (like home addresses)
    to receive the checks. iDatafy created a consortium of higher education institutions
    to build and share a FERPA-compliant directory data about the students who habitually
    drop out and try to enroll in multiple schools. The StudentReview platform automatically
    analyzes the data and flags instances where contact information is duplicated.
    The system alerts colleges and universities when a new applicant has dropped out
    of other schools after receiving financial aid.^([22](#fn_22))

    they aim to reestablish trust in markets. Each context also requires a consortium
    to build an ecosystem solution. To build a successful consortium, iDatafy developed
    a three-phased process called ‘**crawl, walk, run**’. We illustrate the process
    with the SmartResume consortium.

    chair of the information systems department (ISYS); and the associate vice provost
    from the registrar’s office. While most of the leaders were supportive of the
    idea, they were initially concerned about adding another major IT project given
    the campus was in the middle of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement.
    They did not want to build an interface to pull student records from a system
    that was about to be replaced. Wengel listened to the feedback and suggested a
    pilot with 20 students so that it would add very little to the university’s workload.

    Also in fall, small SmartResume pilot programs began. The Walton College recruited
    10 ISYS students and 10 ISYS alumni to volunteer to be the first individuals to
    receive smart resumes. The university registrar launched the volunteers’ SmartResumes
    on the platform by verifying credentials, doing so manually, one student at a
    time. The volunteers then activated their SmartResumes and provided iDatafy with
    feedback. iDatafy learned that there were many more skills and activities that
    should be certified in addition to degree programs, including the aforementioned
    Leadership Walton. Dean Waller agreed to manually verify Leadership Walton participation
    and other non-transcript accomplishments to appear on the students’ SmartResumes.

    hiring organizations that recruit on many campuses wondered if there was a better
    way to find talent given that universities award similar degree programs, but
    name them differently. For instance, an information systems degree at one school
    might be called Computer Information Systems; Management Information Systems;
    Information Technology; Business Information Technology; Business Computing; or

    universities to issue a diploma on a blockchain. In 2017, 111 students were given
    a Blockcerts Wallet app with access to a verified, tamper-proof digital diploma
    with its hash stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.^([25](#fn_25)) One of the major
    lessons from the experiment was that users found it difficult to manage their
    own private keys.^([26](#fn_26)) To scale the app for live production, MIT engaged
    the vendor, Learning Machine. As of 2020, all recent MIT graduates receive a digital
    diploma in addition to a physical diploma. Students opt in to activate the digital
    diploma by clicking on an official MIT invitation email sent to all recent graduates.
    Students download the Blockcerts mobile app and add MIT as an issuer. The app
    generates a unique public key, which users can share with hiring organizations.
    Hiring organizations use the public key to verify credentials on the web portal,
    [https://credentials.mit.edu/](https://credentials.mit.edu/). The service is free.^([27](#fn_27))

    institution, namely MIT. If everyone adopted this model, users would be given
    multiple public keys and hiring organizations would need to go to multiple portals
    to verify a single candidate. For this reason, **Blockcerts** has continued to
    build an open source community (MIT is not actively involved) where a user may
    have multiple issuers. The Blockcerts community has developed versions that run
    Ethereum, Sovrin and Hyperledger.^([29](#fn_29)) The software is published under
    MIT Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) license. Institutions that have built
    their own credentialing solutions using the open source software include McMaster
    Engineering in Canada, Georgia Tech in the US, and Universidad Carlos III in Madrid.
    Rather than build a solution, institutions can also hire companies like Learning
    Machine, which continues to help institutions implement Blockcerts.^([30](#fn_30))
    Customers include the Southern New Hampshire University, Republic of Malta, Federation
    of State Medical Boards (FSMB), and National Training Agency’s (NTA) Workforce
    Preparedness Program in the Bahamas. Blockcerts is planning to add photo IDs and
