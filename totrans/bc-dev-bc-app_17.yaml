    yarn so that it can go around the side and bottom of the soap holder, leaving
    about 1o inches at the end to be weaved. Once you’re sure that much length is
    left, cut the yarn.To join the edges of the soap holder, fold it lengthwise with
    the right sides together. By weaving the yarn through the loops on the end of
    your stitches, sew up the side and bottom. Weave in the yarn tale with the yarn
    needle and cut off any extra. Then turn the holder inside out.To crochet the tie
    closure: Chain 60 and SL ST into each chain. Use the yarn ends to help you pull
    the tie through the holes that were made by the HDC and the SC. Then weave them

    and SC.Scrap Yarn Crochet ProjectsMost projects lead to leftover yarn, which can

    through.Step 2: Pull the working yarn through the loop to begin chaining. Make
    26 chains.Step 3: Turn the work and insert a finger into the second chain to pull
    up the working yarn. Place each loop on the thumb and pointer finger and pull
    the working yarn through, making the first SC. Continue to SC each chain. At the
    end of the row, CH 1, and turn the work.Step 4: Place your finger under the first
    ‘V’ stitch to pull through the working yarn. Pull it through by inserting a finger
    and thumb into each loop. Continue with SC for the rest of the row.Step 5: CH
    1 at end of the row, turn, and SC the row. Repeat SC until your blanket reaches
