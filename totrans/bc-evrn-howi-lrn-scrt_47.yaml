- en: Using the Blockchain Investor Scorecard, you can decide whether a blockchain
    token or altcoin is a sound investment. This is called “due diligence,” also known
    as “doing your homework.” You’ll come out of this exercise more informed than
    the vast majority of blockchain investors.

- en: At Bitcoin Market Journal, our analysts use this "scorecard" to evaluate new
    blockchain projects and tokens. By rigorously asking the same questions across
    several different categories, the blockchain investor or entrepreneur can have
    an "apples to apples" comparison of different business ideas.

    (higher potential). The score for each question is averaged at the end of each

    no to many opportunities before you say yes to one. When you do say yes, you can
    invest with confidence—because of all the research and analysis you’ve done using
    our scorecard.
