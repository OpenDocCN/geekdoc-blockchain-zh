    and information, which raises several security-related concerns that may compromise
    the entire supply-chain management [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)]. Several organizations
    from all over the world have reported various forms of challenges involving security
    breaches. The security concerns associated with supply-chain management come in
    potential damage to the transported materials and information security risks.
    Failure to control such barriers often triggers perceived insecurity, hindering
    an organization’s physical and economic performance [[3](#CR3)]. Due to these
    reasons, the concept of security management has always been integrated into supply-chain
    management to help curb the associated dangers [[3](#CR3)].

    regardless of the industries in which they operate. It is defined as any crime
    facilitated or undertaken using a computer, a network, or an associated hardware
    device [[4](#CR4)]. The computer or network involved in cybercrime can be the
    criminal’s target, facilitator, or agent during the time of the attack. The rates
    of cybercrime attacks continue to rise, a condition that suggests increased levels
    of information insecurity. For instance, Symantec’s study suggests an 81% increase
    in malicious attacks between 2010 and 2011 [[4](#CR4)]. According to experts,
    such attacks substantially negatively impact communities and industries [[4](#CR4),
    [5](#CR5)]. Cyberattacks are also reasonable for other damaging consequences like
    brand image loss [[4](#CR4)].

    to make the same mistakes considered the causes of such problems. This situation
    suggests a general lack of information and awareness of the causes and damages
    associated with poor security management. The studies also fail to provide the
    most basic information regarding the causes and solutions to the problems emanating
    from poor security and privacy standards in the supply chain. This study tries
    to analyze the role of blockchain technology in enhancing security management
    in supply-chain management. It is evident, from statistics, that most companies
    are ignorant of the benefits of blockchain technology, especially its role in
    enhancing supply-chain security. Institutions that have employed this technology
    in the past also seem to be aware of the security loopholes. Thus, the project
    intends to enlighten organizations and individuals on the benefits of embracing
    security measures when undertaking supply-chain activities.

    standards in typical supply-chain situations. The first objective is to bridge
    the gap in current literature and general information about supply-chain management
    concepts since empirical studies about blockchain technologies are almost absent
    [[6](#CR6), [7](#CR7)]. It also attempts to popularize blockchain technology to
    expand the extents to which it is employed in various organizations. Since blockchain
    is a relatively emerging concept, it is evident that most institutions are not
    entirely familiar with its application. Consequently, there are several cases
    in which this technology’s application becomes prone to security issues due to
    a lack of adequate knowledge. The paper proceeds to provide a more detailed analysis
    of the blockchain approach to supply-chain management, which is expected to improve
    the technology’s general knowledge and application. The paper also analyzes the
    general security issues while offering the most recommendable approaches to counteracting
    them. Overall, the paper is expected to change the public’s understanding of blockchain
    technology related to security and privacy, two of the essential aspects of supply-chain
    management in contemporary corporate society.

    and systematic network between a business, its suppliers, and the end client to
    lower expenses and be competitive on the market [[8](#CR8)]. Diverse processes,
    data flows, people, and other resources make up the system. All the phases and
    organizations involved in transporting a product from its initial condition to
    the end consumer are included in the supply chain. Blockchains are used to enable
    agreements, payments, and delivery in contemporary supply-chain management systems.
    Effective management is required to improve supply-chain operations and achieve
    lower costs and a faster production cycle. The article gives information on how
    vital a blockchain is to the supply-chain system. In the current world, security
    is one of the critical elements one should consider before doing any transaction
    within the market. Through the use of the blockchain technique, several activities
    have been achieved in the market. The technological idea generated by using the
    blockchain system enables the customer to believe and trust the supply-chain system.
    Through blockchain technology, most of the activities within the supply-chain
    environment can highly be monitored and protected against malicious individuals.

    of digital blocks linked together in an impenetrable and immutable way. Hash codes
    are produced using a one-way cryptographic algorithm utilizing block data to identify
    each block uniquely [[8](#CR8)]. We cannot use a blockchain to handle the whole
    supply chain because of its complexity. Partial blockchain adoption can improve
    inventory control because of its security, transparency, and efficiency. Besides,
    blockchain adoption is used by most current supply-chain systems [[9](#CR9)].
    In addition to reducing supply-chain costs, Blockchain-Supply Chain Management
    (BC-SCM) improves consumer, supplier, and retailer confidence by enabling them
    to trace goods from their origin to their final destination, according to a recent
    study. In that way, they can check for a product or material authenticity and
    avoid product fraud. This article will review how the blockchain system improves
    the security of the supply chain and creates confidence in the market in the transaction

    Joshi et al. hypothesize five different perspectives from which blockchain security
    can be attained. The main principles of blockchain security enhancement include
    defense in penetration, minimum privilege, vulnerability management, risk management,
    and patches management [[10](#CR10)]. Each of these techniques aims to protect
    the information belonging to transacting parties in a blockchain from theft or

    study has a weakness that limits its complete application. It discusses the idea
    of security in a far too public domain to be considered applicable in this paper’s

    security and privacy in a blockchain and how they can be exploited to ensure security
    and privacy are attained. Using their blockchain-based model, they present what
    they believe to be the most common sources of security and privacy compromises
    in blockchain technology. They proceed to describe how network administrators
    can counteract such threats. Their model is used to illustrate such systems’ vulnerabilities
    and how they can be counteracted. Under this model, blockchain systems can be
    subjected to either the DDoS or linking attacks [[11](#CR11)].

    and traffic of information in a network or server-based transactions, the blockchain
    offers practical methods of counteracting such problems. Their blockchain-based
    model is equipped with various hierarchical systems that make it resilient to
    DDoS attacks [[11](#CR11)]. The model designed is characterized by the property
    where all transactions are checked by the system miners, a condition that makes
    it impossible for hackers to install malware on the system directly [[11](#CR11)].
    The first hierarchy of preventing such acts, based on this model, is by making
    the component devices inaccessible. The following two hierarchies of this defense
    setup consist of specially designed configurations managed by network administrators.
    While the first defense layer prevents the DDoS attackers from making any director
    alterations to the critical components of a network such as codes and firmware,
    the following configurations are intended to ensure that the network administrators
    are in control of any activities within the network or server, such that the permission
    to access the information within the network is granted only to authorized persons.

    between one social media user and others can be inferred with high precision levels.
    It aims to reveal the connections that a specific user attempts to hide as a means
    of maintaining confidentiality [[12](#CR12)]. Linking attacks can take forms such
    as links reconstruction, which often result in the exposure of information that
    is meant to be confidential to third parties [[12](#CR12)]. The criminals who
    use this technique have been highly enhanced by the emergence of public media
    platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Users from various parts of
    the world often use vital information that describes their relations and other
    essential properties to hackers by presenting them on their social media pages.
    Many users’ attempts to keep specific categories of information help the attackers
    identify valuable enough information to be their specific targets while orchestrating
    link reconstruction attacks [[12](#CR12)].

    personal data can still be accessed even when a user takes precautionary measures,
    such as revealing none of their data except links to the social network [[12](#CR12)].

    of security issues in a blockchain. It mentions issues such as the DDoS and linking
    attacks. It proceeds to claim that it is easier for network administrators whose
    operations and transactions are designed as blockchain to control these issues
    using various techniques. These discussions and the associated recommendations
    attempt to reveal the blockchain’s superiority, especially regarding its role
    in providing security and privacy in activities such as the supply chain characterized

    narrow their discussions to blockchain technology as employed in managing security
    systems in smart homes. They also provide their approach to developing a smart
    home configuration that is not vulnerable to the stated security threats. This
    approach is highly discriminative concerning the size of the audience to which

    in any sector, it has to offer all constituent components of data security. Halpin
    and Piekarska mainly focus on security and privacy as the core features that make
    blockchains popular. According to these authors, the technology enhances data
    security by overcoming the typical database’s weaknesses, not offering any cryptographic
    advantages. Thus, many people and organizations, especially those operating in

    concepts. These scholars’ main security element is restricted access to blockchains
    and their contents. Blockchains are characterized by permissionless access, which
    raises security concerns. This feature is expected to open avenues for malicious
    individuals to inject more users into the blockchain while remaining in remote
    control of such users. The researchers agree that using the proof-of-work method
    solves this problem by ensuring that only authorized persons can access blockchains
    and their contents. The study proceeds to discuss privacy in blockchains using
    the bitcoin situation as a prominent example. Bitcoins, which are typical examples
    of blockchains, offer high anonymity and pseudonymity levels. Since pseudonymity
    and anonymity are two of the most fundamental privacy components, Halpin and Piekarska
    successfully persuade their audience about blockchain technology’s effectiveness

    enabling merchants to move beyond only the 4Cs. As a result of the platform, they
    can communicate with their suppliers better. At a glance, customers may view the
    total inventory, sustainability indicators, as well as diamond compliance. Using
    an audit trail that cannot be altered may also credibly assert certificate claims
    to other parties. Since the blockchain is being used, we know that product provenance
    can be tracked on the platform. As a result, it assumes compliance with ISO27001,
    which regrettably does not offer any objective criteria that the machine can immediately
    verify when anything goes wrong with it. In other words, it is impossible to automatically
    identify frauds caused by subjective compliance with the authentication methods.

    different cross-border systems and infrastructures. As a result of such solutions,
    parties can build confidence and trust with one another across borders. Therefore,
    given that cross-border communication requires dispute resolution, some experts
    have called for the development of systems that automatically resolve digital
    disputes arising from cross-border businesses by documenting all interactions
    between participants in a blockchain. IBM’s blockchain has created such a repeatable
    solution that changes the process of resolving disputes between many supply chain
    actors. Specifically, it is used by IBM as a single source of truth accessible
    only to authorized parties. Smart contracts automatically implement agreements
    and business rules. In theory, stakeholders transmit processed data directly from
    their recording systems to the blockchain, giving selected/permitted participants
    visibility. In a multi-participant environment, privacy is protected by not allowing
    others to see it. Data input mistakes are also avoided. Following that, the solution’s
    business logic detects inconsistencies between data components and documents to
    identify the underlying cause of any disputes. A supply-chain disagreement may
    arise because of a faulty measurement unit, incorrect delivery location, or incorrect
    amount supplied. In taking the telecom industry as an example, everyone must agree
    on data, SMS, voice use, and prices to be paid. As new data becomes available,
    all comparisons are made in near real time. The consequence is a significant reduction
    in the time it takes to resolve conflicts. Disagreement data is synthesized using
    IBM’s platform’s automatic dispute settlement rules [[20](#CR20)].

    Many additional solutions have been created to protect intellectual property by
    creating transparent and traceable ownership rights based on blockchain technology
    [[19](#CR19)]. On the contrary, one system looked at mechanisms for cross-border
    coordination that were visible and traceable. The activity was done to aid in
    developing the design and analysis of coordination policies [[19](#CR19)]. For
    example, the Gcoin blockchain is utilized to make transactions irreversible, consensus
    driven, and transparent in the medication supply chain. It also aims to enable
    a surveillance net by extending the management structure of the medication supply
    chain. Through data mining, government agencies establish a risk threshold to
    sustain the surveillance net. Later, if a drug stakeholder’s/transaction company’s
    behavior does not meet the criteria, the smart contract may raise an alert and
    request an inspection. Whenever a product has software, tracking the dynamic characteristics
    of the product becomes more difficult.

    The blockchain distributed ledger stores all data, inconsistencies, and consequential
    decisions, creating a complete and immutable audit history. When cross-chain and
    cross-border contacts are permitted, IBM’s technology has a significant flaw:
    it cannot settle conflicts. In addition, it is unable to resolve disputes arising
    from procedures that are not designed using smart contracts. First of all, the
    blockchain is decentralized. The ledger verification is decided by agreement among
    network members. Besides, to avoid misuse, most blockchains require users to do
    complicated computations repeatedly, resulting in high costs associated with this
    need. Similarly, verifiable data audit does not rely on a blockchain and does
    not waste energy resources. Another advantage is that it has a treelike structure
    instead of a chain. Blockchain is comparable in many respects to the verified
    data audit, though. Upon adding an entry to a ledger, a “cryptographic hash” value
    is generated. This value summarizes not just the current entry but also all of
    the initial values in the ledger. An entry’s hash value will be affected and that
    of the entire tree due to this impact [[18](#CR18)].'

    it. Besides, languages such as Solidity provide inheritance, allowing procedures
    and methods to be created beyond the bounds of a particular contract. The ability
    to manipulate variables is crucial to discovering more sophisticated vulnerabilities
    from a static posture. Information is propagated iteratively from function arguments
    to program state, capturing control flow information over possibly many transactions.

    often trouble the administrators of small and large corporations. The first class
    of questions revolves around the source of the security challenges that paralyze
    most managers’ attempts to attain successful supply-chain activities. This part
    of the study question is mainly intended to be a fact-finding tool for the stated
    concerns. The second part of the question dwells on searching for the perfect
    response to these concerns to evade the damaging impacts associated with them.
    The blockchain, the most contemporary concept in supply-chain management, has
    been selected as the main avenue through which solutions to these issues can be
    obtained. The research’s specific study questions are as follows:'

    be obtained, several information sources were used, including company websites,
    case studies, existing literature, past news reports, and conference papers. The
    main objective of using as many data sources was to ensure that enough information
    was available to facilitate further analysis to answer the study’s central questions.
    The gathered information was grouped into four basic categories. The first category
    consisted of all the security complaints presented by companies between years
    2000 and 2018.

    from various companies in ten different industries within the United Arab Emirates.
    The selected industries were agriculture, engineering, finance service, consultancy,
    healthcare, manufacturing, transport, automobiles, consumer electronics, and education.
    Twenty companies, including small and medium businesses, were selected from each
    industry, and the data was arranged appropriately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final category came in the form of a percentage of supply-chain operations
    that were undertaken using the blockchain technology in different organizations.
    A total of 200 UAE companies were selected for this section. Meta-analysis was
    used to sort the data into two sets of variables in which security and privacy
    were regarded as the primary independent variable. The number of firms using the
    blockchain and the percentage of supply-chain activities undertaken using the
    supply chain were regarded as dependent variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sorted data was then presented for analysis to establish the most crucial
    relationships among selected sets of variables. The analysis was done using the
    EViews software, which offers a simple approach to undertaking this process. Three
    principal tests were conducted to establish the required relationships. The selected
    tests were correlation, cross-correlation, and Granger’s causality tests. Each
    of these tests was aimed at realizing specific objectives. For instance, correlation
    analysis was intended to determine the possible existence of any form of relationship
    between the dependent and the independent variables in each section. The cross-correlation
    aimed to investigate a more detailed insight into the correlations established
    among variables. On the other hand, Granger’s causality test was selected to enable
    the researchers to determine if any of the two variables cause the other. No ethical
    considerations characterized this study since there was no need for any permissions
    or actual participants whose privacies needed to be protected.

    technology. The average percentage of operations that the selected firms undertake
    using blockchain technology is 51%. On the other hand, the average number of security-based
    complaints encountered by these organizations is 49.54%. The first conclusion
    that can be deducted from this data is that firms only use blockchain technology
    to an average extent. This information can also justify scholars’ arguments claiming
    that this concept is still new and has not been embraced by many firms. An average
    number of security-based complaints also imply that a relatively sizeable number
    of complaints characterized the period under investigation. The standard deviations
    corresponding to the percentage of operations done using blockchain technology
    and the number of security-related complaints are 29.15 and 36.75, respectively.
    These figures represent high standard deviations, which imply that most data points
    are widely scattered away from the stated means (see Table [1](#Tab1)).Table 1

- en: Relatively similar trends characterized the data corresponding to both security
    and privacy issues that were investigated during the research. The mean values
    for the number of firms using the blockchain method and the corresponding number
    of privacy-related lawsuits or complaints were 10.60 and 11.40, respectively.
    These values imply that there were a relatively low number of organizations using
    the blockchain technology. However, the mean for the number of complaints or lawsuits
    is only 11.40, which implies a relatively high number of complaints in each selected
    industry, especially considering that only a few firms represented each of the
    selected industries. Just like in the case of security data, this data was characterized
    by high standard deviations of 13.01 and 6.74 for the number of operations done
    using the blockchain technology and the number of privacy-based lawsuits and complaints,
    respectively. This trend implies that most of the data points used for this analysis
    were widely distributed away from the mean (see Table [2](#Tab2)).Table 2

    firms’ decisions to employ blockchain technology and the security or privacy issues
    at organizational levels. Practical conclusions regarding this investigation can
    only be reached after performing several tests to provide the statistical relationships
    among variables used. The selected tests for this study included correlation,
    Granger’s causality, and cross-correlation. Each test produced results that can
    be used to provide a detailed insight into the data and the principal themes being

    technology in undertaking various activities within an organization and the overall
    security of privacy trends within the industries studied. Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient (*P* value) was used as the primary metric for determining and quantifying
    these two variables’ relationships. The *P* value describing the relationship
    between the extent to which organizations employed blockchain technology in company
    operations and the resulting number of complaints encountered was −0.980536\.
    This figure can be interpreted as a strong negative correlation between two variables
    (see Table [3](#Tab3)).Table 3

    to security, especially about the trends shown by the analysis results. Pearson’s
    coefficient describing the relationship between the number of operations organizations
    conducted using the blockchain technology and the number of privacy-related complaints
    and lawsuits is −0.752065\. This number indicates a strong negative correlation
    between the number of supply-chain operations undertaken using blockchain technology
    and the number of privacy concerns within each analyzed industry. It also implies
    that the number of complaints is higher when there are low rates of applying this
    technology (see Table [4](#Tab4)).Table 4

- en: Correlation is a useful method of determining the relationship between sets
    of variables. However, this type of analysis informs the analyst about the existence
    or nonexistence of relationships among data. It also tells more about this relationship’s
    degree without offering any additional information about such a relationship.
    Granger’s causality test is regarded as an additional test that enables data analysis
    to learn about the relationships investigated. It mainly indicates if one of the
    variables causes the other while also offering reliable information about the
    direction of this causality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *P* values of each of the possible causality directions were used to determine
    the possible causality between two sets of variables in the security data. The
    decision was guided by the principle that the null hypothesis can be rejected
    when the *P* value is lower than 0.05, while it was not rejected in the cases
    where the *P* values were higher than 0.05\. This reasoning system also made it
    possible to determine the overall direction of causality in case it was identified.
    The *P* value associated with the ability of security-based complaints to affect
    the extent to which firms employed the blockchain technology was 0.008, while
    the *P* value associated with the ability of blockchain operations to affect the
    number of security-based complaints is 0.0925\. Since 0.008 is lower than 0.05,
    the null hypothesis number of security-based complaints causes the degree of application
    of the blockchain technology in undertaking supply chain within organizations
    to be rejected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the hypothesis that the extent to which firms use blockchain
    technology cannot be rejected since the associated *P* value is 0.0925 higher
    than the 0.05 limit. Consequently, it is worth concluding that there is a unidirectional
    causality between these variables (see Table [5](#Tab5)).Table 5

    between the two variables used here. The *P* values for each of the null hypotheses
    (privacy-based lawsuits do not Granger-cause the application of blockchain, and
    the blockchain application in organizations does not Granger-cause privacy-related
    complaints) were 0.7649 and 0.398, which are higher than the 0.05 limit. Consequently,
    none of these hypotheses could be rejected. This analysis implies that there is
    no causality between these two sets of variables in any direction. Thus, neither
    the application of the blockchain technology nor the number of privacy-related
    lawsuits and complaints Granger-causes the other (see Table [6](#Tab6)).Table

    This test’s main objective was to assess the two variable sets’ movement relative
    to each other. The principal rationale behind the test is that if the number of
    blockchain operations in various companies within the industry affects the number
    of security-related complaints in the same industry, then the values representing
    one variable will increase as the values representing the other increase. In essence,
    cross-correlation is employed when dealing with time-series information. The numbers
    representing the correlation range between −1 and +1 such that high cross-correlation
    among given sets of data is indicated by cross-correlation values close to 1\.
    According to the given data, there is a gradual increase in the values corresponding
    to the number of complaints from −0.9805 to −0.0162\. A similar trend is observed
    in the dataset corresponding to the organizations’ blockchain technology level
    within the sampled industry. These trends imply a negative cross-correlation between
    the level of application of blockchain technology in supply-chain operations and
    the number of complaints among industrial firms. Consequently, this data suggests
    a steady increase in the number of complaints as the level of application of the
    blockchain technology continues to decrease (see Table [7](#Tab7)).Table 7

- en: The study’s primary approach to representing security and privacy is through
    complaints related to each of these concepts. On the other hand, the blockchain
    technology application in organizations was measured using two principal approaches.
    The first approach involves using the percentage of company supply-chain operations
    undertaken using blockchain principles. This strategy enables the researcher to
    differentiate between security status within organizations when the blockchain
    technology is employed and the same trends in cases where the technology is not
    applied. The second method of quantifying blockchain technology’s widespread application
    is the data describing the number of companies that used blockchain as their main
    approach to handling transactions and data security in the supply chain. Overall,
    two variables were represented with reasonable activities that would help make
    it possible to perform quantitative analysis.

- en: The correlation test results revealed a correlation between the blockchain technology’s
    application in organizations and the corresponding privacy and security trends
    at both organizational and industry levels. Such statistics indicate that blockchain
    technology has become an integral aspect of both security and supply-chain management
    information. While this test offered a clear link between these two variables,
    it failed to offer more details. The cross-correlation test analysis provided
    additional information that was missing in the correlation test results. Data
    analysis findings suggest that the rate of security and privacy-related complaints
    decreases with an increase in this technology’s application. The final observation
    was that security concerns at both organizational and industrial contexts Granger-cause
    the blockchain technology level in the supply chain.

- en: Cases of security complaints and lawsuits about privacy violations become less
    when companies decide to use the blockchain. This observation’s rationale is that
    technology offers better security than traditional approaches to supply-chain
    operations. It suggests that the data describing documents and transactions associated
    with supply-chain activities are always safer when organizations opt to use the
    blockchain method in their supply-chain activities. The causality analysis findings
    can be interpreted to mean that companies who have previously fallen victims to
    data security and privacy violations often ensure that such situations do not
    recur. Therefore, they try to implement corrective mechanisms such as introducing
    the blockchain concept into their supply-chain operations. Therefore, from the
    data analysis results, it is evident that the rate of application of this encrypted
    data approach to the supply chain becomes more applicable whenever there are increasing
    trends in the number of security violation complaints. Overall, blockchain technology
    is becoming more popular among organizations in different sectors, attributed
    to the increasing cases of security and privacy violations during supply-chain
    operations.

- en: Blockchain technology remains one of the most exciting areas of research in
    contemporary society. This technology is applied in various sectors, such as the
    financial service sector, in which cryptocurrencies are used to provide anonymity,
    security, and confidentiality. According to the information provided by other
    scholars who have performed research in this field, blockchain technology is a
    practical approach to attaining and sustaining information security in any field
    of operation. Activities such as the proof-of-work equip this concept with the
    ability to control the identities of the people who have access to confidential
    information. The analysis of primary data reveals that security and privacy levels
    are always enhanced when data eruption strategies are used in the supply chain.
    The data also reveal that more organizations are becoming attracted to this strategy
    as they try to react to security and privacy violations. As revealed by the data,
    the most discouraging trend is that most organizations are not aware of this concept
    and its importance to their operations. Consequently, the cases of data insecurity
    remain high at both organization and industry levels.

    other fields such as the business opportunities associated with the technology
    and have not been exploited by society. The findings also guide the future society
    on the best ways through which the technology can be implemented in various sectors
    to ensure that privacy and data security issues in the supply chain are resolved.
    Another critical field that is open for further research is the idea of instances
    where the technology is considered to have weaknesses regarding its ability to
    offer absolute security and privacy.
