- en: 'Boston’s Federal Reserve building is a massive thirty-two-story monolith, not
    unlike the mysterious structure in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, only
    white. Standing in front of this structure is humbling and awe-inspiring, and
    somehow I had been invited inside. The occasion was a conference on blockchain
    technology, where an executive from the Federal Reserve gave a surprisingly powerful
    speech about how blockchain was changing global financial markets. I found it
    hard to concentrate, because I was fixated on one thought: I’m inside the freaking
    Fed.'

  zh: 波士顿的联邦储备银行是一座庞大的32层大厦，不像斯坦利·库布里克执导的《2001：太空漫游》中的神秘建筑那样黑，而是白色的。站在这座建筑前，会感到谦卑和敬畏，而我不知怎的被邀请进入了其中。那是一次关于区块链技术的研讨会，美联储的一名高管发表了关于区块链如何改变全球金融市场的强有力的演讲。我发现很难集中精力，因为我一直在想一个念头：我他妈的在美联储里面。
- en: 'The United States Federal Reserve is perhaps the most powerful organization
    on the planet. It maintains stability of the financial system through a diverse
    and complicated set of powers: setting interest rates, managing the U.S. Treasury,
    issuing currency, regulating private banks, and serving as a “lender of last resort.”
    If financial systems are built on trust, the Fed might be the most trusted institution
    in the world.'

  zh: 美国联邦储备银行可能是世界上最强大的组织。它通过一系列多样且复杂的权力维持金融系统的稳定：设定利率、管理美国财政部、发行货币、监管私营银行，还充当“最后贷款人”。如果金融系统建立在信任之上，美联储可能是世界上最受信任的机构。
- en: 'The Federal Reserve is a bank, but it’s also a building—twelve buildings, to
    be exact. And I was sitting in the basement of the Boston branch, in the belly
    of the beast: the lunchroom.'

    currencies replacing the dollar, so why were we creating “stablecoins” that were

    Tea Party Museum. “Isn’t it a human value? And isn’t this human thirst for independence
    a higher authority than a government?” I stopped in my tracks. “In our quest for
    independence, why do we need to ask for permission?”
