    of the Federal Reserve, working on a deal that would replace the Federal Reserve.

    unlike the mysterious structure in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, only
    white. Standing in front of this structure is humbling and awe-inspiring, and
    somehow I had been invited inside. The occasion was a conference on blockchain
    technology, where an executive from the Federal Reserve gave a surprisingly powerful
    speech about how blockchain was changing global financial markets. I found it
    hard to concentrate, because I was fixated on one thought: I’m inside the freaking
    Fed.'

    on the planet. It maintains stability of the financial system through a diverse
    and complicated set of powers: setting interest rates, managing the U.S. Treasury,
    issuing currency, regulating private banks, and serving as a “lender of last resort.”
    If financial systems are built on trust, the Fed might be the most trusted institution
    in the world.'

    currencies replacing the dollar, so why were we creating “stablecoins” that were
    now pegged to the dollar? It was like declaring you’re going to start your own
    country, but only after getting permission from your existing country.

    for independence from its tyrannical British overlords. But if that spirit of
    independence was really embedded in our national DNA, why shouldn’t that independence
    be wielded against the United States itself?

    independence, why do we need to ask for permission?”
