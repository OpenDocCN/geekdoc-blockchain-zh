- en: While blockchain is poised to do a great many different things in the near future,
    for now, the most important thing you will want to keep in mind is that blockchains
    make cryptocurrency possible. Bitcoin jumped in price to more than $19,000 during
    2017\. While this price has pushed it out of the league of many amateur investors,
    there are more than 1,000 different cryptocurrencies on the market these days,
    so there are plenty of opportunities out there for those who are interested in
    a potentially profitable investment. This is not to say that there isn’t risk
    involved as well, however; it is important to keep the risks of cryptocurrency
    investment in mind as well before making any investments in the space.

    of fraud taking place around them; they cannot be counterfeited, and there is
    no way for one member of the transaction to reverse it once a transaction has
    taken place.

    internet but do not have regular access to any form of exchange. This leaves the
    cryptocurrency market with a lot of room to maneuver, and it is expected to see
    significant growth as it gains wider acceptance. This means that an increasing
    amount of business will take place purely through digital currencies, which means
    those who invest in cryptocurrency now aren’t just likely to see an increase;
    they are likely to see a dramatic increase.

- en: Once you have bought into a cryptocurrency, there is less chance that you will
    have to worry about identity theft than when working with traditional online exchanges.
    This is a concern in traditional instances, as credit or debit cards are charged
    with each new transaction, which means that there is a far greater opportunity
    for identity thieves to find a way to crack the system and make off with personal
    information.

    and Ethereum has grown year over year since its inception, despite some down times
    in-between, that doesn’t mean that this will continue to be the case in the long-term.
    There simply not enough past data to say with any real degree of certainty what
    the market will look like in a year from now, much less 5 or 10, which means that
    both the potential for loss and the potential for gain are virtually limitless.
    Basically, what this means is that up until the time that the cryptocurrency market
    stabilizes, any dollar you put into Ethereum is just as likely to be worth more
    next year than it is today as it is to be completely worthless.

- en: While the digital nature of cryptocurrency is often touted as a positive, it
    is important to consider its negative aspects as well. For example, as a purely
    digital construct, if you were keeping your cryptocurrency in an exchange that
    had a server error that resulted in a loss of all its backup drives, what would
    happen to your currency then? Likewise, what were to happen if you put your coins
    into a physical wallet that then stopped reading on your computer?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of these cases are unlikely to happen, but if they were, then your cryptocurrency
    would be gone as if it had never existed in the first place. Furthermore, the
    massive potential for profits means that hackers are never going to stop trying
    to access these exchanges, so eventually, they will succeed. When investing in
    cryptocurrency, it is important to value security as highly as possible because
    there is very little standing between your investments and the void.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While bitcoin can be thought of as the most stable cryptocurrency, it is still
    six times as volatile than investing in the S&P 500 and five times as volatile
    as investing in gold. While this means there is an increased chance of profit,
    it also means there is an increased chance for risk as well. A vast majority of
    all cryptocurrency transactions are currently speculative in nature, which means
    that investors are buying and holding them. This, in turn, creates a bubble that
    has to eventually burst sooner or later. The trick with the bubble is to get in
    as early as possible and keep an eye out for signs that it will burst so you can
    get while the getting is good.

    the price is naturally going to be fairly limited. The opposite is true for cryptocurrencies,
    however, it is difficult to tell what will set investors off before it happens.
    Any currency news anywhere has the potential to set prices shifting dramatically;
    in fact, several of Bitcoin’s most significant moves have come about due to the
    introduction of controls for capital in Greece and when China devalued the Yuan.

    as it is open 120 hours each week, the cryptocurrency market is open 168 hours
    each week, and trades are always happening regardless of what part of the world
    is currently active. Currently, there are about 100 major cryptocurrency exchanges
    in the world who all offer various levels of trading, along with differing rates
    based on their level of service. As such, it should not take more than a little
    research to find the one that is right for you.

    these factors can be enough to generate large swings on a daily basis. In fact,
    price shifts of more than 5 percent are common on most days for the larger cryptocurrencies,
    and the smaller ones aren’t surprised if they see 15 percent movement or more.

- en: The fact that cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any higher power, coupled
    with the fact that they are a new form of investment and the fact that any event
    anywhere can lead to essentially unexpected movement, all combine to create an
    extremely volatile market. Swings of more than 5 percent in a single day are not
    uncommon for several different types of cryptocurrency, and the smaller currencies
    are capable of swinging with even greater frequency and to larger degrees.

- en: Of all the cryptocurrencies on the market today, the one that is the most dedicated
    to improving the quality of the blockchain experience as a whole is Ethereum.
    While its cryptocurrency, ether, sees a fair amount of speculation, it is mainly
    used to pay for transactions with smart contracts and applications designed to
    run on the Ethereum platform. It has already seen about half as many transactions
    as Bitcoin, despite only being around for a third of the time. It is also more
    firmly focused on the future, with its improved interactions with smart contracts
    and its decentralized app platform, as well.

    then you will see that it is nothing but peaks and valleys. It’s true that things
    tend to move in an overall positive direction, but it can hardly be called steady
    growth.

    even through the summer of 2017, when blockchain was at its current peak. It is
    important to keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are always going to be social
    constructs, which means that Ethereum’s robust network effects make it easier
    for the network, and its value, to continue to grow steadily moving forward.

- en: The final feather in ether’s cap is the fact that the Ethereum blockchain is
    all done on smart contract technology. Smart contracts are simple programs that
    can be added to blocks and then activated once a specific set of circumstances
    occur. While they are currently primarily being used for financial purposes, there
    is already interest in them for everything from monitoring patients in hospitals
    to providing notary services. In fact, one of the stated goals of Ethereum is
    to simplify the way that traditional contracts work, thus reducing the costs of
    such services significantly.

- en: The Ethereum platform can process a total of 25 transactions per second, though
    additional scalability is also possible. This process can lead to additional orphaned
    blocks that are never processed correctly; however, this isn’t a common occurrence.
    As of November 2017, a single ether is worth about $350\. By January, it was above
    $900.
