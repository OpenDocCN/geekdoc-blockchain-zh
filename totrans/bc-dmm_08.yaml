    value globally. The Ripple protocol allows for the fungibility of any type of
    asset — even between two unlike assets and in nonliquid markets. It does all this
    at extremely low cost, with exceptionally high security, and in record time. The
    Ripple infrastructure is being implemented as the framework for new modern banking
    and trading.

    but the original implementation was created by the Canadian developer Ryan Fugger
    in 2004\. Fugger’s first iteration was a decentralized monetary system that allowed
    individuals and communities to set up their own money.

    including E-Loan and Prosper, both of which were disruptive organizations that
    changed the consumer lending market. He joined Ripple in August 2012 and led it
    until 2016.

    the biggest names in the investing world backing them, Google Ventures and Andreessen
    Horowitz just to name a few. As of 2016, Ripple had raised more than $93 million
    in venture funding. Ripple is also politically active and sits on the Federal
    Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee and co-chairs the W3C’s
    Web Payments Working Group. It has offices in San Francisco, New York, London,
    Luxembourg, and Sydney. Many of the founding team have since left Ripple and started
    new projects.

- en: Ripple has been very disruptive in the banking industry and has seen substantial
    pushback for its efforts. In 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple $700,000 for Secrecy Act
    violations. The fine was for selling XRP to Roger Ver, a well-known Bitcoin investor,
    and failing to file a suspicious activities report because Ver has a felony conviction
    for selling fireworks on eBay. After the fine, DBS Bank and the Oversea-Chinese
    Banking Corporation Limited began refusing banking services to Ripple Singapore.
    It is believed that this happened because these banks felt that issuing assets
    on blockchains posed more regulatory risk than reward for them. Since then, Ripple
    has shifted its focus to primarily serving global and regional banks.

    Seeing How Ripple Differs from Other Blockchains'

- en: Ripple, like Bitcoin, is neutral and decentralized software. Almost anyone can
    use Ripple as an open standard to facilitate connectivity and interoperability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ripple is significantly different from Bitcoin in its structure and the way
    the network operates. Ripple is finding the most efficient exchange route, structuring
    transactions as debts, and using its cryptocurrency as the exchange mechanism
    between the different types of value that are traded on the Ripple network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ripple is all about trust, whereas other blockchains, for the most part, are
    about trustless systems. In Bitcoin, any two parties can send one another Bitcoin
    tokens and the network then validates that no one is cheating in that transaction.
    Part of the way Bitcoin balances every block of transactions is to check to make
    sure that all the tokens involved have only been spent once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another significant difference is that Ripple does not use proof-of-work consensus.
    The Ripple team has eliminated the large power burden needed by most blockchains
    to secure themselves. In doing so, Ripple uses significantly less electricity
    and is faster than traditional blockchains. You can dive deeper into how Ripple
    works by checking out the whitepaper at [`https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf`](https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ripple works very differently from other blockchains. One of the most noteworthy
    differences is how the network is decentralized and comes to consensus. The nature
    of decentralization in Ripple is subtle. A node can put any other nodes it wants
    into its validator list in order to listen to what transactions those nodes want
    to confirm. The only requirement is that there is sufficient overlap between each
    node’s validator lists, so the network doesn’t accidentally come to multiple different
    consensuses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ripple manages that by having each node maintain its own validator list, including
    Ripple’s own nodes. This ensures that there is sufficient overlap. As a node’s
    network grows, the node’s list will include more and more validators from well-known
    trustworthy and independent institutions around the world. Over time, Ripple’s
    consensus process will become more and more decentralized.

    important ways in which Ripple differs from Bitcoin:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    may be illegal if you aren’t licensed to do so. This is one of the reasons that
    Ripple targets large financial institutions as their users. Bitcoin can be used
    by everyone, and it’s specifically useful for small transactions.
  prefs:

- en: '**Ripple is based on a consensus algorithm rather than mining.** It uses probabilistic
    voting among trusted nodes. This type of consensus allows the nodes to come to
    agreement and confirm transactions in five seconds. With Bitcoin, a transaction
    may take hours.'

    markets.'
