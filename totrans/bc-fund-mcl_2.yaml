- en: Think back to the early 1990s. Are you old enough to remember the first time
    you saw the Internet through the friendly interface of a web browser? I do. It
    was 1994\. I was sitting in my office at Templeton College when my colleague showed
    me Mosaic, one of the first web browsers. I viewed it with curiosity for a few
    moments, but then went back to my ‘day job’. I venture to say I was not alone
    in initially ignoring—and certainly underestimating—the Internet’s long-term economic,
    social and political effects.

    Many visionaries saw its value long before I did. Finally, Lee Coulter, CEO of
    Ascension Shared Services at the time, explained blockchains to me on the back
    of a napkin during a dinner in San Francisco in May 2016\. I went home and read
    Don and Alex Tapscott’s forward-thinking book, *The Blockchain Revolution: How
    the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World*. The
    authors described how Bitcoin and other blockchain innovations were moving us
    from an ‘Internet of Information’ to an ‘Internet of Value’ where people transact
    value—i.e. money and other assets—in new ways. I could see the promise, and blockchains
    for business became my primary research focus.'

- en: I spent the first six months learning about the protocols that specify the rules
    for blockchains like Bitcoin; Ethereum; Ripple; Stellar; Corda; Fabric; and Quorum.
    The learning curve was brutal—it’s easy to fall down the technical rabbit hole.
    Terms like elliptic curve cryptography; proof-of-work; mining; digital wallets;
    native digital assets; smart contracts; hashing; Merkle roots; Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance; and zero-knowledge proofs, make it difficult to climb out and really
    understand what the technology enables for businesses. I developed and taught
    blockchain modules to Masters’ students at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis
    (UMSL) in the fall of 2016\. One of the aims of the course was to shortcut the
    technical learning curve for students and business professionals.

    in the Sloan School of Management, as a Visiting Scholar to study how enterprises
    were exploring blockchains. The research team included Dr. Jeanne Ross, Principal
    Research Scientist, and Kate Moloney, Research Specialist. During interviews,
    we asked managers about their blockchain adoption journeys, their participation
    in blockchain ecosystems, and the practices and lessons they have learned so far.
    We asked the following types of questions:'

- en: We interviewed executives from global enterprises currently exploring blockchains;
    from the professional services firms that sell services to them; and from the
    startups that want to disrupt them. The enterprises we studied primarily represent
    global financial services, but also included manufacturing and healthcare firms.
    The professional services firms included representatives from large organizations
    like Deloitte, KPMG, Capgemini, IBM, and Wipro, as well as boutique consulting
    firms. The startups included companies seeking to advance general blockchain technical
    capabilities and specific business-focused blockchain applications. In 2017, these
    enterprises were participating actively in industry blockchain consortia and developing
    many proof-of-concepts; none had deployed live production systems. In 2017 and
    2018, I also participated in (or more accurately *observed)* the Center for Supply
    Chain’s three studies to define blockchain standards for tracking and tracing
    pharmaceuticals.**^([iii](#rfn_iii))** Bob Celeste leads the group of about 100
    participants who represent pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors,
    and retail and hospital pharmacies. This experience helped me to understand the
    perceived benefits and concerns that supply chain partners have about shared blockchain
    applications.

    of Excellence (BCoE) at the University of Arkansas. We work with the Executive
    Advisory Board members on blockchain research, which include ArcBest; Ernst &
    Young (EY); FIS; Golden State Foods; IBM; JB Hunt; McKesson; Microsoft; Tyson
    Foods; and Walmart. We meet in closed workshops to hear from experts, which then
    informs our white paper and research briefing series. So far, we have investigated
    blockchain interoperability; shared governance models; messaging the C-suite;
    IoT and other enabling technologies; and digital identities. Overall, members
    are interested in deploying technologies to deliver real business value; blockchains
    are just one component that enable new solutions.

    to assess blockchain’s impact, including the reporting of blockchain activities
    in accounting reports and patent applications and awards in China and the US.
    Research team members include Dr. Dan Conway; Dr. Zach Steelman; Dr. Kris Allee;
    Jacob Yates; Jia Wei; and Yaping Zhu. Results are presented in [Chapter 2](chapter02.xhtml).

- en: This project aims to improve food safety for poultry in China. It is funded
    by the Walmart Foundation. The project entails collecting data on the salmonella
    and antibiotic residues using biosensor IoT devices; developing risk assessment
    and cost-benefit analyses; and tracing vital information from poultry breeding
    to retail outlets using blockchain technologies. The project is led by Yanbin
    Li, Distinguished Professor, Tyson Endowed Chair in Biosensing Engineering at
    the University of Arkansas. The University of Arkansas’ blockchain portion of
    the project is led by Kathryn Carlisle, Senior Managing Director of the BCoE and
    Professor John Kent, Supply Chain Management. The project is quite large, with
    leaders from Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center; South China Agricultural
    University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agricultural
    Technology; and China Agricultural University.

    for beef. It is being led by Dr. Aaron Shew, Assistant Professor of Agricultural
    Economics, Arkansas State University; Rudy Nayga, Distinguished Professor and
    Tyson Chair in Food Policy Economics and Heather Snell, Program Associate for
    the University of Arkansas. Based on 1,000 participants, we found that respondents
    valued blockchain and digital ledger tech names similarly and were willing to
    pay a premium for the information compared to the current meat labeling system.
