    thinkers in human history.

- en: A systemic thinker is a polymath—an expert who works across disciplines, spotting
    connections others may not see by going broad as well as deep. For example, a
    systemic thinker may see that Michelangelo’s David has more in common with Dante’s
    Divine Comedy than it does with Bernini’s David, despite both statues of David
    studying the same Biblical subject. Why? Dante and Michelangelo were Renaissance
    creators whose works displayed the humanism, symmetry, order and clean lines of
    the Renaissance. By contrast, Baroque creators, such as Bernini or Mozart, favored
    ornate detail over simplicity as well as movement over stability. Systemic thinkers
    learn to spot such patterns horizontally—patterns that even the greatest experts
    in each vertical may not be able to see.

- en: Satoshi Nakamoto is a true polymath—one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
    systemic thinker of our time. Satoshi’s invention, the Bitcoin blockchain, was
    cross-disciplinary. Satoshi solved a computer science problem long considered
    unsolvable by computer scientists, by applying knowledge from outside computer
    science. To create Bitcoin, Satoshi applied elements of economics, psychology
    and behavioral science to cryptography and distributed systems.

    a blockchain allows multiple parties to see the same data at the same time and
    trust that it’s valid. A blockchain is a ‘golden copy’ of information upon which
    all users can rely. It is shared technology infrastructure.

- en: What problem does blockchain technology solve? Expressed in practical terms,
    on the one hand, blockchain solves the duplication/reconciliation problem—when
    parties don’t trust each other, they need to keep and reconcile their own copies
    of data. Expressed in philosophical terms, on the other hand, blockchain solves
    the trust problem. To establish trust, today we use an army of auditors; accountants;
    trustees; lawyers; transfer agents; registrars; county clerks; asset custodians;
    and myriad other forms of third-party validators, and sometimes we throw in a
    central counterparty to stand in between, and then we duplicate and reconcile
    the same data across each of these parties. Until blockchain came along, there
    was no avoiding all this—it was the cost of establishing trust. But it’s a tremendously
    inefficient and resource-intensive way to create trust. Blockchain is a database
    architecture that can streamline these processes massively. It’s a cheaper way
    to create trust.

    There is no gatekeeper. There is no central target for hackers to attack.

- en: Some of you may find the analogy to Google Docs helpful. When students use Google
    Docs to write a term paper, they share the same document with multiple parties
    at the same time and can see their colleagues editing it in real-time. But there’s
    a problem. Google controls the data, and you have no way of knowing whether Google
    tampered with it. A blockchain is ‘like Google Docs but without Google’—because
    no party has a controlling role in a true blockchain. No one owns the network
    because every participant in the network owns it.

- en: Now let’s talk about Bitcoin, the first blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto actually
    didn’t invent anything new in 2008\. Rather, Satoshi combined several existing
    advances in a way no one had combined them before, and the advances cut across
    disciplines—spanning math (i.e., cryptography), computer science (i.e., distributed
    systems/peer-to-peer networking) and economics (i.e., game theory). The use of
    game theory was Satoshi’s real genius—Satoshi reinforced the technology with asymmetric
    incentives.

    to verify them once they’ve been added, thereby making it very easy to enforce
    property rights within this system. It’s prohibitively expensive to attack the
    Bitcoin network—it would cost billions just to re-write this morning’s transaction
    history—but cheap for individuals to participate in the network by simply downloading
    the open-source Bitcoin software to become a network node.

    growth in the value of bitcoin doesn’t cause more bitcoin to be produced. Growth
    in the value of gold causes more gold to be mined or growth in the value of the
    dollar enables the Federal Reserve to print more of them. Rather, growth in bitcoin’s
    price ONLY makes the network more secure. There will never be more than 21 million
    bitcoins, regardless of how high its price goes. As more people join the Bitcoin
    network, it simply becomes more immune to attack.

- en: And Bitcoin has never been hacked successfully. It is almost certainly the most
    secure technology system ever built. Wait, you might be thinking, what about the
    hacks I’ve read about? Those hacks happened within insecure applications built
    on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The underlying Bitcoin blockchain itself—the
    base ledger layer—has NEVER been successfully hacked. And it’s worth $560 billion
    on the day of this writing, so there’s quite a hacker’s bounty! Bitcoin’s success
    from a cybersecurity standpoint is even more notable when you learn that Bitcoin
    is not protected by a firewall. It lives in the wilds of the Internet and hackers
    constantly try but fail to penetrate it. Why? Remember, Bitcoin works because
    it’s a beautiful balance of technology and economic incentives—hackers would spend
    a lot more money to hack it than they would gain from doing so.

- en: It took a systemic thinker—with top-notch skills in cryptography and computer
    science and a keen understanding of game theory, monetary history and human behavior—to
    concoct such a beautifully-balanced system. And in doing so, Satoshi solved a
    problem that the computer science field had tried to solve for decades, called
    the Byzantine Generals Problem. Put simply, how would generals fighting on a Byzantine
    battlefield know that messages they received from other generals during battle
    weren’t tampered with during their journey across the battlefield? This was considered
    by many to be an unsolvable problem in the computer science specialty of distributed
    systems, but Satoshi solved it. Perhaps if computer scientists had spent more
    time talking to economists and behavioral scientists all along, it might have
    been solved a lot sooner!
