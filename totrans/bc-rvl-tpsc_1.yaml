    of people, and supports a global economy worth more than $100 trillion.[¹](notes.xhtml#en0090en)
    It’s the world’s most powerful industry, the foundation of global capitalism,
    and its leaders are known as the Masters of the Universe. Closer up, it’s a Rube
    Goldberg contraption of uneven developments and bizarre contradictions. First,
    the machine hasn’t had an upgrade in a while. New technology has been welded onto
    aging infrastructure helter-skelter. Consider the bank offering Internet banking
    but still issuing paper checks and running mainframe computers from the 1970s.
    When one of its customers taps her credit card on a state-of-the-art card reader
    to buy a Starbucks grande latte, her money passes through no fewer than five different
    intermediaries before reaching Starbucks’s bank account. The transaction takes
    seconds to clear but days to settle.

    Goldberg）的复杂装置，发展不均，矛盾重重。首先，这个机器已经很久没有升级了。新技术被胡乱焊接在陈旧的基础设施上。想想那个提供网上银行但仍然发行纸质支票并运行着1970年代的大型计算机的银行。当它的一个客户用一张信用卡在尖端刷卡机上刷卡购买一杯星巴克的大杯拿铁时，她的钱在到达星巴克的银行账户之前至少要通过五个不同的中介。这笔交易在几秒钟内就处理完毕，但结算却需要几天时间。
- en: Then there are the large multinationals like Apple or GE that have to maintain
    hundreds of bank accounts in local currencies around the world just to facilitate
    their operations.[²](notes.xhtml#en0091en) When such a corporation needs to move
    money between two subsidiaries in two different countries, the manager of one
    subsidiary sends a bank wire from his operation’s bank account to the other subsidiary’s
    bank account. These transfers are needlessly complicated and take days, sometimes
    weeks to settle. During that time, neither subsidiary can use the money to fund
    operations or investment, but the intermediaries can earn interest on the float.
    “The advent of technology essentially took paper-based processes and turned them
    into semiautomated, semielectronic processes but the logic was still paper based,”

    他们需要支付的款项微不足道，对于传统的支付网络如借记卡和信用卡来说太小，在这些网络中，最低费用使得所谓的微支付变得不可能。根据最近哈佛商学院的研究，银行根本不认为服务这些人群是一个“有利可图的提议”。[⑥](notes.xhtml#en0095en)

    the term *productivity paradox*, laying new technologies over existing infrastructure
    is “not unusual during historical transitions from one technological paradigm
    to the next.”[^(10)](notes.xhtml#en0099en) For example, manufacturers needed forty
    years to embrace commercial electrification over steam power, and often the two
    worked side by side before manufacturers finally switched over for good. During
    that period of retrofitting, productivity actually decreased. In the financial
    system, however, the problem is compounded because there has been no clean transition
    from one technology to the next; there are multiple legacy technologies, some
    hundreds of years old, never quite living up to their full potential.

- en: Why? In part, because finance is a monopoly business. In his assessment of the
    financial crisis, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz wrote that banks “were doing
    everything they could to increase transaction costs in every way possible.” He
    argued that, even at the retail level, payments for basic goods and services “should
    cost a fraction of a penny.” “Yet how much do they charge?” he wondered. “One,
    two, or three percent of the value of what is sold or more. Capital and sheer
    scale, combined with a regulatory and social license to operate allows banks to
    extract as much as they can, in country after country, especially in the United
    States, making billions of dollars of profits.”[^(11)](notes.xhtml#en0100en) Historically,
    the opportunity for large centralized intermediaries has been enormous. Not only
    traditional banks (e.g., Bank of America), but also charge card companies (Visa),
    investment banks (Goldman Sachs), stock exchanges (NYSE), clearinghouses (CME),
    wire/remittance services (Western Union), insurers (Lloyd’s), securities law firms
    (Skadden, Arps), central banks (Federal Reserve), asset managers (BlackRock),
    accountancies (Deloitte), consultancies (Accenture), and commodities traders (Vitol
    Group) make up this expansive leviathan. The gears of the financial system—powerful
    intermediaries that consolidate capital and influence and often impose monopoly
    economics—make the system work, but also slow it down, add cost, and generate
    outsized benefits for themselves. Because of their monopoly position, many incumbents
    have no incentive to improve products, increase efficiency, improve the consumer
    experience, or appeal to the next generation.

  zh: 为什么？部分原因在于金融是一个垄断行业。诺贝尔奖得主约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）在评估金融危机时写道，银行“尽其所能增加交易成本”。他认为，即使是在零售层面，基本商品和服务的支付“应该只需要花费百分之一便士”。他质疑：“然而它们收取多少呢？”“销售额的1%、2%或3%甚至更多。资本和规模，再加上监管和社会运营许可，使得银行能在一个又一个国家，特别是在美国，获取尽可能多的利润。”[^(11)](notes.xhtml#en0100en)历史上，大型集中式中介机构的机会是巨大的。不仅传统银行（例如美国银行），还有信用卡公司（维萨）、投资银行（高盛）、股票交易所（纽约证券交易所）、清算所（CME）、汇款服务（西联）、保险公司（劳埃德保险）、证券律师事务所（斯凯德恩·阿普斯）、中央银行（美联储）、资产管理公司（贝莱德）、会计师事务所（德勤）、咨询公司（麦肯锡）以及大宗商品交易商（维多集团）等构成了这个庞大的金融巨兽。金融系统的齿轮——强大的中介机构，它们集中资本和影响力，并常常实施垄断经济学——既使系统运作，又使其减速、增加成本，并为自身产生不成比例的好处。由于它们的垄断地位，许多现有企业没有改进产品、提高效率、改善消费者体验或吸引下一代消费者的动力。

    validation from the members themselves, removing the need for anonymous miners
    who use lots of electricity. Also, because all parties are trusted, a 51 percent
    attack is unlikely. Nodes can be trusted to be well connected, as in most use
    cases they are large financial institutions. Furthermore, they are easier for
    regulators to monitor. However, these advantages also create weaknesses. The easier
    it is to change the rules, the more likely a member is to flout them. Private
    blockchains also prevent the network effects that enable a technology to scale

    the fifteenth century. His deceptively simple invention was a formula known as
    double-entry accounting, where every transaction has two effects on each participant,
    that is, each must enter both a debit and a credit onto the balance sheet, the
    ledger of corporate assets and liabilities. By codifying these rules, Pacioli
    provided order to an otherwise ad hoc practice that prevented enterprises from

    not, the loan officer will base the decision on the person’s documentation, a
    one-point perspective of identity, and their credit score. Of course, a human
    being is more than the sum of a Social Security number, place of birth, primary
    residence, and credit history. However, the bank does not know, and does not care,
    whether you’re a reliable employee, an active volunteer, an engaged citizen, or

    on BTCjam to Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay, or Coinbase to add more depth and texture.
    Friends can volunteer recommendations from Facebook. You can even submit your
    actual credit score as one of many attributes. None of this private information
    is released. Users start on the platform with a low credit score. But you can
    quickly build a reputation by showing you are a reliable borrower. The best strategy
    is to start with a “reputation loan” to prove you’re reliable. As a user, you
    will have to respond to investor questions during the funding process. Ignoring
    these questions is a red flag; the community will hesitate to fund you. With your
    first loan, start with a manageable amount, and pay it back on time. Once you
    have, your quantitative score will improve, and other members in the community
    might give you a positive review. As of September 2015, BTCjam had funded eighteen

    is also a remarkable opportunity for the industry’s leaders to do something about
    it today. The financial services industry will both shrink and grow over the coming
    years; fewer intermediaries will be able to offer more products and services at
    a much lower cost to a much larger population. That’s a good thing. Whether permissioned
    and closed blockchains will find a place in a decentralized world is up for debate.

    the transaction outside the firm。[⑤](notes.xhtml#en0181en)
- en: Don argued that the Internet would reduce a firm’s internal transaction costs
    somewhat; but we thought, because of its global accessibility, it would reduce
    costs in the overall economy even more, in turn lowering barriers to entry for
    more people. Yes, it did drop search costs, through browsers and the World Wide
    Web. It also dropped coordination costs through e-mail, data processing applications
    like ERP, social networks, and cloud computing. Many companies benefited from
    outsourcing such units as customer service and accounting. Marketers engaged customers
    directly, even turning consumers into producers (prosumers). Product planners
    crowdsourced innovations. Manufacturers leveraged vast supply networks.

    full time from January through June next year? And other qualifications. These
    queries will scurry about the black boxes of people on the job market and yield

    collaboration with strangers. Contracts had to be fulfilled immediately, and there
    were no formal mechanisms for enforcement of the terms beyond what you could take
    by force. The written contract was a way of codifying an obligation, of establishing
    trust and setting expectations. Written contracts provided guidance when someone
    did not hold up his end of the bargain, or something unexpected happened. But

    open market, the only dispute mechanism is the court—costly, timely, and often
    unsatisfactory. Further, he argued that in some cases like fraud, other illegal
    acts, or conflict of interest, there is no market dispute mechanism at all. “In
    effect, the contract law of internal organization is that of forbearance, according
    to which a firm becomes its own court of ultimate appeal. Firms, for this reason,
    are able to exercise fiat that the markets cannot.”[^(15)](notes.xhtml#en0191en)
    Williamson conceived of the firm as “a governance structure” for contractual arrangements.
    He said that organizational structure matters in reducing the costs of managing
    transactions and that “recourse to the lens of contract, as against the lens of
    choice, frequently deepens our understanding of complex economic organization.”[^(16)](notes.xhtml#en0192en)

    it’s because its board of directors has agreed that it should be done. If a corporation
    hires employees, it means that the employees are agreeing to provide services
    to the corporation’s customers under a particular set of rules, particularly involving
    payment,” Buterin wrote. “When a corporation has limited liability, it means that
    specific people have been granted extra privileges to act with reduced fear of
    legal prosecution by the government—a group of people with more rights than ordinary
    people acting alone, but ultimately people nonetheless. In any case, it’s nothing

    in emergencies and reduce costs to customers while promoting clean, renewable
    electricity, energy efficiency, and storage options in the community.

    residential areas. Most home owners, businesses, governments, and other organizations
    in urban North America get their power from regulated utilities at regulated prices.
    Currently, we have more variety in locally generated renewable energy from, say,
    solar panels on rooftops. The local utility captures excess power in its supply
    for redistribution at wholesale rates, often with considerable leakage. The consumer,
    who may be located across the street from a local power source, still must go
    through the utility and pay full retail for renewable energy generated by their
    neighbor. It’s ridiculous.

    of people are actually running a utility grid, you can design the grid so that
    it runs itself,” said Lawrence Orsini, cofounder and principal of LO3 Energy.
    “The network becomes far more resilient because all of the assets in the grid
    are helping to maintain and run the utility grid.”[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0259en) It’s
    a distributed peer-to-peer IoT network model with smart contracts and other controls
    designed into the assets themselves (i.e., the blockchain model).[⁶](notes.xhtml#en0260en)
    When a hurricane destroys transmission towers or fire cripples a transformer substation,
    the grid can quickly and automatically reroute power to prevent a massive blackout.

    significantly more efficient than the utility-scale model, which relies on transmitting
    energy across vast distances, where energy is lost. LO3 Energy is working with
    local utilities, community leaders, and technology partners to create a market
    where neighbors can buy and sell the local environmental value of their energy.
    “So, instead of paying an energy services company that’s buying renewable energy
    credits, you get to pay the people who are actually generating the electricity
    that is serving your house, that is local and green, and that actually has an
    environmental impact in your neighborhood. It seems a lot fairer, right?” said
    Orsini.[⁷](notes.xhtml#en0261en) Right!

    and consumption, then you can create a real-time market. According to Orsini,
    you can auction your excess energy to your neighbors who might not be able to
    generate renewable energy. In doing so, your community can create energy resiliency
    through peer-to-peer trading. Community members can reach consensus on the rules
    of the real-time microgrid market such as time-of-day pricing, floor or ceiling
    prices, priority given to your nearest neighbor, or other parameters so as to
    optimize price and minimize leakage. You will not be sitting at your computer
    all day long setting prices, offering to buy or sell.

    We need to respond to climate change and brace ourselves for increasingly extreme
    weather conditions, particularly melting ice caps that drown islands in oceans,
    and droughts that turn dry land into desert. Currently, we’re losing about fifteen
    million acres per year to desertification, the worst losses in sub-Saharan Africa
    where, unlike the Munroes of the outback, people can’t afford water pumps, air-conditioning,
    or migration.[⁸](notes.xhtml#en0262en) We need our utility grids and our engines
    not to leach energy and carbon into our atmosphere. While the utilities are looking
    at IoT benefits to their existing infrastructure (“smart grid”), connecting microgrids
    could lead to entirely new energy models. Utility companies, their unions, regulators,
    and policy makers, as well as innovative new entrants such as LO3, are exploring
    these new models for generating, distributing, and using electricity first at
    the neighborhood level and then around the world.

    as in the earlier microgrid example? Owners will be able to tag priceless objects,
    antiquities, jewelry, the stuff of museums, anything ever handled by Sotheby’s
    and insured by Lloyd’s. Insurers could adjust payment according to where the object
    is and its environment—if it’s in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art under
    controlled climate, then a lower insurance rate; if traveling to Greece, then
    charge a higher rate. The object could tell whether it was in a vault or around
    a celebrity’s neck. Insurance rates could be higher if the device was hanging
    on Lindsay Lohan’s neck versus, say, Anne Hathaway’s. Driverless cars would surely
    have lower insurance rates, and devices themselves could settle insurance claims
    on the spot based on sensor data.

    Beach three days ahead of time that it needed a critical new part. The sensor
    could even issue an RFP and accept the best bid and delivery for the part, cutting

    in realms from cars to light bulbs to Band-Aids are investigating how they can
    embed smart chips into their products or parts thereof and monitor, collect, and

    low (e.g., no more third-party service fees). It drastically lowers the cost of
    transmitting funds and lowers the barrier to having a bank account, obtaining

    network of drivers who are willing to give other people a lift for a fee. To use
    Uber, you download the Uber app, create an account, and provide Uber with your
    credit card information. When you use the app to request a car, it asks you to
    select the type of car you want and marks your location on a map. The app will
    keep you posted on the availability and whereabouts of your prospective driver.
    At the end of the ride, Uber automatically charges your credit card. If you don’t
    want to give the default tip, then you need to change your billing settings on
    Uber’s Web site.[^(29)](notes.xhtml#en0283en) Uber Technologies, Inc., the company

    car is taking him to work, it identifies all the parking options, both public

    autonomous parking marketplace. Because John’s predetermined parameters always
    include seeking the cheapest available spot within a ten-minute walk of his destination,
    he almost always goes with his car’s first choice. The underlying parking database
    that supports the parking also contains information on parking rules for specific
    streets on different days and at different times of day, whether or not the parking
    space is covered or in the open, or whether the owner of the space has established
    a minimum price. All this runs on a distributed peer-to-peer platform—connecting
    multiple apps—so no centralized company is mediating the orders or taking part
    of the fee. There is no surge pricing and no unexpected fees.

    self-driving cars will be commonplace—probably sooner rather than later. Rather,
    the cars could be fully autonomous agents that earn their own fares, pay for their
    own fuel and repair, get their own auto insurance, negotiate liability in collisions,
    and operate (“drive”) without outside human control, except when they need to

    protocols into the blockchain to obey all traffic rules, take the most direct,
    fastest, or least expensive route, and honor their bids. The drivers’ initial
    entry and registration into the SUber system could require vehicles to register
    necessary documentation including ownership, safety inspections, and insurance,
    and the system would permanently log these records to ensure reinspection or insurance
    and permit renewals as required. Sensors could monitor the overall “health” of
    the vehicle and signal necessary repairs, make the appointment at the appropriate
    repair shop, and preorder any necessary parts. Because the vehicles are driverless,
    they’re not subject to sarcasm, cronyism, sexism, racism, or other forms of human
    discrimination or corruption. Plus, they won’t try to push their politics or line
    the dashboard with incense. All of this happens behind the scenes, between objects,
    and powered by an autonomous application. The drivers have created a blockchain
    cooperative as described in the previous chapter and they receive nearly all the
    wealth they create. The users—Melissa and John—experience only the convenience,
    with none of the hassle. What’s not to love?

    (driver and driverless) and/or on the infrastructure, such as proximity warnings
    and automated braking, as well as antitheft or prevention of unqualified or inebriated
    drivers from taking the wheel. In addition, cities will use the sensors to help
    manage the transportation infrastructure, including asset management of infrastructure

    streets with their built-in navigation and safety systems, often interacting with
    the intelligent infrastructure to find and pay for an accelerated lane, or parking,
    or to search for and find a preferred route. The ready availability, affordability,

    While all of this could, in theory, be developed, owned, operated, and managed

    forward. SUber is more likely to evolve and innovate as an open and shared transportation
    platform, with various applications developed and introduced by local entrepreneurs,
    community groups, government, and others in either a profit-making (through revenue
    earned on a fleet of driverless vans), shared co-op (a neighborhood group invests
    in ten vehicles to be reserved and shared using the SUber app), public service
    (maintaining and operating a train or express buses on high-demand routes), or

    in cooperation with technology companies and car companies looking for test beds

    Kim is the executive director of the Stellar Development Foundation, a not-for-profit
    blockchain technology organization (not to be confused with Stellar, the large
    architecture and construction firm). A Nicaraguan microfinance operation wanted
    to learn more about Stellar’s financial platform. The woefully underdeveloped
    banking industry in Nicaragua keeps most people in an inescapable cycle of poverty
    and exacerbates the plight of would-be entrepreneurs. They struggle to start new
    businesses, register titles to their land and other assets, and resolve outstanding
    claims from the Sandinista government’s mass land expropriation in the 1980s.[³](notes.xhtml#en0289en)
    Stellar’s platform would enable Nicaraguans to transfer, save, invest, borrow,
    and lend money.

    understood that access to credit was paramount to economic inclusion but believed
    that savings, the ability to store value reliably and securely, was a prerequisite
    for almost all other financial services. When Kim asked about savings, she was
    told, “Oh, savings is not a problem around here. People have pigs.”[⁴](notes.xhtml#en0290en)

    economies because financial services are not widely available and individuals
    have a tenuous right to their land. In Nicaragua that means people own pigs, and
    lots of them. Kim was surprised at first, but quickly saw the age-old logic to
    it. “You walk out of a meeting, and you look around and you see pigs are everywhere.”[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0291en)
    Livestock has long been an accepted, relatively useful form of savings. For those
    excluded from the digital economy, animals are about as liquid an asset as you
    can own, even more so if they produce milk, and they pay dividends in piglets,
    eggs, lambs, calves, and sometimes cheese.

    actually transact with anybody unless they’re right there in front of you,” Kim
    said. “You run the huge risks with your animals running away or getting sick or
    some blight coming that could actually wipe out all of your savings.”[⁶](notes.xhtml#en0292en)

    Nicaraguan fisherman, a member of a cooperative, who explained that no one fisherman
    ever has access to enough credit to outfit an entire rig. According to Kim, “they
    form fishermen crews where one person will get a loan for the net, somebody else
    will get a loan for the bait, somebody else gets a loan for the boat, somebody
    else a loan for the motor, and then they come together and they form a crew.”
    No one person is able to float his or her own venture (no pun intended) because
    access to credit is so tight. The model works, but it involves as many middlemen
    as there are fishermen.

    Anyone with the smallest of assets—say, a talent for embroidery or music, spare
    water pails, a chicken that lays eggs, a mobile phone that records data, audio,
    and images—could exchange value. The new platform also eliminates the point-of-access
    barrier. If you can access the Internet on a mobile device, then you can access
    assets with no forms to fill out and very little literacy. These are seemingly
    small but incredibly important breakthroughs. If we do this right, blockchain

    are benefiting. On one hand, the digital age is bringing limitless possibilities
    for innovation and economic progress. Corporate profits are ballooning. On the
    other hand, prosperity has stalled. Throughout modern history, individuals and
    families at the 51st percentile were on the rise. Despite depressions and upheavals,
    prosperity for these individuals, and for society as a whole, steadily increased.
    This is no longer the case. Standards of living are even declining in the developed
    world. Median wages are stagnating in OECD countries. And, according to the International
    Labour Organization, youth unemployment in most of the world is stuck at about
    20 percent. “Young people [are] nearly three times as likely as adults to be unemployed,”
    the ILO reported.[⁹](notes.xhtml#en0295en) In many developing nations, the numbers
    are significantly higher. Such unemployment is corrosive to all societies, no
    matter what their level of development. Most citizens want to contribute to their
    community. Anyone who has been jobless knows how it erodes self-esteem and well-being.
    Those with power and wealth are getting ahead, and those without are falling behind.

    “Paradox of Prosperity” coined by economists such as Gilbert Morris, has befuddled
    every policy maker in the Western world. One of the best-selling business books
    of 2014, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* by Thomas Piketty, became the #1
    best seller on the *New York Times* hardcover nonfiction list in 2014\. A tour
    de force of academic scholarship, *Capital* explains why inequality is accelerating
    and will likely continue to do so as long as the return on capital exceeds long-term
    economic growth. The rich have gotten richer because their money made them more
    money than their work did. Hence, the proliferation of new millionaires and billionaires.
    But his solution for how to stem growing social inequality, by imposing a wealth
    tax on the ones who own most of the world’s wealth, was somewhat less inspiring,
    if only because we’ve heard it before.[^(10)](notes.xhtml#en0296en) Indeed, for
    as long as capitalism has been the primary mode of production, the debate about
    how to share the fruits more equally has not moved much beyond the redistribution
    of wealth, usually through taxation of the rich and the provision of public services
    to the poor. Advocates of our current economic model point to the hundreds of
    millions of people in the developing world (mostly in Asia) who have been lifted
    out of abject poverty, but often overlook the asymmetric benefits conferred to
    the very wealthy and the widening chasm between the superrich and the rest of
    the population in those same countries. Today, the global 1 percent owns half
    the world’s wealth while 3.5 billion people earn fewer than two dollars a day.'

    8 percent.[^(11)](notes.xhtml#en0297en) The millennial generation, oft characterized
    as entrepreneurial risk takers, is doing little to buck the trend and may be contributing
    to it. A recent analysis of Federal Reserve data found that only 3.6 percent of
    American households headed by someone under thirty held a stake in a private company,

    in Latin America and a shocking 56.2 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Brazil,
    an entrepreneur has to wait almost 103 days to incorporate his company versus
    4 days in the United States and half a day in New Zealand.[^(13)](notes.xhtml#en0299en)
    Exasperated by government bloat and inefficiency, many would-be developing-world
    entrepreneurs instead choose to operate in the so-called informal economy. “There
    are a bunch of things taken for granted in the West. Property records are fine-tuned,
    for example. In the Global South, entrepreneurs would rather the government not
    know they exist. We need to make identity a profitable proposition,” said Hernando
    de Soto. For now, staying in the shadows frees these entrepreneurs from meddlesome
    and corrupt officials, but it also profoundly limits their ability to grow their
    business, limits rights, and makes “dead capital” of money that could otherwise
    be deployed more efficiently.[^(14)](notes.xhtml#en0300en) Moreover, even for

    branch, product, dollar in, and dollar out increases the value of the bank’s network.
    However, building these networks has come at a cost. Specifically, the cost of
    acquiring a profit-turning customer has only increased. If a prospect’s money
    won’t earn its keep, the bank won’t be interested in keeping it. Thus, banks have
    little economic incentive to win customers in the bottom half of the pyramid.
    According to Tyler Winklevoss, banks don’t serve most of the world and have no
    existing plans to serve them. However, new technology could remove that step.
    He said, “A lot of African countries leapfrogged the infrastructure of landline
    telecoms with cellular. They skipped that step. Blockchain will have the greatest
    impact in areas where the payment networks don’t exist or are very poor.”[^(20)](notes.xhtml#en0306en)

    where there can be fewer than 2 branches per 100,000 people.[^(21)](notes.xhtml#en0307en)

    While these requirements vary from bank to bank and state to state, you typically
    need to deposit and maintain a $100 to $500 minimum balance. You also need to
    prove your identity. Banks that do business in the States must comply with stringent
    “know your customer,” “anti–money laundering,” and “anti–terrorism financing”
    regulations.[^(22)](notes.xhtml#en0308en) And so they must do more comprehensive
    background checks on applicants before granting them an account. Ultimately, the
    bank is less interested in evaluating your character than it is in complying with
    regulatory agencies. That means a laundry list of requirements. First, you need
    a Social Security card. Don’t have one? That’s usually enough to get rejected.
    How about a photo ID like a driver’s license or passport? Don’t have one? You’re
    not opening a bank account. Let’s say you have both a Social Security card and
    photo ID. The bank, just to be safe, asks for a recent utility bill as proof of
    permanent residence or some proof of a previous bank account. If you happen to
    be new to town, or staying with family, or from an entirely *unbanked* region
    of the world, you’d likely fail some of these tests. The bank doesn’t want you
    as a customer unless it can confirm your identity based on various papered credentials.
    It’s not interested in knowing you as a well-rounded person. It’s interested in
    knowing you as a set of checked boxes. Previous attempts to streamline this process
    for immigrants and the poor, such as the New York scheme to allow people to use
    their city ID cards, have failed.[^(23)](notes.xhtml#en0309en)

    of financial identity—one not dependent upon one’s relation to a bank but rooted
    in one’s own reputation. In this new paradigm, being “banked” in the traditional
    sense is no longer a prerequisite. Instead of passing the traditional ID tests,
    individuals can create a persistent digital ID and verifiable reputation and deploy
    it, in whole or in part, in different relationships and transactions. The blockchain
    endows this digital ID with trust and access to financial services. This capability
    is unprecedented at a massive scale. Joseph Lubin of ConsenSys said, “We all have
    reputation. It just isn’t easy to use as social and economic systems are currently
    constructed. Most of it is ethereal and ephemeral. In the best case, it is fragmented
    and you have to present shallow documentation of it anew for every venture that
    requires it. In the worst case, billions of people don’t have a way of presenting
    reputation to anybody but their immediate social circle.”[^(24)](notes.xhtml#en0310en)
    It might as well be a pig or a cow. However, with the basic building blocks, people
    can construct digital identities that are not fragmented or ethereal but universal
    and standardized, with robust attestations of aspects of themselves and their
    interactions. They can share these digital IDs granularly—that is, share only
    very specific information about their identity—to facilitate more interactions
    that will likely lead to their own personal economic growth and prosperity. David

    back a microloan, they are on their way to securing more and larger loans to build
    their businesses,”[^(26)](notes.xhtml#en0312en) said Lubin. This behavior, when
    repeated, adds to the reputation score of the borrower. Combined with a global,
    frictionless payment platform, individuals and small business owners can do the
    previously impossible: pay a remote vendor for merchandise or services, thereby
    advancing their prospects in the global economy. Joyce Kim mused, “What if we

    Economic and financial fault lines often run alongside gender lines, making this

    of wealth but a redistribution of value. Wealth is how much money you have. Value
    is where you participate.”[^(29)](notes.xhtml#en0315en) Blockchain can enable
    every person to have a unique and verifiable reputation-based identity that allows
    them to participate equally in the economy. The implications of this equality
    are profound. Lubin imagines a future where the “unbanked and underbanked will
    become increasingly enfranchised as microlending services will enable investors
    across the globe to construct diverse portfolios of many microloans of which the
    usage and repayment can be tracked in full detail on the blockchain, using Balanc3’s

    can become owners of wealth through distributed ledger technology. Enabling access
    to the world’s financial markets and therefore the universe of investment opportunities,
    from conventional investments to participation in mass collaborative ventures,
    microlending schemes, blockchain IPOs, and reputation-based microlending, will
    open access to capital. Already, crowdfunding is changing the face of finance.
    In 2012, nonblockchain crowdfunding campaigns raised $2.7 billion around the world,
    an 80 percent increase over the year before. With direct peer-to-peer crowdsourced
    blockchain financings, these numbers are poised to grow manifold. Individuals
    can contribute small amounts of money through crowdfunding campaigns. Imagine
    a campaign that engages a million people each giving a dollar. Call it distributed
    ownership. Not meaningful, you say? Augur, the prediction market platform, raised
    millions of dollars in small increments from thousands around the globe. The range
    of possibilities is vast. Blockchain IPOs not only can improve the efficacy and
    efficiency of raising money, lowering the cost for the issuer, they can also be
    broadly inclusive, allowing previously unimaginable groups of burgeoning investors
    to participate. To date, the range of proposals to change income and wealth disparity
    has not reached beyond higher taxes for the wealthy on the one end, or, at its
    most extreme, outright expropriation by the state. Instead of redistributing and
    expropriating wealth, let’s imagine how blockchain can create opportunities to
    share more equally in the wealth created by society.

    housekeeper for twenty-five years. One of more than 200,000 Filipino-born people
    living in Toronto,[^(35)](notes.xhtml#en0321en) her story is fairly typical: She
    left the Philippines as a young woman to settle in Canada with no savings, no
    formal education, and very little knowledge of her adoptive country. Analie has
    worked very hard and has carved out a life for herself and her family. Ten years
    ago, she used her savings to put a down payment on a house, a remarkable feat
    as she had been dutifully sending money to her family in the Philippines for the
    previous three hundred months. Analie sent home so much money that her mother,
    now in her seventies, was able to purchase a home of her own in Manila.'

    On Friday afternoon, Analie got her paycheck, handwritten by her employer, and
    walked it to the local bank. This took fifteen minutes; twenty minutes if you
    include the lineup at the teller. After she deposited it, she withdrew $200 Canadian.
    Cold hard cash in hand, she walked a block to catch a local bus. Instead of heading
    toward her home, she went two miles in the opposite direction and got dropped
    off at what can only be described as a bad neighborhood. She walked for another
    four blocks and finally arrived at the “financial institution” from which she
    would send the money: an iRemit counter at the bottom of a housing block in Toronto’s
    St. James Town—one of the poorest and most notoriously dangerous neighborhoods
    in Canada. Because many people who use iRemit’s services are unbanked, the company
    has begun offering other financial services, such as check cashing. Analie filled
    out a paper form, as she has done hundreds of times before, and handed over her
    hard-earned money. For a $200 wire, Analie paid a flat fee of $10\. On the receiving
    end, her seventy-year-old mother endured a similarly taxing (and equally ridiculous)
    trek to receive the money. Of course, she had to wait three to four days before
    going to the bank, the average time these payments take to get processed. Analie
    walked back to the bus stop, boarded the bus, a subway, and another bus, and eventually,
    one hour later, reached her home.'

    value. In addition, there is typically a spread on the exchange rate of around
    1 to 2 percent. At around 7 percent this is a slight discount to the international
    average of 7.68 percent.[^(36)](notes.xhtml#en0322en) That they are both “banked”
    and still have to go through this process makes the whole farcical routine more
    egregious. The hard cost fails to capture the all-in cost. For example, the time
    value of the two hours Analie wasted doing this is equal to another $40, based
    on her wages. Moreover, she had to leave work early because she feels unsafe going
    to the neighborhood when it’s dark. For her mother, a septuagenarian living in
    Manila, the physical toll on her body of making the journey to pick up the money
    is equally significant. The purchasing power of the $10 Analie forwent to make
    the transaction happen is certainly material to her, but far more for her mother.
    Whereas in Canada $10 is the cost of a meal and bus fare, in Manila it could buy
    food for a week. Over her lifetime, Analie has paid *thousands* of dollars to
    intermediaries such as Western Union to send money home. Each monthly fee contributes
    to a global honeypot of $38 billion in fees paid annually on remittances.[^(37)](notes.xhtml#en0323en)

    knowledge and tools to use blockchain effectively. While cash may very well go
    the way of the dodo, until employers start beaming value to smart wallets in the

    her mom had the choice of keeping pesos on her phone as a store of value and choosing

    the conventional banking system’s two most essential roles: payments and value
    storage. This alone is a revolutionary concept, but here’s where it gets really
    interesting: Mom wants cash. She pays her rent, buys her food, and manages virtually
    all other expenses in cash. She checks the app and notices there are four other
    Abra users within a four-block radius of her. She messages them all to see who
    will exchange her digital pesos for physical pesos and at what price. The four

    this, and it is presigning tellers—at last count many thousands in the Philippines
    alone—who are ready to transact when things go live. Second, the model works on
    the assumption that tellers and customers will abide by their commitment when
    they transfer digital for physical currency. This is less of a concern. Businesses
    like Airbnb, Lending Club, and Zipcar have debunked the myth that individuals
    will not trust one another. Indeed, for Abra CEO Bill Barhydt, the staggering
    growth in the number of so-called sharing economy companies convinced him this

    “It’s amazing what people are willing to do in a shared economy model and they’re
    just not doing it for money yet, maybe with the exception of peer-to-peer lending.”
    Moreover, he said, “It’s more important to us that you trust each other rather
    than Abra. If you trust each other, it’s highly likely that you’re going to get

    donated to the Red Cross could be tracked from its starting all the way through
    the value chain to the individual it directly benefits. Recall our hypothetical

    for each of its most important initiatives—delivering medical aid and fighting
    the spread of disease, water purification, the rebuilding of homes—and when you
    donate you would know whether your dollar went to a plank of wood, a gallon of
    water, or a gauze Band-Aid. If funds went missing, the community would know and
    could hold these organizations accountable. Smart contracts could be employed
    that hold the aid groups themselves accountable. The funds for major projects—from
    housing initiatives to the implementation of a water purification scheme—could
    simply go into escrow and be released only after the successful completion of
    key milestones—securing title for a site, importing raw materials, signing a contract
    with a local supplier, building the finished product, installing a certain number

    ownership, completing and filing paperwork, cutting through red tape, resolving
    disputes, greasing the palms of officials and inspectors, and so on.[^(57)](notes.xhtml#en0343en)

    officials are known to behave without integrity. Honduras is such a place, the
    second-poorest country in Central America with an extremely unequal distribution
    of income. The economic downturn of 2008 stymied the inflow of remittances, and
    a military coup ousted the democratically elected Manuel Zelaya in 2009\. The
    coup was backed by one of the region’s largest landowners, a palm oil tycoon who

    government services and operations have a long way to go. Governments are organized
    into silos that don’t share information. Bureaucracy too often trumps common sense
    or shared practices. Citizens rarely have one-stop shopping for government services.

    issue currency or for a bank to establish trust, people won’t necessarily even
    need a government-issued identity card. Said Carlos Moreira of the cryptographic
    security company WISeKey, “Today you need an organization with endowed rights
    to provide you with an identity, like a bank card, a frequent flier card, or a
    credit card. But that identity is now yours and the data that comes from its interaction
    in the world is owned by someone else.”[^(19)](notes.xhtml#en0375en) On the blockchain,
    the individual owns the identity. Your “personal avatar” could decide what information
    is provided to whom under your command. It could also make choices about integrating

    campaign created an expansive Internet platform, [www.My.BarackObama.com](http://www.barackobama.com/),
    that gave supporters tools to organize themselves, create communities, raise money,
    and induce people not only to vote but to get involved in the Obama campaign.
    What emerged was an unprecedented force: thirteen million supporters connected
    to one another over the Internet, and self-organized to build thirty-five thousand
    communities of people with common interests. When young people chanted “Yes We

    data,” replacing “Yes We Can” with “We Know You.” It used data to swing voters
    and target supporters for funds. The campaign won the election, but relegated
    citizens to consumption of its messages. The big data strategy had fewer risks
    than a strategy of self-organizing communities.

    a historic opportunity to strengthen government legitimacy. In the end, even President
    Obama, who had been called “The First Internet President,” took the expedient
    route to power, using social media to broadcast messages and raise funds through

    earning energy credits, paying taxes and receiving public services, and seeing
    where one’s tax dollars are going and how representatives are voting. Elected

    attorney, police officer, or parliamentarian. Civil servants and government employees
    could use sensors and cameras to track public assets and inventory on the blockchain,
    prioritize infrastructure repairs, and allocate resources. If you’re a young person,
    don’t give up on democracy. It may be broken but it’s fixable. Focus on campaign
    financing as a starting place for blockchain transparency, as big money is currently
    the most fundamental problem. If you’re a government contractor, use smart contracts
    to clean up graft and waste and evidence your superior performance. The possibilities
    abound.

    It starts with a basic problem for artists—that they signed contracts drafted
    for the vinyl age, when huge analog production and distribution costs stood between
    recording artists and their potential consumers. Heap told us, “When I first found
    a record label, I think I managed to get something like fifteen percent. My last
    record deal a few years ago, I got maybe nineteen percent. If people are lucky,
    they might get more now.”[⁹](notes.xhtml#en0428en) Artists may have assigned their
    rights to a label for the full term of copyright. In the States, that’s either
    ninety-five years or the life of the artist plus seventy years. Imagine all the

    and artist and repertoire personnel not only scouted for new talent but also oversaw
    their artistic development. In the last twenty-five years, the industry has consolidated
    from thousands of labels down to three global superpowers—Sony Music Entertainment,
    Vivendi’s Universal Music, and Warner Music Group—and a few hundred indie labels.
    These three majors have a combined 15 percent stake in Spotify, the most popular
    and lucrative streaming music service.[^(10)](notes.xhtml#en0429en) So they will

    not-for-profit Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), and the enterprise formerly known

    and the studios, the venues, the concert tour organizers and promoters, the wholesalers,
    the distributors, and the agents, each with its own contract, accounting, and
    reporting system. They take their cut and pass along the remainder to the artists’
    managers and agents. Whatever’s left goes to the artists themselves, per the terms
    of their contracts. That’s right—the artist is the last to be paid. It could be
    six to eighteen months before the first royalty check arrives, depending on the

    or Spotify—inserted themselves into the supply chain between artists and labels,
    slicing the artists’ piece of the pie even thinner. Let’s look at streaming music.
    Spotify pays on average between $0.006 and $0.0084 per stream to rights holders,
    usually the labels.[^(12)](notes.xhtml#en0431en) The calculation of this initial
    payment may seem transparent at first. Spotify’s site states that it pays 70 percent
    of its advertising and subscription revenues to rights holders. But we reviewed
    its forty-one-page “Digital Audio/Video Distribution Agreement” with Sony USA
    Inc., and the payout of some $42.5 million in nonrecoupable advances to Sony artists
    is anything but clear. In fact, the first paragraph of the agreement calls for
    confidentiality. It appears that neither Spotify nor Sony can inform Sony’s artists
    of the impact of this agreement on artists’ revenues. Rich Bengloff, president
    of the American Association of Independent Music, said that, in his experience,
    the labels don’t usually share money not directly tied to usage.[^(13)](notes.xhtml#en0432en)
    Industry analyst Mark Mulligan said, “Artists are going to feel pain for at least
    another four to five years, just as they did in the first four to five years after
    iTunes launched.”[^(14)](notes.xhtml#en0433en)

    had dedicated a third of its workforce to royalty and copyright administration
    in local markets around the world.[^(15)](notes.xhtml#en0434en) Universal recently
    deployed an artist’s portal that allows artists to peek at the status of their
    royalties and to request advances against future revenues for no fee. The portal
    also provides “insights into Spotify usage: how many times a song streams, what
    kinds of people are streaming it, what else is on those listeners’ playlists,
    and how specific songs resonate with certain audiences.” Universal has devoted
    sixteen staffers to upgrading the portal and interpreting data for artists.[^(16)](notes.xhtml#en0435en)
    The labels also have huge teams of lawyers and lobbyists. They can launch new
    artists globally, demanding their boilerplate terms, marketing through local foreign
    media, distributing their music in foreign markets, licensing rights to foreign
    publishers, supporting international tours, and aggregating all the revenues.

    I can just record music in my basement and release it on the Internet,” Keating

    artists, but her experience with the big online music distributors has not differed
    greatly from Imogen Heap’s with the traditional labels. “This is not just an excuse
    for services to replicate the payment landscapes of the past. It’s not an excuse
    to take advantage of those without power,” said Keating. “Corporations do have
    a responsibility not just to their shareholders but to the world at large, and
    to artists.”[^(23)](notes.xhtml#en0442en)

    her. It was wrapped in nondisclosure. For several years, she’s distributed her
    music on YouTube and monetized third-party uploads of her material using Content
    ID, a program that automatically alerts rights holders to instances of potential
    copyright infringement. Keating wasn’t concerned about piracy, file sharing, or
    royalties. To her, commercial streaming was a means of promotion, reaching new
    audiences, and analyzing usage data. The music aggregators and the hit makers
    were the ones who made significant money by offering complete catalogs through
    on-demand services. Not her. The largest share of her revenues had always come
    from hard-core fans who’d pay from twenty dollars to a hundred for a new album.
    She would release new work on Bandcamp first, then upload it to iTunes, and finally
    make selections available elsewhere—YouTube, Spotify, Pandora. That *windowing
    strategy*—making content available exclusively in a particular channel for a period
    of time—had proven itself effective for her and her hard-core fans. She could
    thank her existing supporters and cultivate new relationships.

    right to the underlying composition—the musical notes and the lyrics—in all forms
    and languages, and that’s usually held by the composer-lyricist. The music and
    the lyrics can be copyrighted separately. The composer-lyricist makes royalties
    whenever someone records or performs the song, buys the sheet music, adapts it
    into another genre (e.g., elevator Muzak), translates it into a foreign language,
    or includes the music in an anthology or textbook. The second is the worldwide
    right to the sound recording, a performance captured and preserved in some medium
    like a digital file or music video. The recording is usually copyrighted by the
    performer or band members, who earn royalties when the recording is played on
    the radio, television, or the Internet; synced with TV shows, commercials, or
    video games; streamed, downloaded, or purchased in some hard medium such as vinyl,
    CD, or DVD.

    band 22Hertz to turn to the blockchain. In Canada, registering copyright for one
    song costs fifty loonies, and the certificate contains only the title of the work.
    The band’s founder, Ralf Muller, didn’t think that’d be helpful in court, if anyone
    ever used the lyrics or melody. So he decided to go the hashing route, by creating
    a hash of the whole song using something called an OP_RETURN feature—and encoded
    it into the blockchain instead. If anyone ever used his words or music, he could
    simply demonstrate his ownership by pointing to the transaction on the blockchain,
    doing another hash of the song, and comparing the second hash with the hash on
    the blockchain. They would be identical. “Once you encode a hash in the OP_RETURN
    and block upon block get written on top, it is basically impossible to go back
    and change anything. This, to me, is incredible.” When asked why the band’s online
    store was accepting bitcoin and offering discounts to bitcoin users, Muller responded
    emphatically, “I’m not into ‘business as usual.’ ”[^(26)](notes.xhtml#en0445en)

    Artlery’s goal is to mint an art-as-asset-backed-currency on the blockchain by

    and fairs—rather than provide perverse incentives for one party at the expense
    of the others. To foster patronage and build reputation for an artist, Artlery
    stages initial public offerings (IPOs) of digital pieces of that artist’s work.
    Artlery’s app enables artists such as JaZoN Frings, David Perea, Keith Hollander,
    Benton C Bainbridge, and the Bazaar Teens to replicate their physical works digitally,
    break them into many pieces like a picture puzzle, and apportion them to patrons
    based on each patron’s level of appreciation from within the Artlery app. During
    a work’s IPO period, patrons can accumulate interest up to the specified percentage
    of the piece that the artist initially gifted to the community. As the platform

    their processing power to solve the math problem associated with creating a block.
    As we’ve explained, the bitcoin community refers to them as *miners* and to their
    problem-solving work as *mining*, as in gold mining. It’s an awkward analogy because
    it conjures images of experts whose talent might confer some competitive advantage
    over noobs (newbies). It doesn’t. Each miner is running the software like a utility
    function in the background, and the software is doing all the computations. Serious
    miners configure their machines to optimize their processing power, minimize their
    energy consumption, and leverage high-speed network connectivity. Beyond that,
    there’s really no human aptitude necessary and no human interference tolerated.

    network are simply performing bitcoin rule verification of received data before
    routing the data to peer connections. The network verified the two bits of data—that
    Don controlled the amount of bitcoin specified and authorized the transaction—and
    recognized Don’s message as a transaction. The miners then race to convert unordered
    and unrecorded transactions into transactions ordered and recorded in a block
    of data. Each block had to include the digest or hash of the previous block of
    transactions, as well as a random number known as a *nonce*. To win the race,
    a computer must create a hash of the block; this hash must have a certain, but
    arbitrary, number of zeros at the beginning. It’s unpredictable which nonce will
    produce a hash with the correct number of zeros, and so the computers have to
    try different nonces until they stumble upon the right value. It’s really like
    winning the lottery because there’s no skill involved. However, a human being
    can increase her chance of winning the lottery by buying a state-of-the-art computer
    processor that specializes in solving bitcoin’s math problems; buying more tickets,
    that is, running multiple high-powered nodes; or, as human beings often do, pooling
    her node with other nodes—like colleagues at the office—and agreeing to split
    the pot if one of their nodes wins. So winning is a matter of luck, processing
    power, and the size of one’s mining pool.

    The higher the total aggregate hash rate of the entire network, the more difficult
    it is to find the right nonce. When a miner finds a hash with the correct number
    of zeros, it shares its proof of work with all other miners on the network. This
    is the other big scientific breakthrough in distributed computing: using proof
    of work to achieve network consensus. It’s known as the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.
    The other miners signal their acceptance of the block by focusing on assembling
    the next block, which has to include the hash of the newly made block. Just as
    Don’s public and private keys are unique to him, the hash of each block is unique:
    it works like a cryptographic fingerprint that makes all the transactions in the
    block verifiable. No two block fingerprints are the same. The winning miner receives
    a set quantity of new bitcoins as a reward—the software itself mints and allocates
    the new coins—and the hashed block is appended to the chain.'

    a confirmation that Don’s bitcoin transaction created what is referred to as “unspent

    did—broadcasting a message that specifies the amount to send and the address of
    the recipient, and authorizing the transaction with Artlery’s public key. If the
    artist and the patrons knew both Don’s and Artlery’s public keys, then they could
    see that the deal between them went through and could see the amount of the transaction.
    That’s why we call it a *public ledger*—all transactions are transparent—and pseudonymous,
    in that we can see the parties’ addresses, though we can’t see the names of the
    persons behind them. Every subsequent block served as further confirmation of
    their transaction.

    In other words, patron participation matters. Patrons who interact with the artist
    and the work, who share their appreciation in social networks, who spark others
    to engage with both artist and art, and who essentially serve to promote the artist’s
    brand, receive more than does a passive patron who viewed it once online and bought
    a stake. We’re not sure whether writing about it in this book counts directly
    toward Don’s participation points. Artlery wants signals of appreciation—in the
    form of positive references to artists and their works—to correlate with the appreciation
    in value of the work itself, and so perhaps future platform releases will take

    company like Facebook, you might have many companies tying into this common database
    [the blockchain] and participating in building their own unique user experiences.
    Some of those companies might ask you for or might require certain information
    to be shared with them so that they could monetize that. But as a user, you would
    have full control over what information you’re sharing with that company.”[^(40)](notes.xhtml#en0459en)
    There is Twister, a Twitter clone in terms of feel and functionality developed
    in 2013 by Miguel Freitas, a hacker and research engineer at PUC-Rio University
    in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Twister leverages the free software implementations
    of bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols and deploys cryptography end to end so that
    no government can spy on users’ communications.[^(41)](notes.xhtml#en0460en)

    Gates and Steve Jobs to Biz Stone and Mark Zuckerberg—who dropped out of college
    to invent something new in the digital economy.[^(42)](notes.xhtml#en0461en) It
    is a hallmark of our entrepreneurial culture that one’s pursuit of an idea, to
    go deep and understand its nuances as Ito likes to say, drives a visionary out
    of the classroom and into business. Henry Ford and Walt Disney pursued their passions
    without college degrees. And so it is one of those paradoxes that the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology would choose Ito to direct its legendary Media Lab, at
    the epicenter of all things digital and relevant to culture.

    in even before the Media Lab …. I ran one of the really early digital test servers
    from the DigiCash days in the 1990s. One of the first books I ever wrote was in
    Japanese, called *Digital Cash,* that I coauthored with someone from the Bank
    of Japan. So this has been an area of interest for me for a long time and predates
    a lot of the other stuff I’ve been doing.”[^(43)](notes.xhtml#en0462en)

    of bitcoin relative to their core discipline—consensus models, cryptography, computer
    security, distributed systems, and economics—but no one specifically focused on
    it. He didn’t see faculty doing fundamental research around bitcoin, even though
    MIT students had launched the MIT Bitcoin Project to give $100 of bitcoin to undergraduates.

    forming teams around legal, technical, and creative challenges. Blockchain technologies
    were moving much faster than Internet technologies had, but without much academic
    involvement. The core developers of the bitcoin protocols were recovering from
    reputational hits: the Bitcoin Foundation was bankrupt, and board member Mark
    Karpeles was arrested in Japan for embezzlement through his Mt. Gox exchange.
    Ito moved quickly. He launched the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) at the Media
    Lab and hired former White House adviser Brian Forde to direct it. He brought
    three of the bitcoin core developers into the DCI to provide them with stability
    and resources so they could focus on the code.'

    bitcoin was important, and that’s under way. “We’re setting up courses, we’re
    trying to organize research, but we’re still very early-stage,” he said. “We’ve
    just got the core funding together to support the program, and we’re just trying
    to drum up interest from the faculty and the students in the space.” More broadly,
    he wants the MIT Media Lab to reinvent higher education so that people like him
    won’t drop out and will see the value of a diverse place like the Lab. It’s an
    opportunity to pilot the future of academia.[^(44)](notes.xhtml#en0463en)

- en: Melanie Swan, a leading blockchain theorist and academic, was more specific
    about where to educate students about the blockchain, and it’s not in traditional
    universities. *It’s on the blockchain.* “It’s really a complete revolution in
    how we do everything. Academia is not the right place to do academic thinking
    about very new things like the blockchain,” she said. For example, rather than
    submitting research to scholarly journals for publication and waiting from six
    to eighteen months for a rejection or publication, a scholar could post the paper
    immediately as Satoshi Nakamoto did to a limited audience of peers, receive reviews
    in real time, and establish the needed credibility to publish to a larger audience.
    Reviewers could vote reviews up or down as redditors do on Reddit so that the
    scholar would know which ones to take to heart. The paper might even be available
    for free, but other scientists could subscribe to deeper analysis or threaded
    discussion with the author. The scholar could make her raw data available or share
    it with other scientists as part of a smart contract. If there was a commercial
    opportunity flowing from the paper, she could protect the rights in advance, taking
    into consideration who funded the research and any claims they might make to the
    discovery.

    of a development of an educational infrastructure to support learning about these
    technologies. Obviously, all the meetups, user groups, and hackathons are tremendously

    practice group now, and there are education institutions like Blockchain University.”[^(45)](notes.xhtml#en0464en)

    she called an “educational sommelier,” pairing interests or needed skills with
    accredited courses, potentially massive open online courses (MOOCs). “The benefit
    of MOOC is decentralized education. So I can take the top machine learning class
    from Andrew Ng at Stanford University via Coursera. I can take the top other courses
    at MIT.” So students could fund their own personal development programs anywhere
    in the world and receive accreditation. She explained: “Just as when I go take
    the GRE or the GMAT or the LSAT, I show up with my ID, it confirms locally that
    I am who I say I am, I take that test,” and that local confirmation “could easily
    be part of the MOOC infrastructure.”'

- en: 'Swan has been working on how to do MOOC accreditation and tackle student debt
    on the blockchain. The blockchain provides three elements toward this goal: (1)
    a trustable proof of truth mechanism, an oracle, to confirm that the students
    who signed up for the Coursera classes actually completed them, took the tests,
    and mastered the material; (2) a payment mechanism; and (3) smart contracts that
    could constitute learning plans. Consider smart contracts for literacy. “Why don’t
    we target financial aid toward personal development? Like Kiva, but Kiva for literacy,”
    Swan said, except that everything would be super transparent and participants
    would be accountable. Donors could sponsor individual children, put money toward
    learning goals, and pay out according to achievement. “Say I wanted to fund a
    schoolchild in Kenya’s literacy program. Every week this child would need to provide
    proof of completion of a reading module. Perhaps it’s all automated through an
    online test where the blockchain confirmed the child’s identity and recorded progress
    before disbursing the next week’s worth of funding into what we might call the
    child’s ‘smart wallet for learning’ so that the child could continue payment for
    school without interference. Money toward a girl’s education couldn’t be diverted
    to her brother’s schooling,” she said.[^(46)](notes.xhtml#en0465en)'

    and economic agreements could not—would never—maintain long-term world peace.
    Those conditions changed, sometimes frequently, sometimes drastically so. Peace
    had to be rooted in something richer, more universal, in the shared moral values
    and intellectual freedoms of society. In 1945, three dozen nations convened to
    form an educational body of sorts that would model a culture of peace. It became
    known as the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Its
    mission in the world today is “to create the conditions for dialogue among civilizations,
    cultures, and peoples.”[^(47)](notes.xhtml#en0466en)

    and educators are seeing the contours of a world that protects, cherishes, and
    rewards their efforts fairly. All of us should care. We are a species that survives
    by its ideas, not by its instincts. We all benefit when creative industries thrive
    and when the creatives themselves can make a living. Moreover, these are the bellwethers
    of our economy—they reveal faster than nearly any other industry how both producers
    and consumers will adopt and then adapt a technology to their lives. Musicians
    have long been among the first to exploit innovations for the benefit of a great
    many others, too often at their own expense. These dedicated members of our society
    inspire us, and every business executive, government official, and other organizational
    leader has much to learn from them about the new era of the digital age.
