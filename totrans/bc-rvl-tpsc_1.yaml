    of people, and supports a global economy worth more than $100 trillion.[¹](notes.xhtml#en0090en)
    It’s the world’s most powerful industry, the foundation of global capitalism,
    and its leaders are known as the Masters of the Universe. Closer up, it’s a Rube
    Goldberg contraption of uneven developments and bizarre contradictions. First,
    the machine hasn’t had an upgrade in a while. New technology has been welded onto
    aging infrastructure helter-skelter. Consider the bank offering Internet banking
    but still issuing paper checks and running mainframe computers from the 1970s.
    When one of its customers taps her credit card on a state-of-the-art card reader
    to buy a Starbucks grande latte, her money passes through no fewer than five different
    intermediaries before reaching Starbucks’s bank account. The transaction takes
    seconds to clear but days to settle.

    hundreds of bank accounts in local currencies around the world just to facilitate
    their operations.[²](notes.xhtml#en0091en) When such a corporation needs to move
    money between two subsidiaries in two different countries, the manager of one
    subsidiary sends a bank wire from his operation’s bank account to the other subsidiary’s
    bank account. These transfers are needlessly complicated and take days, sometimes
    weeks to settle. During that time, neither subsidiary can use the money to fund
    operations or investment, but the intermediaries can earn interest on the float.
    “The advent of technology essentially took paper-based processes and turned them
    into semiautomated, semielectronic processes but the logic was still paper based,”
    said Vikram Pandit, former CEO of Citigroup.[³](notes.xhtml#en0092en)

    his paycheck at a money mart for a 4 percent fee, and then walks his fistful of
    dollars over to a convenience store to wire it home to his family in Guatemala,
    where he gets dinged again on flat fees, exchange rates, and other hidden costs.
    Once his family has divvied up the sum among its many members, nobody has enough
    to open a bank account or get credit. They are among the 2.2 billion people who
    live on less than two dollars a day.[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0094en) The payments they
    need to make are tiny, too small for conventional payment networks such as debit
    and credit cards, where minimum fees make so-called micropayments impossible.

    and the compartmentalization of oversight. The global financial crisis of 2008
    was a case in point. Excess leverage, a lack of transparency, and a sense of complacency
    driven by skewed incentives prevented anyone from identifying the problem until
    it was nearly too late. “How can you have anything work, from the police force
    to a monetary system, if you don’t have numbers and locations?” pondered Hernando
    de Soto.[⁷](notes.xhtml#en0096en) Regulators are still trying to manage this machine

    the term *productivity paradox*, laying new technologies over existing infrastructure
    is “not unusual during historical transitions from one technological paradigm
    to the next.”[^(10)](notes.xhtml#en0099en) For example, manufacturers needed forty
    years to embrace commercial electrification over steam power, and often the two
    worked side by side before manufacturers finally switched over for good. During
    that period of retrofitting, productivity actually decreased. In the financial
    system, however, the problem is compounded because there has been no clean transition
    from one technology to the next; there are multiple legacy technologies, some
    hundreds of years old, never quite living up to their full potential.

    financial crisis, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz wrote that banks “were doing
    everything they could to increase transaction costs in every way possible.” He
    argued that, even at the retail level, payments for basic goods and services “should
    cost a fraction of a penny.” “Yet how much do they charge?” he wondered. “One,
    two, or three percent of the value of what is sold or more. Capital and sheer
    scale, combined with a regulatory and social license to operate allows banks to
    extract as much as they can, in country after country, especially in the United
    States, making billions of dollars of profits.”[^(11)](notes.xhtml#en0100en) Historically,
    the opportunity for large centralized intermediaries has been enormous. Not only
    traditional banks (e.g., Bank of America), but also charge card companies (Visa),
    investment banks (Goldman Sachs), stock exchanges (NYSE), clearinghouses (CME),
    wire/remittance services (Western Union), insurers (Lloyd’s), securities law firms
    (Skadden, Arps), central banks (Federal Reserve), asset managers (BlackRock),
    accountancies (Deloitte), consultancies (Accenture), and commodities traders (Vitol
    Group) make up this expansive leviathan. The gears of the financial system—powerful
    intermediaries that consolidate capital and influence and often impose monopoly
    economics—make the system work, but also slow it down, add cost, and generate
    outsized benefits for themselves. Because of their monopoly position, many incumbents
    have no incentive to improve products, increase efficiency, improve the consumer
    experience, or appeal to the next generation.

    risk*, the risk that your counterparty will default before settling a trade. The

    through the financial crisis one of the risks was, if I’m trading with somebody,

    instant settlement on the blockchain could eliminate that risk completely. Accountants
    could look into the inner workings of a company at any point in time and see which
    transactions were occurring and how the network was recording them. Irrevocability

    known as altcoins, built for something other than bitcoin payments. Others are
    looking to leverage the bitcoin blockchain’s size and liquidity to create “spin-off”
    coins on so-called sidechains that can be “colored” to represent any asset or
    liability, physical or digital—a corporate stock or bond, a barrel of oil, a bar
    of gold, a car, a car payment, a receivable or a payable, or of course a currency.
    *Sidechains* are blockchains that have different features and functions from the
    bitcoin blockchain but that leverage bitcoin’s established network and hardware
    infrastructure without diminishing its security features. Sidechains interoperate
    with the blockchain through a *two-way peg,* a cryptographic means of transferring
    assets off the blockchain and back again without a third party exchange. Others
    still are trying to remove the coin or token altogether, building trading platforms

    to establish trust and verify identity in a financial transaction. These intermediaries
    are the ultimate arbiters for access to basic financial services, such as bank
    accounts and loans. Blockchain lowers and sometimes eliminates trust altogether

    of a song on iTunes to the transfer of billions of dollars to settle an intracompany
    fund transfer, purchase an asset, or acquire a company. Blockchain can become
    the common standard for the movement of anything of value—currencies, stocks,
    bonds, and titles—in batches big and small, to distances near and far, and to
    counterparties known and unknown. Thus, blockchain can do for the movement of

    lower cost, improve speed, reduce friction, and boost economic growth and prosperity.'

    people, institutions, and governments. For the average Joe, a bank stores value
    in a safety deposit box, a savings account, or a checking account. For large institutions
    that want ready liquidity with the guarantee of a small return on their cash equivalents,
    so-called risk-free investments such as money market funds or Treasury bills will
    do the trick. Individuals need not rely on banks as the primary stores of value
    or as providers of savings and checking accounts, and institutions will have a
    more efficient mechanism to buy and hold risk-free financial assets.'

    facilitate the issuance of credit such as credit card debt, mortgages, corporate
    bonds, municipal bonds, government bonds, and asset-backed securities. The lending
    business has spawned a number of ancillary industries that perform credit checks,
    credit scores, and credit ratings. For the individual, it’s a credit score. For
    an institution, it’s a credit rating—from investment grade to junk. On the blockchain,
    anyone will be able to issue, trade, and settle traditional debt instruments directly,

    angels to IPOs and beyond. Raising money normally requires intermediaries—investment
    bankers, venture capitalists, and lawyers to name a few. The blockchain automates

    unpredictable or uncontrollable events. At last count the notional value of all
    outstanding over-the-counter derivatives is $600 trillion. Blockchain supports
    decentralized models for insurance, making the use of derivatives for risk management

    “People love the idea of not having to wait three days to settle transactions
    but having them cleared within minutes and knowing that they’re final and that
    they’re true,” said Hill. “The counterpart to that is all transactions on the
    [bitcoin] blockchain are completely public. That terrifies a number of people
    on Wall Street.” The solution? Confidential transactions on so-called permissioned
    blockchains, also known as private blockchains. Whereas the bitcoin blockchain
    is entirely open and *permissionless*—that is, anyone can access it and interact
    with it—*permissioned* blockchains require users to have certain credentials,
    giving them a license to operate on that particular blockchain. Hill has developed
    the technology whereby only a few stakeholders see the various components of a
    transaction and can ensure its integrity.

    few clear advantages. For one, its members can easily change the rules of the
    blockchain if they so desire. Costs can be kept down as transactions need only
    validation from the members themselves, removing the need for anonymous miners
    who use lots of electricity. Also, because all parties are trusted, a 51 percent
    attack is unlikely. Nodes can be trusted to be well connected, as in most use
    cases they are large financial institutions. Furthermore, they are easier for
    regulators to monitor. However, these advantages also create weaknesses. The easier
    it is to change the rules, the more likely a member is to flout them. Private
    blockchains also prevent the network effects that enable a technology to scale
    rapidly. Intentionally limiting certain freedoms by creating new rules can inhibit
    neutrality. Finally, with no open value innovation, the technology is more likely
    to stagnate and become vulnerable.[^(29)](notes.xhtml#en0118en) This is not to

    to reflect your creditworthiness and therefore your risk of default. It is the
    amalgamation of a number of inputs, from how long you’ve borrowed to your payment
    track record. Most retail credit depends on it. But the calculation is deeply
    flawed. First, it is incredibly narrow. A young person with no credit history
    might have a sterling reputation, a track record of fulfilling commitments, or
    a rich aunt. None factors into a credit score. Second, the score creates perverse
    incentives for individuals. Increasingly, people use debit cards, that is, the
    cash in their account. Because they have no credit score, they get penalized.
    Yet credit card firms encourage individuals without resources to apply for credit
    cards anyway. Third, scores are very laggy: data inputs can be outdated and have
    little relevance. A late payment at the age of twenty has little bearing on one’s

    trust in business and in everyday life. To date, financial intermediaries have
    not used reputation as the basis for establishing trust between individuals and
    banks. Consider a small business owner who wants to get a loan. More often than
    not, the loan officer will base the decision on the person’s documentation, a
    one-point perspective of identity, and their credit score. Of course, a human
    being is more than the sum of a Social Security number, place of birth, primary
    residence, and credit history. However, the bank does not know, and does not care,
    whether you’re a reliable employee, an active volunteer, an engaged citizen, or
    the coach of your kid’s soccer team. The loan officer might appreciate your acting
    with integrity, but the bank’s scoring system does not. These components of reputation

    these questions is a red flag; the community will hesitate to fund you. With your

    “While I don’t want us to implement holacracy as is—it feels way too rigid and
    structured to me—we are working to incorporate many of its philosophies in our
    structure and processes,” said Lubin. Among those holacratic tenets are “dynamic
    roles rather than traditional job descriptions; distributed, not delegated authority;
    transparent rules rather than office politics; and rapid reiterations rather than
    big reorganizations,” all of which describe how blockchain technologies work.
    How ConsenSys is structured, how it creates value, and how it manages itself differs
    not only from the industrial corporation but also from the typical dot-com.

    Firm,” Coase identified three types of costs in the economy: the costs of search
    (finding all the right information, people, resources to create something); coordination
    (getting all these people to work together efficiently); and contracting (negotiating
    the costs for labor and materials for every activity in production, keeping trade
    secrets, and policing and enforcing these agreements). He posited that a firm
    would expand until the cost of performing a transaction inside the firm exceeded
    the cost of performing the transaction outside the firm.[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0181en)'

    Web. It also dropped coordination costs through e-mail, data processing applications
    like ERP, social networks, and cloud computing. Many companies benefited from

    inventor Vitalik Buterin argues that corporate agents (i.e., executives) could
    use corporate assets only for certain purposes approved by, say, a board of directors,
    who in turn are subject to shareholder approval. “If a corporation does something,
    it’s because its board of directors has agreed that it should be done. If a corporation
    hires employees, it means that the employees are agreeing to provide services
    to the corporation’s customers under a particular set of rules, particularly involving
    payment,” Buterin wrote. “When a corporation has limited liability, it means that
    specific people have been granted extra privileges to act with reduced fear of
    legal prosecution by the government—a group of people with more rights than ordinary
    people acting alone, but ultimately people nonetheless. In any case, it’s nothing
    more than people and contracts all the way down.”[^(18)](notes.xhtml#en0194en)

    agent could sell ads back to users, ad revenue could go into a bank account or
    posted on a secure place on the blockchain, and the agent could use this growing
    revenue to crowdsource more ad content and proliferate itself. The agent would
    repeat the cycle so that appealing content propagates and hosts itself successfully,
    and unsuccessful content basically dies because it runs out of money to host itself.

    We need to respond to climate change and brace ourselves for increasingly extreme

    Uber, you download the Uber app, create an account, and provide Uber with your
    credit card information. When you use the app to request a car, it asks you to
    select the type of car you want and marks your location on a map. The app will
    keep you posted on the availability and whereabouts of your prospective driver.
    At the end of the ride, Uber automatically charges your credit card. If you don’t
    want to give the default tip, then you need to change your billing settings on
    Uber’s Web site.[^(29)](notes.xhtml#en0283en) Uber Technologies, Inc., the company

    car is taking him to work, it identifies all the parking options, both public

    autonomous parking marketplace. Because John’s predetermined parameters always
    include seeking the cheapest available spot within a ten-minute walk of his destination,
    he almost always goes with his car’s first choice. The underlying parking database
    that supports the parking also contains information on parking rules for specific
    streets on different days and at different times of day, whether or not the parking
    space is covered or in the open, or whether the owner of the space has established
    a minimum price. All this runs on a distributed peer-to-peer platform—connecting
    multiple apps—so no centralized company is mediating the orders or taking part
    of the fee. There is no surge pricing and no unexpected fees.

    self-driving cars will be commonplace—probably sooner rather than later. Rather,
    the cars could be fully autonomous agents that earn their own fares, pay for their
    own fuel and repair, get their own auto insurance, negotiate liability in collisions,
    and operate (“drive”) without outside human control, except when they need to
    take some entity—maybe a human being—to court.

    protocols into the blockchain to obey all traffic rules, take the most direct,
    fastest, or least expensive route, and honor their bids. The drivers’ initial
    entry and registration into the SUber system could require vehicles to register
    necessary documentation including ownership, safety inspections, and insurance,
    and the system would permanently log these records to ensure reinspection or insurance
    and permit renewals as required. Sensors could monitor the overall “health” of
    the vehicle and signal necessary repairs, make the appointment at the appropriate
    repair shop, and preorder any necessary parts. Because the vehicles are driverless,
    they’re not subject to sarcasm, cronyism, sexism, racism, or other forms of human
    discrimination or corruption. Plus, they won’t try to push their politics or line
    the dashboard with incense. All of this happens behind the scenes, between objects,
    and powered by an autonomous application. The drivers have created a blockchain
    cooperative as described in the previous chapter and they receive nearly all the
    wealth they create. The users—Melissa and John—experience only the convenience,

    (driver and driverless) and/or on the infrastructure, such as proximity warnings
    and automated braking, as well as antitheft or prevention of unqualified or inebriated
    drivers from taking the wheel. In addition, cities will use the sensors to help
    manage the transportation infrastructure, including asset management of infrastructure

    the intelligent infrastructure to find and pay for an accelerated lane, or parking,
    or to search for and find a preferred route. The ready availability, affordability,

    While all of this could, in theory, be developed, owned, operated, and managed

    forward. SUber is more likely to evolve and innovate as an open and shared transportation
    platform, with various applications developed and introduced by local entrepreneurs,
    community groups, government, and others in either a profit-making (through revenue
    earned on a fleet of driverless vans), shared co-op (a neighborhood group invests
    in ten vehicles to be reserved and shared using the SUber app), public service
    (maintaining and operating a train or express buses on high-demand routes), or
    social enterprise (not-for-profits investing in SUber “points,” which their clients

    in cooperation with technology companies and car companies looking for test beds
    for their applications. Any scenario involving driverless vehicles would be less

    Livestock has long been an accepted, relatively useful form of savings. For those

    actually transact with anybody unless they’re right there in front of you,” Kim

    form fishermen crews where one person will get a loan for the net, somebody else
    will get a loan for the bait, somebody else gets a loan for the boat, somebody
    else a loan for the motor, and then they come together and they form a crew.”
    No one person is able to float his or her own venture (no pun intended) because

    “Paradox of Prosperity” coined by economists such as Gilbert Morris, has befuddled
    every policy maker in the Western world. One of the best-selling business books
    of 2014, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* by Thomas Piketty, became the #1
    best seller on the *New York Times* hardcover nonfiction list in 2014\. A tour
    de force of academic scholarship, *Capital* explains why inequality is accelerating
    and will likely continue to do so as long as the return on capital exceeds long-term
    economic growth. The rich have gotten richer because their money made them more
    money than their work did. Hence, the proliferation of new millionaires and billionaires.
    But his solution for how to stem growing social inequality, by imposing a wealth
    tax on the ones who own most of the world’s wealth, was somewhat less inspiring,
    if only because we’ve heard it before.[^(10)](notes.xhtml#en0296en) Indeed, for
    as long as capitalism has been the primary mode of production, the debate about
    how to share the fruits more equally has not moved much beyond the redistribution
    of wealth, usually through taxation of the rich and the provision of public services
    to the poor. Advocates of our current economic model point to the hundreds of
    millions of people in the developing world (mostly in Asia) who have been lifted
    out of abject poverty, but often overlook the asymmetric benefits conferred to
    the very wealthy and the widening chasm between the superrich and the rest of
    the population in those same countries. Today, the global 1 percent owns half
    the world’s wealth while 3.5 billion people earn fewer than two dollars a day.'

    superrich got rich by creating companies, not through inheritance. However, behind
    the successes of a few are some very troubling statistics. The rate of new business
    formation is down. In the United States, the share of total firms that are younger
    than one year old fell by nearly half between 1978 and 2011, from 15 percent to
    8 percent.[^(11)](notes.xhtml#en0297en) The millennial generation, oft characterized
    as entrepreneurial risk takers, is doing little to buck the trend and may be contributing
    to it. A recent analysis of Federal Reserve data found that only 3.6 percent of
    American households headed by someone under thirty held a stake in a private company,
    down from 10.6 percent in 1989.[^(12)](notes.xhtml#en0298en)

    entrepreneurial path of red tape and corruption. Where it costs only 3.4 percent
    of per-capita income to start a business in OECD countries, it costs 31.4 percent
    in Latin America and a shocking 56.2 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Brazil,
    an entrepreneur has to wait almost 103 days to incorporate his company versus
    4 days in the United States and half a day in New Zealand.[^(13)](notes.xhtml#en0299en)
    Exasperated by government bloat and inefficiency, many would-be developing-world
    entrepreneurs instead choose to operate in the so-called informal economy. “There
    are a bunch of things taken for granted in the West. Property records are fine-tuned,
    for example. In the Global South, entrepreneurs would rather the government not
    know they exist. We need to make identity a profitable proposition,” said Hernando
    de Soto. For now, staying in the shadows frees these entrepreneurs from meddlesome
    and corrupt officials, but it also profoundly limits their ability to grow their
    business, limits rights, and makes “dead capital” of money that could otherwise
    be deployed more efficiently.[^(14)](notes.xhtml#en0300en) Moreover, even for
    those who operate their businesses in the open, laws of many countries do not
    provide for limited liability. If your business fails, you’re personally on the
    hook for all liabilities. If you bounce a business check in many Arab countries,
    you go straight to jail—“do not pass go” or any other institutions of due process
    on the way.[^(15)](notes.xhtml#en0301en)

    branch, product, dollar in, and dollar out increases the value of the bank’s network.
    However, building these networks has come at a cost. Specifically, the cost of
    acquiring a profit-turning customer has only increased. If a prospect’s money
    won’t earn its keep, the bank won’t be interested in keeping it. Thus, banks have
    little economic incentive to win customers in the bottom half of the pyramid.
    According to Tyler Winklevoss, banks don’t serve most of the world and have no
    existing plans to serve them. However, new technology could remove that step.
    He said, “A lot of African countries leapfrogged the infrastructure of landline
    telecoms with cellular. They skipped that step. Blockchain will have the greatest
    impact in areas where the payment networks don’t exist or are very poor.”[^(20)](notes.xhtml#en0306en)

    are only 7 bank branches per 100,000 people compared with 34 per 100,000 in the

    where there can be fewer than 2 branches per 100,000 people.[^(21)](notes.xhtml#en0307en)
    So you will probably have to travel a good distance to find a bank. You will also

    While these requirements vary from bank to bank and state to state, you typically
    need to deposit and maintain a $100 to $500 minimum balance. You also need to
    prove your identity. Banks that do business in the States must comply with stringent
    “know your customer,” “anti–money laundering,” and “anti–terrorism financing”
    regulations.[^(22)](notes.xhtml#en0308en) And so they must do more comprehensive
    background checks on applicants before granting them an account. Ultimately, the
    bank is less interested in evaluating your character than it is in complying with
    regulatory agencies. That means a laundry list of requirements. First, you need
    a Social Security card. Don’t have one? That’s usually enough to get rejected.
    How about a photo ID like a driver’s license or passport? Don’t have one? You’re
    not opening a bank account. Let’s say you have both a Social Security card and
    photo ID. The bank, just to be safe, asks for a recent utility bill as proof of
    permanent residence or some proof of a previous bank account. If you happen to
    be new to town, or staying with family, or from an entirely *unbanked* region
    of the world, you’d likely fail some of these tests. The bank doesn’t want you
    as a customer unless it can confirm your identity based on various papered credentials.
    It’s not interested in knowing you as a well-rounded person. It’s interested in
    knowing you as a set of checked boxes. Previous attempts to streamline this process
    for immigrants and the poor, such as the New York scheme to allow people to use
    their city ID cards, have failed.[^(23)](notes.xhtml#en0309en)

    of financial identity—one not dependent upon one’s relation to a bank but rooted
    in one’s own reputation. In this new paradigm, being “banked” in the traditional
    sense is no longer a prerequisite. Instead of passing the traditional ID tests,
    individuals can create a persistent digital ID and verifiable reputation and deploy
    it, in whole or in part, in different relationships and transactions. The blockchain
    endows this digital ID with trust and access to financial services. This capability
    is unprecedented at a massive scale. Joseph Lubin of ConsenSys said, “We all have
    reputation. It just isn’t easy to use as social and economic systems are currently
    constructed. Most of it is ethereal and ephemeral. In the best case, it is fragmented
    and you have to present shallow documentation of it anew for every venture that
    requires it. In the worst case, billions of people don’t have a way of presenting
    reputation to anybody but their immediate social circle.”[^(24)](notes.xhtml#en0310en)
    It might as well be a pig or a cow. However, with the basic building blocks, people
    can construct digital identities that are not fragmented or ethereal but universal
    and standardized, with robust attestations of aspects of themselves and their
    interactions. They can share these digital IDs granularly—that is, share only
    very specific information about their identity—to facilitate more interactions
    that will likely lead to their own personal economic growth and prosperity. David
    Birch, a cryptographer and blockchain theorist, summed it up: “Identity is the

    back a microloan, they are on their way to securing more and larger loans to build
    their businesses,”[^(26)](notes.xhtml#en0312en) said Lubin. This behavior, when
    repeated, adds to the reputation score of the borrower. Combined with a global,
    frictionless payment platform, individuals and small business owners can do the
    previously impossible: pay a remote vendor for merchandise or services, thereby
    advancing their prospects in the global economy. Joyce Kim mused, “What if we

    Economic and financial fault lines often run alongside gender lines, making this
    technology a boon for the world’s disenfranchised women. Referring to the global
    poor, de Soto said, “It’s not that they don’t want to come into the global economy.
    It’s that the standards and information to bring them into the system are not

    is where you participate.”[^(29)](notes.xhtml#en0315en) Blockchain can enable
    every person to have a unique and verifiable reputation-based identity that allows
    them to participate equally in the economy. The implications of this equality
    are profound. Lubin imagines a future where the “unbanked and underbanked will
    become increasingly enfranchised as microlending services will enable investors
    across the globe to construct diverse portfolios of many microloans of which the
    usage and repayment can be tracked in full detail on the blockchain, using Balanc3’s
    [a ConsenSys portfolio company] triple-entry accounting system, for instance.”[^(30)](notes.xhtml#en0316en)

    Cold hard cash in hand, she walked a block to catch a local bus. Instead of heading

    off at what can only be described as a bad neighborhood. She walked for another
    four blocks and finally arrived at the “financial institution” from which she
    would send the money: an iRemit counter at the bottom of a housing block in Toronto’s
    St. James Town—one of the poorest and most notoriously dangerous neighborhoods
    in Canada. Because many people who use iRemit’s services are unbanked, the company
    has begun offering other financial services, such as check cashing. Analie filled
    out a paper form, as she has done hundreds of times before, and handed over her
    hard-earned money. For a $200 wire, Analie paid a flat fee of $10\. On the receiving
    end, her seventy-year-old mother endured a similarly taxing (and equally ridiculous)
    trek to receive the money. Of course, she had to wait three to four days before

    or the United States. But every Thursday and Friday around five o’clock in the
    evening, something entirely different happens. Paychecks in hand, thousands of
    foreign-born Canadians descend on the mall to send remittances from the mall’s
    various banks and foreign exchange dealers to needy family members in their home
    countries. A cottage industry of foreign exchange dealers and Western Union outposts
    has popped up in convenience stores, bars, and restaurants in the surrounding
    area to deal with the overflow.

    bright spots. Remember, most of the people waiting in line were using smart phones,
    a technology that is pervasive in Canada and increasingly ubiquitous globally.
    Seventy-three percent of Canadians own a smart phone, and in Toronto the number
    is almost certainly higher. The country has a wireless network infrastructure
    among the best in the world, which means that not only can most Canadians own
    a smart phone (effectively a supercomputer), but they can also use it to harness
    the power of the mobile Web in ways that would have seemed like science fiction
    two decades ago. Why do those people wait in line to send money via a physical
    point of sale using decades-old technology instead of what they have at their
    fingertips? Dollars are a lot less data intensive than HD video. In fact, according
    to Skype, video calling consumes 500 kilobits per second.[^(43)](notes.xhtml#en0329en)
    Sending one bitcoin takes about 500 bits, or roughly one one-thousandth the data
    consumption of one *second* of video Skype!

    her mom had the choice of keeping pesos on her phone as a store of value and choosing
    to spend them at a growing number of merchants that now accept Abra as a payment
    system. By creating a payment mechanism and store of value, Abra effectively displaces
    the conventional banking system’s two most essential roles: payments and value
    storage. This alone is a revolutionary concept, but here’s where it gets really
    interesting: Mom wants cash. She pays her rent, buys her food, and manages virtually
    all other expenses in cash. She checks the app and notices there are four other
    Abra users within a four-block radius of her. She messages them all to see who
    will exchange her digital pesos for physical pesos and at what price. The four

    it for 3 percent, another for 2 percent, and two more for 1.5 percent. Mom decides
    to go with the teller offering 2 percent—not because it’s the cheapest but because
    this teller has a five-star rating and has agreed to meet her halfway. They meet

    the assumption that tellers and customers will abide by their commitment when
    they transfer digital for physical currency. This is less of a concern. Businesses
    like Airbnb, Lending Club, and Zipcar have debunked the myth that individuals
    will not trust one another. Indeed, for Abra CEO Bill Barhydt, the staggering

    Anyone may request a ballot, but it will not be counted, and will appear indistinguishable
    to its valid counterparts to all but the requesting voter. These can be sold to
    a vote buyer, but they would never know if that vote counted. As these votes are
    believed more likely to be sold than their countable counterparts, it makes coercion
    impractically costly. David Chaum, inventor of the concept, said random-sample

    music on YouTube and monetized third-party uploads of her material using Content
    ID, a program that automatically alerts rights holders to instances of potential
    copyright infringement. Keating wasn’t concerned about piracy, file sharing, or
    royalties. To her, commercial streaming was a means of promotion, reaching new
    audiences, and analyzing usage data. The music aggregators and the hit makers
    were the ones who made significant money by offering complete catalogs through
    on-demand services. Not her. The largest share of her revenues had always come
    from hard-core fans who’d pay from twenty dollars to a hundred for a new album.
    She would release new work on Bandcamp first, then upload it to iTunes, and finally
    make selections available elsewhere—YouTube, Spotify, Pandora. That *windowing
    strategy*—making content available exclusively in a particular channel for a period

    the lyrics can be copyrighted separately. The composer-lyricist makes royalties
    whenever someone records or performs the song, buys the sheet music, adapts it
    into another genre (e.g., elevator Muzak), translates it into a foreign language,
    or includes the music in an anthology or textbook. The second is the worldwide
    right to the sound recording, a performance captured and preserved in some medium
    like a digital file or music video. The recording is usually copyrighted by the
    performer or band members, who earn royalties when the recording is played on
    the radio, television, or the Internet; synced with TV shows, commercials, or
    video games; streamed, downloaded, or purchased in some hard medium such as vinyl,

    band 22Hertz to turn to the blockchain. In Canada, registering copyright for one
    song costs fifty loonies, and the certificate contains only the title of the work.
    The band’s founder, Ralf Muller, didn’t think that’d be helpful in court, if anyone
    ever used the lyrics or melody. So he decided to go the hashing route, by creating
    a hash of the whole song using something called an OP_RETURN feature—and encoded
    it into the blockchain instead. If anyone ever used his words or music, he could
    simply demonstrate his ownership by pointing to the transaction on the blockchain,
    doing another hash of the song, and comparing the second hash with the hash on
    the blockchain. They would be identical. “Once you encode a hash in the OP_RETURN
    and block upon block get written on top, it is basically impossible to go back
    and change anything. This, to me, is incredible.” When asked why the band’s online
    store was accepting bitcoin and offering discounts to bitcoin users, Muller responded

    their processing power to solve the math problem associated with creating a block.
    As we’ve explained, the bitcoin community refers to them as *miners* and to their
    problem-solving work as *mining*, as in gold mining. It’s an awkward analogy because
    it conjures images of experts whose talent might confer some competitive advantage
    over noobs (newbies). It doesn’t. Each miner is running the software like a utility
    function in the background, and the software is doing all the computations. Serious
    miners configure their machines to optimize their processing power, minimize their
    energy consumption, and leverage high-speed network connectivity. Beyond that,
    there’s really no human aptitude necessary and no human interference tolerated.

    network are simply performing bitcoin rule verification of received data before
    routing the data to peer connections. The network verified the two bits of data—that
    Don controlled the amount of bitcoin specified and authorized the transaction—and
    recognized Don’s message as a transaction. The miners then race to convert unordered
    and unrecorded transactions into transactions ordered and recorded in a block
    of data. Each block had to include the digest or hash of the previous block of
    transactions, as well as a random number known as a *nonce*. To win the race,
    a computer must create a hash of the block; this hash must have a certain, but
    arbitrary, number of zeros at the beginning. It’s unpredictable which nonce will
    produce a hash with the correct number of zeros, and so the computers have to
    try different nonces until they stumble upon the right value. It’s really like
    winning the lottery because there’s no skill involved. However, a human being
    can increase her chance of winning the lottery by buying a state-of-the-art computer
    processor that specializes in solving bitcoin’s math problems; buying more tickets,
    that is, running multiple high-powered nodes; or, as human beings often do, pooling
    her node with other nodes—like colleagues at the office—and agreeing to split
    the pot if one of their nodes wins. So winning is a matter of luck, processing
    power, and the size of one’s mining pool.

    The higher the total aggregate hash rate of the entire network, the more difficult
    it is to find the right nonce. When a miner finds a hash with the correct number
    of zeros, it shares its proof of work with all other miners on the network. This
    is the other big scientific breakthrough in distributed computing: using proof
    of work to achieve network consensus. It’s known as the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.
    The other miners signal their acceptance of the block by focusing on assembling
    the next block, which has to include the hash of the newly made block. Just as
    Don’s public and private keys are unique to him, the hash of each block is unique:
    it works like a cryptographic fingerprint that makes all the transactions in the
    block verifiable. No two block fingerprints are the same. The winning miner receives
    a set quantity of new bitcoins as a reward—the software itself mints and allocates
    the new coins—and the hashed block is appended to the chain.'

    to engage with both artist and art, and who essentially serve to promote the artist’s
    brand, receive more than does a passive patron who viewed it once online and bought
    a stake. We’re not sure whether writing about it in this book counts directly
    toward Don’s participation points. Artlery wants signals of appreciation—in the
    form of positive references to artists and their works—to correlate with the appreciation
    in value of the work itself, and so perhaps future platform releases will take
    examples like ours into account. Artlery is initially concentrating on gifting
    a percentage of each piece’s sale. Future releases of the platform will allow
    patrons to purchase ownership stakes in artwork directly, perhaps sharing portions
    of subscription royalty revenue or copyright licensing of the work.

    engaging them as stakeholders, Artlery is focusing more eyes on accounting. The
    blockchain as a public, distributed ledger ensures open, accurate, and timely
    processing of transactions. As payouts expand beyond first sale, secondary sale,
    and subsidiary rights such as prints and merchandising, individual artists will
    never be acting alone. They will have a community of patron stakeholders behind
    them to negotiate and enforce their contractual rights.

    the provenance of the art as metadata on the blockchain through a partnership
    and API integration with another bitcoin start-up, Ascribe.io, and it uploads
    the payout table so that all stakeholders are paid immediately according to their
    asset shares with immediate transparency for all parties. It is exploring various
    techniques for encoding this information, such as a bitcoin script inside transactions.
    While its initial target market is fine art, Artlery has significant traction
    in other copyright industries such as music, books, and movies, which it will
    target through the release of its own API.

    and anonymously. On the other hand, they must be able to speak freely and securely
    without fear of repercussion. Online censorship, the hacking of large institutions
    and civil society, and Edward Snowden’s revelations of mass and targeted surveillance
    and data fracking have driven citizens of well-established democracies to seek
    anonymity and encryption technologies. These tools enable them to disguise their
    identities and scramble their messages in transit and in storage so that only

    captured technologies like the Internet to silence dissidents and block outside
    media will find blockchain technology significantly more challenging for several
    reasons. First, citizens and journalists could use public key infrastructure to
    encrypt information and conceal their identities from would-be censors and attackers.
    Second, where governments discourage and deprive good and honest journalism of
    funding, journalists could raise funds on the blockchain, casting a wider net
    for investors sympathetic to their cause, especially investors who preferred to
    remain anonymous. Finally, governments could not destroy or alter information

    submitting research to scholarly journals for publication and waiting from six
    to eighteen months for a rejection or publication, a scholar could post the paper
    immediately as Satoshi Nakamoto did to a limited audience of peers, receive reviews
    in real time, and establish the needed credibility to publish to a larger audience.
    Reviewers could vote reviews up or down as redditors do on Reddit so that the
    scholar would know which ones to take to heart. The paper might even be available
    for free, but other scientists could subscribe to deeper analysis or threaded
    discussion with the author. The scholar could make her raw data available or share
    it with other scientists as part of a smart contract. If there was a commercial
    opportunity flowing from the paper, she could protect the rights in advance, taking
    into consideration who funded the research and any claims they might make to the

    Swan said, except that everything would be super transparent and participants
    would be accountable. Donors could sponsor individual children, put money toward
    learning goals, and pay out according to achievement. “Say I wanted to fund a
    schoolchild in Kenya’s literacy program. Every week this child would need to provide
    proof of completion of a reading module. Perhaps it’s all automated through an
    online test where the blockchain confirmed the child’s identity and recorded progress
    before disbursing the next week’s worth of funding into what we might call the
    child’s ‘smart wallet for learning’ so that the child could continue payment for
