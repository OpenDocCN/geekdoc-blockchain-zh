- en: The overall challenge in building more resilient applications that are better
    equipped to protect against threats is a decision that needs to address exposure
    coupled with risk. The general consensus is that no system can be 100% protected
    and that this requires important decisions when analysts are designing applications
    and systems. Indeed, security access is not just limited to getting into the system,
    rather on the individual application level as well. How then do analysts participate
    in the process of designing secure applications through good design? We know that
    many cyber security architectures are designed from the office of the chief information
    security officer or CISO, a new and emerging role in organizations. The CISO role,
    often independent of the CIO (chief information officer) became significant as
    a result of the early threats from the Internet, the 9/11 attacks and most recently
    the abundant number of system compromises experienced by companies such as JP
    Morgan Chase, SONY, Home Depot and Target to name just a few.

    address third-party vendor products that are part of the supply-chain of automation
    used by firms, not to mention access to legacy applications that likely do not
    have the necessary securities built into the architecture of these older, less
    resilient technologies. This challenge has established the need for an enterprise
    cyber security solution that addresses the need of the entire organization. This
    approach would then target third-party vendor design and compliance. Thus, cyber
    security architecture requires integration with a firm’s Software Development
    Life Cycle (SDLC), particularly within steps that include strategic design, engineering,
    and operations. The objective is to use a framework that works with all of these
    components.

    S-Curve and its relationship to the risk in accuracy when determining requirements
    sources. The S-Curve also needs to be considered in the design of the cyber security
    architecture. When designing against cyber security attacks, as stated above,
    there is no 100% protection assurance. Thus, risks must be factored into the decision-making
    process. A number of security experts often ask business executives the question,
    “how much security do you want, and what are you willing to spend to achieve that
    security?”

    decomposition. The concept of decomposition is very relevant to the architecture
    of systems that guard against attacks. Simply put, integrating security at the
    functional decomposed levels of applications can improve protection. However,
    security at this level does not negate threat exposure, but will reduce risk.
    Figure [9.1](#Fig1) shows a scheme of how security is implemented at all levels
    during the decomposition process.![../images/480347_1_En_9_Chapter/480347_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_9_Chapter/480347_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.png)

    routines exist at multiple layers including the front-end interface, applications,
    and databases. The reason for this level of security is to provide the maximum
    amount of resistant to the ways threats enter a system. Indeed, once a virus enters
    it can find its way through many parts of the system—that is, entry points serve
    as gateways into the environment. Some of these points of potential entry could
    require special third-party applications, but these decisions should be discussed
    with the cyber security team. The analyst must continue to stay focused on the
    logical view of the system.
  prefs: []

    of threat potentials. The number of security interfaces at each level as well
    as the extent of the security needed will depend on the amount of risk and associated
    costs to implement. Important considerations prior to determine the levels of
    security is always the impact it might have on the user interface and on overall
    performance of the system.

- en: Schoenfield ([2015](#CR2)) suggests that someone in the organization is assigned
    the role of the “risk owner.” There may be many risk owners and as a result this
    role could have complex effects on the way systems are designed. For example,
    the top risk owner in most organizations today is associated with the CISO, or
    cyber security information systems officer. However, many firms also employ a
    CRO or chief risk officer. This role’s responsibilities vary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But risk analysis at the application design level requires different governance.
    Application security risk needs involvement from the business and the consumer
    and integrated within the risk standards of the firm. Specifically, multiple levels
    of security often require users to re-enter secure information. While this may
    maximize safety, it can negatively impact the user experience and the robustness
    of the system interface in general. Performance can obviously also be sacrificed
    given the multiple layers of validation. There is no quick answer to this dilemma
    other than the reality that more security checkpoints will reduce user and consumer
    satisfaction unless cyber security algorithms become more invisible and sophisticated.
    However, even this approach would likely reduce protection. As with all analysts,
    design challenges the IT team, business users, and now the consumer must all be
    part of the decisions on how much security is required especially in the 5G and
    IoT era.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps one of the most significant challenges in analysis today is its role
    in the software life cycle. There has been much criticism of the lack of discipline
    applied to software development projects and personnel in general, and we continue
    to be an industry that has a poor reputation for delivering quality products on
    schedule. This is even more evident with the exposures to cyber security attacks
    as articulated above. Although many organizations have procedures, few really
    follow them and fewer still have any means of measuring the quality and productivity
    of software development. A system of procedures should first be developed prior
    to implementing a life cycle that can ensure its adherence to the procedure. These
    procedures also need to be measured on an ongoing basis. This book restricts its
    focus to the set of procedures that should be employed in the analysis and design
    functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of developing measurable procedures in an organization must start
    with the people who will be part of its implementation. Standard procedures should
    not be created by upper management, as the steps will be viewed as a control mechanism
    as opposed to a quality implementation. How then do we get the implementers to
    create the standards? When examining this question, one must look at other professions
    and see how they implement their standards. The first main difference between
    computer professionals and members of many other professions is they lack a governing
    standards board like the American Medical Association (AMA) or the American Institute
    of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Unfortunately, as mentioned in previous
    chapters, it seems unlikely that any such governing board will exist in the near
    future. Looking more closely at this issue, however, we need to examine the ultimate
    value of a governing board. What standards boards really accomplish is to build
    the moral and professional responsibilities of their trade. Accountants, attorneys
    and doctors look upon themselves as professionals who have such responsibilities.
    This is not to imply that governing boards can resolve every problem, but at least
    they can help. With or without the existence of a standards board, analysts within
    an organization must develop the belief that they belong to a profession. Once
    this identification occurs, analysts can create the procedures necessary to ensure
    the quality of their own profession. There simply are not many analysts who view
    themselves as part of a profession.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If analysts can create this level of self-actualization, then the group can
    begin the process of developing quality procedures that can be measured for future
    improvement. The standard procedures should be governed by the group itself and
    the processes integrated into the software life cycle of the organization. In
    fact, analysts should encourage other departments to follow the same procedures
    for implementing their respective quality procedures.

    surround the security of pairing devices, encryption of links, registration and
    authentication of the device, updating of secrets, keys, and sensitive information
    in general. Thus, IoT with all of its advantages creates a unique set of challenges
    for security. While cyber security issues may vary in different geographies and
    industries, IoT’s most significant security exposure relates to its decentralized
    architecture. Furthermore, since IoT is device-based, many of the cyber issues
    are in the hands of third-party vendors who build and support these devices. The
    result is that IoT is forcing companies to develop new security strategies. This
    security challenge is yet another activity for the analyst.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, there are no standards for securing IoT. This is especially disturbing
    given that public and private clouds operate over different sectors and countries.
    Certainly, another area of concern is how to tie in IoT security with legacy systems.
    A number of organizations have considered “retrofitting” which integrates old
    systems with new mobile-based architecture. Indeed, retrofitting is attractive
    given the alternative costs to build new systems. But keeping the old systems
    ultimately increases security exposure so companies need to assess the risks and
    explore all options.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, one benefit of IoT decentralization is that it creates more loosely
    coupled systems that because of their independence reduce the likelihood of complete
    system failures. So, organizations within an IoT environment may only be faced
    with partial failures. Further, because of the redundancy that is built into IoT
    and blockchain architecture, analysts may actually have more alternative failover
    capabilities. This is also evident in Chap. [8](480347_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml) where
    I provided the number of cloud architectures, many of which are built to support
    partial failovers that are not just focused on system failures from power or hardware
    failures, but also against cyber security attacks.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to comply with the documentation standards, each form should contain
    an instruction sheet (as shown below). This sheet will ensure that users have
    the appropriate instructions. Confirmation documents can be implemented in different
    ways. Obviously if forms are processed manually, the documentation will contain
    the actual storage of working papers by project. Such working papers are typically
    filed in a documentation storage room similar to a library where the original
    contents are secure and controlled. Access to the documentation is allowed, but
    must be authorized and recorded. Sometimes forms are put together using a word-processing
    package such as Microsoft Word. The blank forms are stored on a central library
    so that master documents can be accessed by the analyst via a network. Once the
    forms are completed, they can be stored in a project directory. The most sophisticated
    method of implementing ISO 9000 is to use a Lotus Notes type electronic filing
    system. Here, forms are filled out and passed to the appropriate individuals automatically.
    The confirmation documents then become an inherent part of the original work flow.
    In any event, these types of forms implementation affect only automation, not
    the concept of ISO 9000 as a whole as shown in Fig. [9.6](#Fig6).![../images/480347_1_En_9_Chapter/480347_1_En_9_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_9_Chapter/480347_1_En_9_Fig6_HTML.png)

- en: We mentioned earlier that ISO 9000 requires qualified personnel. This means
    that the organization must provide detailed information about the skill set requirements
    for each job function. Most organizations typically have job descriptions that
    are not very detailed and tend to be vague with respect to the specific requirements
    of the job. In addition, job descriptions rarely provide information that can
    be used to measure true performance. Questions such as “How many lines of code
    should a programmer generate per day?” cannot be measured effectively. There is
    also a question about whether lines of code should be the basis of measurement
    at all. A solution to this dilemma is to create a Job Description Matrix which
    provides the specific details of each job responsibility along with the necessary
    measurement criteria for performance as depicted in Fig. [9.7](#Fig7).![../images/480347_1_En_9_Chapter/480347_1_En_9_Fig7_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_9_Chapter/480347_1_En_9_Fig7_HTML.png)

    the analyst has a number of efficiency requirements within the managing engagements
    (projects) responsibility. Efficiency here means that the analyst must perform
    the task at a certain indicated level to be considered productive at that task.
    To a degree, efficiency typically establishes the time constraints to deliver
    the task. Measurement defines the method used to determine whether the efficiency
    was met. Reports are simply the vehicle in which the analyst proves that the task
    was completed and on what basis.

    that strictly focuses on the procedural and process aspects of the individual’s
    position. It not only satisfies ISO 9000, but represents a healthier way of measuring
    individual performance in an IS environment. Most individuals should know exactly
    their performance at any time during the review period. Furthermore, the matrix
    is an easy tool to use for updating new or changed performance tasks.

    outline these guidelines for the analyst functions:'
  prefs: []

    the procedures to follow to reach an ISO 9000 level (this does not necessarily
    require that certification be accomplished.)
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ISO 9000 team should develop a budget of the milestones to be reached and
    the time commitments that are required. It is advisable that the budget be forecasted
    like a project, probably using a Gantt chart to develop the milestones and timeframes.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ISO 9000 team should then communicate their objectives to the remaining
    analysts in the organization and coordinate a review session so that the entire
    organization can understand the benefits, constraints and scope of the activity.
    It is also an opportunity to allow everyone to voice their opinions about how
    to complete the project. Therefore, the meeting should result in the final schedule
    for completing the ISO 9000 objective.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ISO 9000 team should inform the other IS groups of its objectives, although
    analysts should be careful not to provoke a political confrontation with other
    parts of the IS staff. The communication should be limited to helping other departments
    understand how these analyst quality standards will interface with the entire
    software life cycle.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The work flows for the analyst tasks must be completed in accordance with the
    schedule such that everyone can agree to the confirmation steps necessary to validate
    each task. It is important that the ISO 9000 processes allow for a percentage
    of success. This means that not every process must be successful 100% of the time,
    but rather can be acceptable within some fault tolerance level. For example, suppose
    that the analyst must have a follow-up meeting with the users within 48 h after
    a previous step has been completed. It may not be realistic to meet this goal
    every time such a meeting is necessary. After all, the analyst cannot always force
    users to attend meetings in a timely way. Therefore, the ISO 9000 step may view
    this task as successful if it occurs within the 48 h 80% of the time, that is,
    within a 20% fault tolerance.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All task steps must have verification. This will require that standard forms
    be developed to confirm completion. While we have shown samples of these forms
    earlier, the ISO 9000 team should beware of producing an unwieldy process involving
    too many forms. Many software life cycles have suffered the consequences of establishing
    too many check points. Remember, ISO 9000 is a professional’s standard and should
    cater to the needs of well-trained professionals. Therefore, the ISO 9000 team
    should review the initial confirmation forms and begin the process of combining
    them into a smaller subset. That is, the final forms should be designed to be
    as generic as possible by confirming multiple tasks. For example, form AN0010
    (Fig. [9.3](#Fig3)) represents a generic project status report that was used to
    confirm various types of information attributable to different tasks.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There should be meetings held with the analysis group that focus on the alternatives
    for automating the confirmation forms as outlined earlier in this chapter. It
    is advisable that this topic be confirmed by the group since their full cooperation
    is needed for the success of the program.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Allow time for changing the procedures and the forms. Your first effort will
    not be the final one; therefore, the ISO 9000 team must plan to meet and review
    the changes necessary to make it work. Analysts should be aware that the opportunity
    for change always exists as long as it conforms to the essential objectives of
    ISO 9000.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ISO 9000 project should be at least a one-year plan, from inception of the
    schedule to actual fulfillment of the processes. In fact, an organization must
    demonstrate ISO 9000 for at least 18 months prior to being eligible for certification.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ISO 9000 group needs to be prepared and authorized to make changes to the
    job description of the analyst. This may require the submission of requests and
    authorizations to the executive management team or the human resources department.
    It is important not to overlook this step since an inability to change the organization
    structure could hinder the success of the ISO 9000 implementation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we can see from the above steps, establishing an ISO 9000 group is a significant
    commitment. However, its benefits can include a professional organization that
    controls its own quality standards. These standards can be changed on an ongoing
    basis to ensure compliance with the business objectives and requirements of the
    enterprise. Certification, while not the focus of our discussion, is clearly another
    level to achieve. Most companies that pursue certification do so for marketing
    advantage or are required to obtain it by their customers. Implementing ISO 9000
    should not require that the entire company conform at once; in fact, it is almost
    an advantage to implement it in a phased approach, department by department. The
    potential benefits of ISO 9000 concepts may fill the void in many of the IS organizations
    which lack clearly defined quality standards.
