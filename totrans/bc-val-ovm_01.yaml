    transformed into a usable form. The modern economy is data driven because data
    is valuable to employers and business leaders—it empowers them to make decisions
    based on facts, not guesses. Marketing departments use market segmentation data
    to identify new, eager customers. Human resources professionals gather data to
    recruit the best talent and verify their qualifications. Business executives examine
    macro trends to make sure that their products and services are relevant—and rely
    on aggregations to do so. The returns and savings on data usage are unprecedented
    and worth pursuing.

    itself from the sensor by depositing collagen and scar tissue around it. So, the

    stored on a chain is real. They’re immutable. You know that this transaction was
    written on a certain day at a certain time with the blockchain alone. But you
    do not have any evidence of what the data for the transaction was intended for.
    Moreover, while you know it was signed by a private key, you do not know that
    the person who signed was in control of that private key when it was signed.

    it is really two systems. The first system is this immutable ledger, the distributed
    ledger technology (DLT). It is the ability to store information and know it hasn’t
    been altered.

    to it. This relates to wallet and private key concepts. You, the owner of the
    private key, really are the central god of all blockchain. If an owner of a private
    key never sends a transaction, the blockchain does not do anything. You need the
    infrastructure to help owners of the private key control their private key, assurance
    that whatever compliance they were supposed to follow before the transaction was
    sent was completed.

    How do you establish proof that when a transaction is constructed and when it’s
    written or when it’s signed by the private key, that that signature was only applied
    when the user intended? At the heart of our economic model is assuring those layers
    of compliance.

    outside and play, you must put on your hat and your mittens, which is a rule set
    by mom. The question is, where can I enforce that? Typically, you enforce it at
    the door on your way out. In the case of crypto, ‘at the door’ means at the signing
    of the transaction. If you put a whole transaction together in Bitcoin and then
    you push sign, you send that instruction off whether you send it to a smart contract
    or to the script on a chain. Whatever is included in that sign data is what gets
    processed.

    That trusted execution environment allows us to put a rule in place that says,
    before you use this private key, you must comply with certain rules. For example,
    you may need to type in your PIN, go outside to check with the active directory
    server in your enterprise, or follow some other rules established before the key
    is used.

    question. Prove it to me. And so how do you believe that this is the only copy
    of your private information. The data on the chain could have been written by
    anybody who had copied your private key. “Do you have a copy of your private key?”
    “Yes.” “Where do you keep it?” “In a vault.” “Is it possible someone else might
    have access to the vault?” “Yes.” “How do you know if somebody does or doesn’t?”

    contract? What happened?” You can say, “Well, these ten things happened. They
    got added together to create a certain result.” Now you can assert that the smart
    contract was processed. You have evidence. What we’re doing is generating a second

    passing through institutions and each institution applying its controls likely
    at the protocol layer, we should predetermine the controls and assure that we

    the proof of compliance, and the generation of the forensics—all the work that’s
    done in smart contracts and within trust execution—is where the transactional
    revenue occurs. You don’t pay for compliance. You’ll pay for KYC. You’ll pay for
    an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) check. You’ll pay for a geolocation validation.
    The validation of controls prior to transaction sending is very important. Those
    are not part of the protocols. Those are part of the instructions, and that is
    where business opportunities to monetize are located.

    recording a wide swath of information about each data to provide a holistic picture.
    As we can manage data more efficiently, there is no limit to the global puzzles
    that blockchain-based data solutions can address. At the same time, blockchain
    secures that data under lock and key. Thus, blockchain may be critical in building
    trust by design.

- en: Yes, it’s exciting to think of the medical advances that can be made if your
    entire genetic makeup is entered into a server, but it’s less exciting when you
    think of possible outcomes when hackers get their hands on it. Blockchain will
    make that all but impossible. And, lastly, blockchain ensures that we can put
    all our data together to work toward technological advances together, rather than
    competing against each other in our own silos. When we can come together and share
    data, the results will be far greater than the sum of what we could each accomplish
    on our own.
