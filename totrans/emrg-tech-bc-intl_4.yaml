    global commerce. The supply chain network, however, is highly centralized, with
    third parties managing virtually every step of the supply chain process. Supply

    payment, but also track goods in transport, confirm delivery status, and track
    warehousing. One of the most interesting applications of blockchain technology
    in the supply chain industry is the use of smart contracts. In the case of the
    supply chain, smart contracts can be used, for example, to trigger the delivery
    of an order once payment is recorded on the blockchain. Other ways that the blockchain
    can benefit supply chain managers and their companies include greater transparency
    and accountability between suppliers; a ledger of manifests, departure, and arrival
    times; and a reduction in human error across the board thanks to more widespread
    automation. An overview of the transformation caused by the Blockchain of Things
    can be found in [Figure 3.10](#ch3fig10).
