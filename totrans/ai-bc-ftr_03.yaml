- en: Intelligent vehicles have become a common phenomenon whereas establishing secure
    communication between those vehicles through multiple networks has become a universal
    solicitude. Vehicular communication aims to provide secure communication and reduce
    the cost of traffic congestion by processing real-time data. This proliferation
    paradigm of vehicular systems represents several options for communication such
    as message sharing and data transmission, and thus it becomes vulnerable in terms
    of security and privacy. However, artificial intelligence has encountered an undeniable
    development in every research field including healthcare, transportation management,
    academia, and genetic engineering. Consequently, blockchain technology has brought
    plausible accomplishments in those fields where maintaining security is the first
    precedence. Considering the recent establishments of both artificial intelligence
    (AI) and blockchain technology, researchers have solved vehicular network-related
    security problems using those technologies separately and combinedly as well.
    The common security concerns include Sybil attacks, Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks,
    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, malicious attacks, which cause data manipulation,
    data outflow, message delay, and traffic congestion. In this paper, we reviewed
    recent developments based on research works addressing the issues related to vehicular
    ad hoc networks and vehicular social networks. We have highlighted the proposed
    solutions relying on AI and blockchain technologies while identifying new research
    directions.

- en: Vehicular networks are considered one of the most demanding yet challenging
    classes of mobile networks that provide the vehicles with the media to communicate
    with other vehicles, infrastructures, and devices. Consequently, they play a vital
    role in maintaining a rigorous traffic system. The expansion of Internet-of-things
    (IoT) in vehicular networks leads to building [[1](#CR1)] vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),
    vehicle-to-human (V2H), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-pedestrian
    (V2P) communications, and thus summarizes vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.
    Over the last few years, intelligent transportation systems have become a significant
    yet prominent research field both in industry and academia. Within a few decades,
    Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) will become a full-fledged reality due
    to the advancements of intelligent vehicles. Rapid modifications in technology
    have brought new features amplified in both vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET)
    and Vehicular Social Networks (VSN) systems. Therefore, vehicular network systems
    have become dynamic and heterogeneous as well. Also, these modern vehicles have
    several applications embedded in their systems, most of which require intelligent
    decision-making [[2](#CR2)]. Indeed, these applications have made today’s vehicles
    more efficient and modernized. These applications can be categorized based on
    target use, transmission method, communication method, vehicle technology, delay
    tolerance mode, and radio technology. For instance, real-time navigation features
    using GPS, street surveillance features, autonomous driving features, and so on
    [[1](#CR1)]. Although VANET and VSN connections have several significances in
    vehicle communication, they are vulnerable [[3](#CR3)] in terms of security, privacy,
    and trust issues.

- en: Security is considered as one of the elementary concerns of today’s vehicular
    network systems due to their increased vulnerability and complexity. As a vehicular
    security system, both VANET and VSN should ensure that not only the transmitted
    data comes from a trusted origin but also that the transmitted data should not
    be encountered by any other sources. Also, these networks should maintain security
    and privacy at the same time, which sometimes happens to be contradictory. Accordingly,
    privacy and authentication are also considered fundamental concerns of vehicular
    networks. Privacy allows an individual to be the controller of his or her data
    sharing with others, and the creation of anonymous authentication helps to protect
    privacy in general. However, security and privacy often are compromised through
    several denial-of-service (DoS) attacks which result in inaccurate data transmission
    and data outflow. Such attacks include side-channel attack, message injection,
    spoofing, packet sniffing, bogus information transmission, in-vehicle spoofing,
    fuzzy attack, and malicious attack [[4](#CR4)]. Vehicle networks have been interconnected
    with cellular and IT mechanisms which have made them vulnerable in various conditions.
    Nevertheless, considering the vulnerabilities of vehicular networks, nowadays
    researchers have implemented various artificial intelligence and blockchain technology-based
    solutions to prevent security threats.

    for improvements in almost every sector of research, especially in transportation
    management systems for upgrading traffic systems in terms of security. AI panoramically
    has the ability to rationalize human intelligence through simulations and then
    can take the necessary actions that have the best chance to attain a particular
    goal. AI pushes such systems to get smarter and more user-friendly. Applications
    of AI can be achieved through the implementations of different Machine Learning
    (ML) based algorithms such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
    reinforcement learning. Nowadays, vehicles [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)] can also perform
    human-like or even superhuman behaviors accordingly due to the applications of
    AI techniques such as the automated vehicles of Cruise, Waymo, and Google. The
    advancements of AI for Vehicles (AIV) have enlightened the possibility of autonomous
    driving, which depended upon feature extraction of human driving behavior by mitigating
    human faults. To date, AI has been able to acknowledge [[7](#CR7)] V2X communication
    through its implementation by dint of swarm intelligence, machine learning, deep
    learning, and optimization techniques. ML as a part of AI has led several researchers
    to utilize supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning upon both VANET and
    VSN to secure privacy, proper data transmission [[8](#CR8)]. In this chapter,
    we have deliberately focused on security and data related issues of vehicular
    networks and their AI and blockchain-based solutions.

    ledger that allows storing the sources of digital assets/information [[9](#CR9)].
    In recent times, blockchain has become an uprising technology for data privacy
    due to its transparency in accessible ways to reduce fraud risk. Bitcoin, the
    implementation of blockchain, is supposedly the main reason behind the development
    of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is considered as the solution
    to those security and privacy concerns where data integrity and secured data sharing
    are the foremost concerns. Working for [[10](#CR10)] cryptocurrency and bitcoin,
    blockchain technology has made its way to secure intelligent vehicle’s privacy
    while sharing data. Blockchain-based solutions [[11](#CR11)] have ensured safety,
    data privacy, and resilience of telecommunication-based transportation systems.
    Blockchain supports programmable smart contacts and has the ability to automate
    the generation of structured events, actions, and payments as well. Blockchain
    technology comprises four major modules [[12](#CR12)]: cryptography, structure,
    census, and smart contract. The vision behind the census mechanism is to make
    suspicious entities agree on a version of a valid block so that the mechanism
    can provide verifiable data over the network. Besides, cryptographic hash functions
    help the vehicular networks to attain security, privacy, and anonymity.'

    the issues of vehicle networks such as data privacy, confidentiality, outflow,
    and delay. However, convergence and combination of both AI and blockchain [[13](#CR13)]
    have been comprehensively studied for sustainable future generations. Deploying
    both AI and blockchain technology simultaneously in an intelligent vehicle system
    raises many queries due to high resource demands and computational complexity.
    Until now, very few studies have taken place regarding this issue because of the
    feasibility questions that arise. Apart from the conditions, AI’s learning algorithms
    on a scalable blockchain technique embedded in the same architecture would portray
    a smart, secure, and efficient vehicular network system.

    and network-based attacks. Application-based attacks refer to the attacks occurring
    upon the features of vehicular systems. Application-based attacks include inaccurate
    data transmission, VANET message injection, outflow of transmitted data, secure
    message violation, message delivery delay whereas network-based attacks include
    Sybil attacks, DoS (Denial of service) attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack,
    traffic congestion, abnormal behaviors of local sub-networks, etc. These existing
    problems were resolved by the researchers using AI and Blockchain technology [[15](#CR15)–[31](#CR31)].

    For example, regression, decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k Nearest
    Neighbor (kNN), Random Forest, etc. can be applied to almost all data-related
    problems. On the other hand, for a huge dataset, different deep learning methods
    can be used as they use multiple artificial neural network layers in the structure
    and can make intelligent decisions.'

    ledge characteristics and it is reportedly created by some anonymous developers
    for secure cryptocurrency. In blockchain, different data can be stored on multiple
    systems around the world having the same blockchain network. Besides, the data
    in the blockchain network deliberately remains [[37](#CR37)] immutable, transparent,
    and irreversible. Hence, the data in the block cannot be changed due to the univocal
    connection of the cryptocurrency algorithms of the network. It has been anticipated
    [[38](#CR38)] that blockchain preferably can bring better results in VANET security,
    healthcare technology, and supply chain management system because of its being
    distributed and decentralized. Applications of blockchain technology could be
    categorized as shown in Fig. [3](#Fig3):![../images/507793_1_En_2_Chapter/507793_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/507793_1_En_2_Chapter/507793_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.png)'

- en: Although researchers are doing outstanding work on different vehicular network-related
    problems using learning-based algorithms, blockchain technology, and other well-known
    algorithms, there are still multiple open challenges that need to be overcome.
    First of all, most of the proposed methods were tested using different simulated
    environments [[20](#CR20), [25](#CR25), [28](#CR28), [29](#CR29), [31](#CR31)].
    Simulated environments let those projects work in a limited environment whereas
    real-time simulation is needed to solve actual scenarios on multi-platform technologies.
    Despite the fact that the outcomes of those studies were considerable, there are
    still some chances that the proposed methods might face some challenges in real-life
    traffic data. Secondly, the experiments were performed using a limited number
    of scenarios. Therefore, in many proposed methods, robustness and mobility are
    not settled yet. Thus, the performance of those methods lacks trust metrics due
    to connectivity and fitness. Thirdly, a unified method to block an attacker from
    the vehicular network is still an open challenge [[7](#CR7)]. Researchers have
    been able to mitigate the effects of intrusion on networks but an approach to
    both detect and block the attacker still remains a concern. Fourthly, when the
    density of the traffic increases, few algorithms lose their peak performance,
    which might cause a huge problem for those algorithms when obtaining information
    and detecting attacks [[17](#CR17)].

    VSN, defined instructions and appropriate knowledge should be interpreted for
    enhancing the accuracy of those algorithms. There can be several prospects of
    expanding intelligent systems on autonomous vehicles in terms of sensory data
    analysis, recognition of accurate navigation paths, and thus, ensuring safety-oriented
    tasks.

    a huge computational cost and storage facility in some cases, including AI and
    blockchain technologies. Therefore, additional research should be performed to
    scale down the cost.

- en: Over the last few decades, human civilization has encountered tremendous advancements
    in almost every sector of living, especially in transportation systems. From man-operated
    vehicles to intelligent vehicles, there have always been revolutionary changes
    due to technological developments in the systems. It has been projected that the
    major accomplishment of intelligent vehicles is its ability to connect with other
    networks (other vehicles, devices, infrastructures) in a fully automatic way.
    There are several scopes to improve vehicular communications in terms of computations
    cost and resource management as well. It is also supposed to assure safety measures
    and privacy of vehicular communications between the networks. But the medium of
    such communications can easily be violated and thus can cause several network
    breaches. Sybil attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and malicious network attacks
    are some of them which cause both security and privacy contraventions. In recent
    times, there are many technical solutions that have been implemented to address
    those problems. However, some issues require more detailed solution providers
    and therefore researchers are now working on AI and blockchain-based solutions
    to vehicular network issues. Lately, it has been envisioned that providing solutions
    combining both AI and blockchain technology can ensure better performance of vehicular
    communications in terms of privacy and computational cost.

- en: In this chapter, we have analyzed a total of seventeen papers that are related
    to AI and blockchain-based solutions of vehicular network security issues. Since
    we have gathered recent research works upon vehicular network’s existing solution,
    it should have a greater impact on future reference. Although most of the papers
    possessed legitimate solutions using AI and blockchain, some of them lacked in
    performance on a real-time basis. It is also noticeable that most of the fraud
    detection methods of those papers have been prototyped using learning algorithms.
    Besides, blockchain-based solutions ensured the security of VANET communication
    as the experiment of those research. To summarize, both AI and blockchain technology-based
    solutions for VANET and VSN related issues are increasing in popularity due to
    their consistency of better performance. Despite all the improvements in vehicular
    communication, there are still some issues to address in terms of stimulation
    and backgrounds. It regardless needs deeper understanding because there are a
    many more papers that we have not considered here. Also, further research is needed
    to solve such matters so that intelligent vehicular communication can be performed
    on real-time applications.
