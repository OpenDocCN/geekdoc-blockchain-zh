- en: 'This chapter analyses the blockchain implemented by Genuino in the collectibles
    industry. Since collectibles are subject to high risk of counterfeiting and fake
    replications, blockchain technology can help substantially to ensure transparency,
    originality, ownership, and data security and protection. Two methods to use blockchain
    in the industry seem to be the most widespread today: creating digital native
    collectibles on blockchain and transposing physical objects into the blockchain
    by creating digital twins. By using blockchain, new consumer clusters emerge,
    highlighting the need to modernize both the traditional economies and the current
    business models.'

- en: 'The collectibles market has experienced an important modification with the
    e-commerce revolution, which moved the collectibles trade from shops to online
    platforms such as eBay (Heitner, 2016; Seideman, 2018). However, this shift implied
    a considerable increase of fakes. Among the technologies available to mitigate
    such risks, the blockchain technology is now emerging as a possible solution to
    these business issues. Among the full set of options and features, the blockchain
    enables firms to create non-fungible tokens, which turn out to be secure and unchangeable
    and whose uniqueness, originality, and ownership are guaranteed through the blockchain
    (Tapscott and Tapscott, 2016). Research has already documented the adoption of
    blockchain to mitigate the risks of counterfeiting items (Debayouty et al., 2021),
    which makes blockchain the ideal technology to solve this issue also for collectibles.
    In particular, two methods seem to be the most widespread today, whose application
    in the collectible and memorabilia industry is definitely feasible: 1) creating
    digital native collectibles on blockchain and 2) transposing physical objects
    into the blockchain by creating digital twins.'

- en: 'The option of creating digital native collectibles on blockchain has upfront
    advantages in the collectible and memorabilia industry. In fact, the blockchain
    protects related tokens, which are impossible to destroy, counterfeit, or replicate.
    Hence, users can engage in ownership and trade them easily (Rensing, 2021). Recently,
    Dapper Labs created and sold CriptoKitties, (https://www.dapperlabs.com), which
    are fully digital and unique carton cats. Only two months after their launch in
    2018, Dapper Labs managed to generate a turnover close to $20 million (Zorloni,
    2018). Given the great success with the CriptoKitties, Dapper Labs then turned
    to sports collectibles by creating the NBA Top Shots in collaboration with the
    NBA (Browne, 2021). NBA Top Shots invented a new category of collectibles: the
    key moments of NBA games. Through this type of collectible, consumers can buy
    videos of key moments of a certain match and become exclusive owners (Guzman,
    2021). The business model linked to NBA Top Shots created a turnover of $50 million
    in the first 30 days (Guzman, 2021). After purchase, moments can be traded between
    fans. For example, a key moment in a match with LeBron James has been sold for
    $208,000 (Browne, 2021). Alternative approaches consist of digital collectible
    cards, which have the same functionalities of the physical ones. Anyways, there
    are several applications suitable for these options. Dapper Lab created tokens
    for Mixed Martial Arts MMA (Roberts, 2020), Sorare (https://sorare.com), and Fantastec
    Swap (https://www.swap-fantastec.com). Player Tokens Inc., turned to baseball
    (https://playertokens.co), while Animoca Brands (https://www.animocabrands.com)
    entered the world of Moto GP and Formula 1 (Schmidt, 2020). Finally, some companies
    embrace more sports simultaneously, such as Ex Sport (https://www.ex-sports.io).'

- en: A different, more complex approach to tokenization consists of bringing physical
    sports collectibles into the digital world through blockchain technology. The
    physical object “transposition” involves creating a digital twin in the blockchain.
    Fantastec Swap (https://www.fantastec.io/#home) uses a hybrid approach by both
    creating full digital collectibles and turning some physical objects into digital
    ones. A typical example of such applications are autographs. The Fantastec Swap’s
    partners are some top international soccer clubs such as Real Madrid, Borussia
    Dortmund, and Arsenal. These partnerships provide an example of the economic value
    of following the business model. A similar approach has been taken by Collectable.com
    (https://collectable.com), who searches for high-value sports collectables, verifies
    their authenticity, and makes sure that they are conserved in the best possible
    way. The physical collectibles are then held by Collectable.com, which creates
    a Digital Twin on the blockchain. Collectable.com customers can then purchase
    the digital twin entirely or in fractions thereof and hold them in their portfolio.
    In the Collectable.com marketplace, consumers can trade with collectables and
    create a secondary market that works similarly to the stock market.

    in the collectibles industry. Among those, Genuino has certainly taken a different
    and original approach to manage collectibles (https://genuino.world/page.html).
    The Genuino's final goal is to combat counterfeiting in the sports collectibles
    market while allowing enthusiasts to hold physical and digital objects and exchange
    freely. Genuino’s idea is to digitalize collectibles by applying t-shirt patches
    that collect information on sport events. Examples of information are the athlete’s
    name, whether he played a game, the performance, the amount of time he played,
    and its roles. The patch receives information and signals from physical oracles,
    located throughout the playing field and integrated within all sport facilities.
    The collected information is then recorded to the blockchain, becoming then trustable,
    traceable, valuable, and original. Considering the different approach adopted
    by Genuino, we will go through the full case to highlight how the blockchain is
    used, the possible advantages linked, as well as the emerging threats.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The collectibles market is a growing industry worth around $370 billion a year
    (Heitner, 2016; Ito, 2020). People buy collectibles for several motivations: pure
    passion, affirmation of a social status, social consensus, philanthropy, and speculative
    investment (Bleve et al., 2018). Collectables are often assimilated into real
    luxury goods that reflect the owners’ passion and lifestyle (Hechler-Fayd’herbe
    and Picinati di Torcello, 2020). According to a survey conducted by the Credit
    Suisse, more than 70% of customers are collectors and buy collectibles most likely
    to cultivate their passions. Furthermore, collectibles have recently gained great
    popularity as a form of investment, which can diversify one’s portfolio (Bleve
    et al., 2018; Kiesnoski, 2019). This finding is especially true for ultra-high-net-worth
    individuals, as collectibles count between 5% and 10% (with peaks of 15%) of the
    total amount invested (Hechler-Fayd''herbe and Picinati di Torcello, 2020). These
    percentages are in line with other consulting and professional advice and reports
    (Kiesnoski, 2019). Although investments on collectives are currently increasing
    in the range $250 and $5000 (Hechler-Fayd’herbe and Picinati di Torcello, 2020),
    Deloitte highlights that the attention for collectibles depends on its low correlation
    with traditional assets (Bleve et al., 2018), which is a proxy of a diversified
    portfolio.'

- en: Figure 1 (Ito, 2020) shows the most common categories of collectibles classified
    by size and concertation. The latter consists of the number of items included
    in each category and their impact on the within-category sales. The colors identify
    clusters of goods. The size of the bubbles indicates the category’s global trade
    volume. Accordingly, art, classic cars, wine, coins, stamps, and sports memorabilia
    are the most prominent collectibles. In this chapter, we focus on the sports memorabilia
    market, since it offers numerous opportunities to apply the blockchain technology
    given its size and growth (Seideman, 2018). In fact, millennials and members of
    Generation Z, who have the financial means to enjoy collections, are often willing
    to collect this type of objects (Weil, 2019). Sports memorabilia represents a
    fundamental segment of the collectibles market, involving 67 million people a
    year (Heitner, 2016) and about $10 billion globally, with approximately half from
    the United States (Seideman, 2018). Jerseys used by sports superstars can often
    be valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars (Weil, 2019). In June 2019, Babe
    Ruth’s New York Yankees jersey from 1928-1930 has been sold at auction for $5.64
    million, making it the most expensive sports memorabilia item ever sold (Weil,
    2019). The most popular items are those that belonged to the 6-time NBA champion
    and superstar Michael Jordan (Heitner, 2016), whose popularity is constantly growing
    thanks through the recent ESPN docuseries, “The Last Dance” (Red, 2020). The jersey
    wore by Jordan during the farewell match with the Chicago Bulls was auctioned
    for $173,000 (Heitner, 2016).

    within the sports memorabilia market (Red, 2020). In the past, William Mastro,
    also called “The King of Memorabilia” and owner of Mastro Auction (Crosby, 2015),
    was accused and later sentenced to 20 months in jail for defrauding his clients;
    he tampered with sports memorabilia and sold fake items for more than 7 years
    (Crosby, 2015). However, Mastro’s case is not isolated. The “Bullpen” investigation
    conducted by the FBI starting in the 1990s reveals that about 50% of sports memorabilia
    sold in the United States are counterfeit, while certain items present a counterfeit
    rate of up to 90% (The Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005). These estimates
    make the sports memorabilia market very risky and uncertain, as confirmed by the
    United States Postal Inspection Service (2019).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important threats persisting in the sports memorabilia market relate
    to the difficulty to verify an object’s originality, the peculiar skills requested
    and the high experience needed to verify the originality, and the exchange system
    regulating the objects’ transactions (Weil, 2019; Thomas, 2020; Red, 2020). To
    date, collective objects are exchanged between fans and collectors either through
    independent auctions or generalist websites such as eBay (Seideman, 2018). According
    to Pownall (2017), private sales mobilize 70% of the total value of sports memorabilia
    market, whose transactions are most likely finalized online, without any face-to-face
    meeting, through payments that are not guaranteed, and with uncertain shipment
    to the buyer's location. Therefore, the buyer is unable to verify the originality
    of a collectible object before receiving it physically. Hence, buyers have insufficient
    operational tools against possible scams, while they can look at the price as
    a proxy that signals the items’ originality. In fact, a price outside the market
    price – either above or below – could warn buyers of possible scams (Weil, 2019;
    Thomas, 2020). Alternatively, buyers can collect information about the sellers,
    verifying features like their presence in the market or their reliability in past
    transactions (Weil, 2019). Items can also be either certified and authenticated
    by professional organizations like the Professional Sports Authenticator JSA and
    Beckett or purchased from these sources (Red, 2020). However, several issues remain,
    like the cost and timing for the authentication procedure as well as the risk
    of false certificates and certifiers’ mistakes (Thomas, 2020).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Genuino is an innovative startup within the ICT sector, funded in the USA in
    2018 and established in Italy on February 1, 2019\. Genuino is a decentralized
    protocol to certify, authenticate, and trade digital collectibles backed by certified
    physical assets, which integrates blockchain, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence
    technologies into a proprietary web app and mobile app (Genuino, 2020). By combining
    all of these technologies, Genuino connects both the digital and physical worlds.
    The company’s motto is: “Collect Digital. Own Physical”. The idea for this application
    comes from the awareness that we live in an era of post truth, in which it is
    difficult to blindly trust regarding product genuineness based only on the sellers’
    communication and advertising. Genuino knows that the new primary consumers’ needs
    are to verify a product first hand and to gain understanding and gather evidence
    on a product. Companies should adapt to this need and inspire the trust of consumers,
    creating transparency relative to a product and along the whole supply chain.
    The certification protocol that Genuino has created meets these needs; the system
    collects data within the production processes while minimizing the risk of manipulation
    and increasing the product’s authenticity. Genuino''s mission is to enhance quality
    and guarantee the traceability, sustainability, and anti-counterfeiting of the
    product, thereby safeguarding the final consumer, the product manufacturer, and
    all stakeholders. Although Genuino knows the potential of its blockchain approach,
    today, it tests and applies its solution to the food sector by exploiting a partnership
    with Daruma sushi, as well as in the sports collectibles thanks to the partnership
    with ACF Fiorentina. The latter represents the main sector of Genuino''s business
    today and in the near future. Genuino seeks to create a solution against counterfeiting
    and to empower brands. These dual targets will allow them to tell their stories
    and engage their fans through NFTs connected to physical certified assets. To
    this end, Genuino''s solution must achieve three primary objectives: guarantee
    the authenticity of a jersey and distinguish between “Match Worn” or “Match Prepared”,
    trace the constituent elements of the shirt, and trace the creation and transfer
    of ownership events.'

    Eleonora Mulas, two Italians abroad with the desire to bring a little Italianism
    out of their country of origin. To do this, they first turned their attention
    to the food sector, for which Italy is recognized all over the world, trying to
    certify the quality of products with the blockchain. However, they quickly realized
    that this was probably not the best sector, especially because of the scale-up
    issues linked to the blockchain technology (De Giovanni, 2020). In contrast, people
    within the sports sector are much more willing to adopt new technologies, and
    that has allowed for greater and faster mass adoption. In February 2019, Genuino
    was founded as a company in Italy and, after acquiring further skills and capital,
    Genuino developed the first prototype of blockchain technology with ACF Fiorentina.
    The prototype has been tested in the last two rounds of the Serie A 2019/2020
    championship: Fiorentina-Roma and Fiorentina-Inter. Meanwhile, Genuino was selected
    to participate in the CES in Las Vegas, one of the largest events in this sector
    in the world. The project with ACF Fiorentina soon evolved and moved from just
    the certification of the jerseys to the creation of a marketplace with a series
    of digital collectibles to engage with their fans. The product will be launched
    in July 2021 for the start of the new sporting season and will include both physical
    and digital collectibles.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Through the certification process, Genuino seeks to guarantee the authenticity
    of jerseys worn by players during official matches. In fact, especially when objects
    have high economic value, a high counterfeiting rate exists (De Giovanni, 2019).
    This is a demanding challenge, since the protocol developed must guarantee the
    certification of the object on the blockchain with the use of all required technologies
    and without interfering with the usual activities of staff and athletes before,
    during, and after the match. Although Genuino’s prototype has been created for
    football games, it can be easily applied to other sports. Each football jersey
    is created from a virgin anonymous jersey plus a set of patches that can be applied
    via a thermal press. The jerseys prepared for an event become two types: match
    worn or match prepared. Match-worn jerseys are the jerseys worn and that actually
    entered the field during the game phase. Two shirts enter the field (one during
    the first half and one for the second half). One is left to the football team
    for sale, and the other remains available to the player who wore it. Match-prepared
    jerseys are prepared and/or worn jerseys that have not actively participated in
    the match. Match-prepared jerseys can be used at a later event if they have not
    been stressed. For each match played, the following are prepared: two shirts for
    each player, two shirts per goalkeeper in three possible colors, and about ten
    neutral jerseys to customize during the moment in case of need.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To ensure the achievement of the certification objectives, each jersey must
    be uniquely identified both in the physical and digital settings. For this reason,
    a smart patch containing identification passive tags are added to each shirt.
    A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) will also be created on the blockchain for each jersey.
    The smart patch is the connection between the physical object to the digital one.
    A gate records the passage of the jersey once the player enters and exits from
    the pitch. All recorded data is directly registered on the blockchain without
    third-party intermediation. Once this background process has been completed, it
    will be possible to sell the shirts and tokens that represent them digitally.
    The jerseys can be purchased and exchanged through the Genuino Marketplace.

    of the jersey can be performed using the Genuino app, upon framing the patch.
    The transfer of jersey ownership takes place in two steps, a physical transfer
    and a digital one. Once the buyer has transferred the agreed-upon fee, the seller
    transfers the jersey as a physical object and the digital NFT token representing
    the certificate of shirt ownership to the buyer. The NFT token transfer takes
    place like a normal wallet transaction as the NFT token is transferred from one
    wallet to another, once the jersey authenticity is validated by the buyers through
    the Genuino app.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within the certification protocol described above, blockchain and non-blockchain
    technologies are applied. Given the positioning of Genuino’s “Collect Physical.
    Own Digital” mission, blockchain technology alone is not enough to guarantee an
    object’s originality. Other technologies are needed to connect the physical object
    with the virtual token created on the blockchain (De Giovanni, 2021). In fact,
    the transition from physical to virtual is one of the most delicate phases in
    the certification process on the blockchain, since it is the easiest step to counterfeit.
    In this section, we will determine the fundamental technologies used by Genuino
    in this phase. In particular, we will see how the blockchain, NFTs, and patches
    work altogether.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the fundamental choices that Genuino made was the selection of the blockchain
    to use when registering the NFTs linked to the physical object and based on which
    the transactions take place. Initially, Genuino's choice was Ethereum, which is
    particularly effective and suitable for operations of this type. Ethereum is one
    of the most important public blockchains and guarantees the solidity and reliability
    of the recorded information. Furthermore, Ethereum creates NFTs called ERC 721,
    which lend themselves to this type of use. However, due to the increase in the
    cost of gas, Genuino had to revise its choice. Gas refers to the amount of money
    required by miners to perform operations such as transactions and smart contracts
    on Ethereum (Kay, 2021). The amount of gas required is not the same for each operation
    but depends on the speed with which you want the operation to be completed, the
    complexity of the operation, and the number of pending transactions in the network
    (Kay, 2021). With the outbreak of Decentralized Finance in the summer of 2020,
    the number of complex transactions in Ethereum increased considerably, leading
    to network congestion (Haig, 2021). This has resulted in average transaction fees
    exceeding $20 per transaction (Foxley, 2021). In a traceability protocol like
    that of Genuino, in which it is important to write every relevant event on the
    blockchain, the cost to write the information on the blockchain would have been
    prohibitive. So, Genuino had to review the choice and rely on L2 EVM. The two
    main advantages of using L2 for the application of Genuino are that it allows
    one to perform transactions with a very low commission in gas (e.g., up to 500
    transactions can be made for few cent of a dollar), and it allows one to create
    a block and, therefore, to record the information very quickly. Furthermore, as
    an Ethereum side chain, it “bridges” with Ethereum and accommodates any request
    to transfer the tokens to Ethereum.

- en: NFTs are created on the L2 blockchain. “Non-fungible tokens are unique, digital
    items with blockchain-managed ownership” (Finzer, 2020). Non-fungible goods are
    all objects that are not interchangeable, in contrast to fungible goods, such
    as money, which are perfectly interchangeable. It makes no difference whether
    a person has one 10€ banknote or another, because the banknotes have exactly the
    same value. Thanks to the blockchain, it is possible to assign the ownership of
    these objects to subjects who can hold them in their wallets and manage them as
    they like. NFTs can move across different ecosystems and across different Blockchains
    (Finzer, 2020). Another interesting feature of NFTs is that they can be traded
    and sold, and the high speed with which this can take place gives them high liquidity
    (Wintermeyer, 2021). Examples of NFTs include collectibles, game items, digital
    art, event tickets, domain names, and even ownership records for physical assets
    (Finzer, 2020).

- en: 'NFTs are tools used by Genuino to represent physical shirts in the virtual
    world, functioning as real certificates of ownership of the jersey. The connection
    between the physical shirt and the digital NFT takes place through a smart patch
    applied to the shirts and the stadium gate. Patches are applied to the game jerseys.
    Using the patches, the virgin jersey can be customized with the sponsors, the
    players’ names, and information about the competition during which the jersey
    was used. In the world of football, the patches applied to the jerseys are produced
    by a single supplier and made of different materials. There are two main patch
    packages: front patches, which represent sponsors and other ancillary info, and
    back patches, which indicate the player’s name and jersey number. To recognize
    the t-shirts on the Genuino’s blockchain, an additional small patch is applied
    to each t-shirt (Figure 2) without disturbing the operations or the activities
    linked to the game preparation, including the game jerseys. The patches are applied
    once to the blank jerseys, and their preparation process varies only marginally,
    considering the different types of patches. This new smart patch was developed
    by Genuino in partnership with DekoGrapics, one of the world leaders in the sector.
    The challenges that characterized the research and development phase were mainly
    due to the sensor durability embedded in the patch. In fact, the sensors are subjected
    to stresses when applied to the t-shirt as well as during the washing phase.'

    On the one hand, firms mitigate the counterfeiting issues by attaching a digital
    ownership certificate to their physical objects. This allows them to improve the
    brand value by protecting imitations and increasing transparency. On the other
    hand, consumers can quickly and effectively verify and validate the product by
    having proof of originality and ownership in just a few seconds. Using Genuino,
    consumers can see the jersey’s chain of ownership by tracing the object life and
    the full batch of information connected to it. Furthermore, consumers can access
    an efficient and secure platform to sell and exchange the jersey in future transactions.
    In this sense, it is worth mentioning that Genuino opens the sports collectibles
    market to three types of people: collectors, fans, and crypto enthusiasts. The
    first category includes the classic collectors of collectibles and memorabilia.
    These people collect objects independent of the blockchain; however, they can
    easily and safely exchange objects through Genuino. Furthermore, the fans and
    supporters teams are generally discouraged from purchasing sports collectibles
    due to their low purchasing skills. Genuino supports them by simplifying the purchasing
    process and involving them in the new market platform.'

    NFTs value increased exponentially in a few months. Therefore, they can invest

- en: The Genuino solution raises some concerns when connecting physical and digital
    worlds and the related processes, which can take place both on and off the chain.
    Although the data is recorded on the blockchain, thus making it unchangeable and
    guaranteed, the insertion phase offers opportunities for falsification. Therefore,
    the data entry process is the weakest and most complex task in most applications.
    Genuino has invested massively to limit these issues, especially when the process
    takes place off chain or outside the blockchain. Genuino’s motto is “Collect Digital.
    Own Physical.” Therefore, unlike the full digital collectibles, it is impossible
    to manage all tasks on chain. Off-chain steps are required for physical objects,
    specifically jerseys. To ensure their correct identification and prevent illegal
    actions like the use of stolen tags or cloning of serial numbers, the NFT token
    is generated when the owner establishes the association between the patch and
    the product. From this point, the falsification opportunities are extremely limited,
    since all data is recorded by the sensors (physical oracles) and without any human
    intervention. When the jersey worn by the player enters or leaves the field, the
    sensors capture this information and record it on the blockchain. Overall, Genuino
    achieves the target of limiting falsifications during the phases of data collection
    and record on the blockchain using IoT sensors.

    blockchain, this solution is highly challenging. Among the challenges faced, we
    previously mentioned the development of identification tags to be embedded into
    the jersey, subject to many stresses like pressure, temperature, and body fluids.
    In addition to this issue, we identified three further challenges: the patch sensors
    can be either damaged or broken, legal issues can arise, and the possible pricing
    bubble linked to NFTs (Table 1). The smart patch and its sensors are the link
    between the virtual NFT and the jersey. The sensors associate a jersey with the
    NFT on the blockchain. There is a rare possibility that the sensors are broken.
    In fact, collectors are used to conserve and prevent match-worn jerseys from being
    worn or washed and, therefore, preserve the whole market value. To avoid this
    risk, Genuino carried out various stress tests on the patches to ensure their
    resistance through the use of several machine washes. The patches have shown good
    resistance in combinations of various situation. However, for any poorly performing
    patch, Genuino has developed a procedure for a prompt replacement that involves
    checking the actual sensor breakage from the back end. The damaged jersey is then
    sent to Genuino, the damaged patch is replaced, and a new NFT is created and associated
    with the new patch. To preserve all of the information recorded in the NFT connected
    to the broken patch, Genuino transfers the entire batch of information to the
    new NFT, preserving the whole history of the shirt, and ensuring total transparency
    to the customer. Another challenge that Genuino faces concerns the legal aspects
    linked to anti money laundering (AML) with the related issue of Knowing Your Customer
    (KYC) as well as the privacy issues. The KYC falls under the AML legislation,
    including the KYC law that provides obligations for the charged parties. Usually,
    the subjects charged are qualified subjects such as lawyers, notaries, accountants,
    banks, and financial institutions. These institutes are used to identify (either
    manually or automatically) the clients who contact them for any service by crossing
    data linked to difference sources. While this legislation only applied to the
    charged parties till the cryptocurrencies have been introduced in the business
    world to manage transactions and mimic the behavior of traditional currencies.
    Tokens linked to blockchain (such as NFTs) can be added to cryptocurrencies, considering
    that the NFT is not a currency in itself. However, it can be linked to a shirt,
    a painting, a video, etc. Selling the NFT does not signify selling a currency;
    instead, it implies selling an object, thus signaling that the NFT has value and
    is very often used in a speculative way similar to cryptocurrencies.'

    who consider all crypto-assets as a sector with high potential risk of money laundering.
    Therefore, they have created a new category of subjects charged with carrying
    out crypto activities. The Italian legislative Decree 231/2007 and the fifth European
    AML directive of 2019 identify new subjects charged. Legislative Decree 231/2007,
    Article 1 letter FF identifies the following as charged subjects: “Service providers
    relating to the use of virtual currency: any natural or legal person who provides
    third parties, on a professional basis, even online, with functional services
    use, exchange, storage of virtual currency and their conversion […] as well as
    issuing, offering, transfer and clearing services and any other service functional
    to the acquisition, negotiation or intermediation in the exchange of the same
    currencies; ff-bis) digital wallet service providers [...]. “ Genuino falls into
    these categories, both for receiving and guarding digital currency and converting
    them into further digital value representations such as Genuino''s NFTs. Therefore,
    Genuino must perform these tasks to avoid legal problems.'

    first name, surname, date of birth, identity card, and photo. Then, it must keep
    this data secure and report to the authorities any suspicious transactions that
    exceed certain amounts and/or that can be considered anomalous by law. Much software
    has been developed that pursues these targets along with data collection and reporting.
    Genuino acquires the data and fulfills these obligations only for customers who
    purchase NFTs and carry out transactions to prevent the money loundering.

    compromise of privacy. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    679/2016 became fully applicable in all European countries in 2018\. Since 2018,
    all European countries are obliged to comply with the GDPR regulation, which also
    applies to companies with registered offices outside the European Union any time
    European Union citizens are involved. When Genuino acquires users' personal data,
    it must comply with this regulation. Genuino possesses sensitive data related
    to consumers, knows how many NFTs a person has, and knows that each person could
    have an NFT worth millions of euros. Therefore, Genuino could have information
    impacting individuals’ freedom and rights. Genuino pays particular attention to
    privacy, not only surrounding the possible legal burdens, but also because it
    will play a key competitive role in the future. In fact, customers are increasingly
    careful of how their data is processed by firms, especially in the crypto world.

- en: The last weakness of Genuino's solution lies in the possible bubble of NFTs.
    Indeed, while NFTs supporters believe that NFTs are the future of collectibles
    and the digital economy, a growing number of people believe that NFTs could create
    a bubble that eventually will burst (Wintermeyer, 2021). NFTs linked to collectibles
    or arts experience a constant increasing value and are traded at important speculative
    prices. One example is the NFT of a digital art by Beeple, one of the greatest
    digital artists, sold in March 2021 for nearly $70 million (Reyburn, 2021). As
    a result, the vast majority of buyers buy NFTs to speculate on and earn from a
    future sale (Turley, 2021). It is extremely difficult to assess the evolution
    of the NFT market, since there are countless factors that influence it, such as
    the interest of speculative investors, gas prices (in particular on Ethereum),
    and the possible emergence of dedicated blockchains focused on NFT (Wintermeyer,
    2021). Therefore, Genuino must operate within this changing and highly unstable
    context. The main risk for Genuino’s users could be the drastic reduction in their
    value when increasing the NFTs available. Then, no one would buy NTFs, which will
    become illiquid. For this reason, Genuino is now working on a solution based on
    decentralized finance systems to ensure that its NFTs maintain a certain liquidity
    in any situation.

    and business strategy. It will launch its product on the market in July 2021 with
    the kickoff of the Serie A 2021/2022 season in partnership with some Serie A teams
    including ACF Fiorentina. Genuino is also working on further developments of its
    product in addition to the certification process. The most important of those
    is the marketplace for the exchange of NFT tokens and physical t-shirts and for
    the sale of full digital collectibles. Consistent with Genuino's motto of “Collect
    Digital, Own Physical”, the marketplace includes three main phases with the aim
    of tradability and fan engagement. The first phase is called “Collect Digital”.
    In this phase, it is possible to collect digital objects that consumers can obtain
    by participating in drops or by purchasing virtual packages of collectibles. The
    second phase is called “Own Physical”. In this phase, collectors must complete
    challenges and missions when collecting digital NFTs. Upon completion of these
    missions, they will receive the physical object as a reward. These first two phases
    are aimed primarily at collectors and fans, while the third phase is aimed at
    all three categories of Genuino customers. The third stage is called “Unleash
    Defi”. This phase, combining the Genuino token with a decentralized finance system,
    allows the creation of value through farming and staking. Moreover, these dynamics
    ensure the NFT liquidity in case no one wants to buy the item.

- en: This chapter analyzed the case of Genuino, which applied the blockchain technology
    to the sport collectibles to extract the value behind the industry objects and
    connect these physical objects with a digital platform through the blockchain.
    The presence of blockchain in the Genuino’s business activates three consumers’
    categories, specifically collectors, fans, and crypto enthusiasts. Each has different
    motivations for accessing the blockchain solution, which is fully managed through
    NFTs linked to physical objects.

- en: The blockchain uses physical oracles, most likely IoT linked to patches to collect
    information during sports events and to register everything in the blockchain
    to increase the collectibles’ values. This method of recording information offers
    advantages in terms of mitigating counterfeiting issues; providing proof of the
    collectibles’ originality; provide incorruptible details regarding the event,
    the player, and the collectibles; and ensure that the items registered on the
    blockchain platform can be exchanged within the Genuino’s platform in a secure
    and authorized environment.

    to face. From the operational side, the patches’ conformance and durability can
    create some issues throughout the entire process. Since several types of agreements
    exist in traditional partnerships (Preeker and De Giovanni, 2018), Genuino could
    bring the partnership with DekoGrapics to a higher level, integrating the contractual
    agreements within the blockchain as well. Furthermore, legal issues must still
    be understood and governed. Being a completely new business model and a different
    environment, the exchanges and the rules being part of the entire set of transactions
    must be rethought and reengineered dynamically. In this sense, Genuino must still
    solve the issue of money laundering, since the NFTs are not cryptocurrencies to
    be exchanged in the stock market, but they carry out economic value as they were
    cryptocurrencies. This kind of situation can create resistances from consumers
    who are not familiar with such types of applications as well as from regulators
    and legislation that need integration in comparison to traditional transactions.
    Finally, Genuino needs to set a plan of investments and strategic actions to guarantee
    the stakeholder’s privacy at large. In fact, stakeholders should provide and exchange
    confidential information, which can be subject to cyber warfare and cyber espionage
    over time. The challenge is to guarantee confidentiality through ad hoc and updated
    protection systems.

    First, the existence of new consumer clusters inspires research on strategic consumers
    who adjust their purchasing behavior according to the market conditions and opportunities.
    Within the Genuino framework, the NFT value and market perception can modify the
    purchasing attitudes of collectors, fans, and crypto enthusiasts. Second, future
    research should analyze how the formation of the collectibles’ price changes according
    to the teams’ performance and, consequently, the convenience of adopting blockchain
    technologies. Third, Genuino can evaluate the possibility to acquire knowledge
    regarding making the patches, with the objective of mitigating any operational
    issues emerging from suppliers. Finally, the current blockchain technology created
    by Genuino links most likely to physical oracles located all over the playing
    field. Additional oracles as well as other digital technologies can be generally
    adopted to increase the object originality and value (De Giovanni and Cariola,
    2020). For example, human oracles could be linked to the fans’ tickets. Important
    moments in a match are then collected by the IoT system, and the information is
    exchanged with the human oracles. The fans receive tokens for any verified information,
    which is then transferred and recorded to the blockchain when the human oracle
    consensus is reached. Other types of oracles to be adopted are software oracles
    as well as inbound and outbound oracles.
