    of explaining how technological revolutions unfold, there may be no escaping the
    fact a crash will happen somewhere between the blockchain’s installation phase
    (2015–2018), and its resulting deployment phase (2018 and beyond). Carlota Perez
    is a known scholar who researched the concept of techno-economic paradigm shifts
    and the theory of great surges. This means that, if Carlota Perez is right, we
    will likely overshoot with exuberance into the installation phase, before smooth
    sailing into a prosperous deployment phase.
