    buy and obtain insurance coverage, and it’s coming faster than you might think!

    insurance or a traditional insurance company that adopts the technology. Either
    way, both are created in a decentralized cryptocurrency ledger with the use of
    smart contracts/Chaincode, which guarantee the payment from the customer to the
    investor and vice versa if an incident occurs. Blockchain is key here, because

    coverage.

    a certificate. For people, that certificate would be a document such as a birth

    security has gone into their creation, but this increases the cost. Blockchains
    allow for the recording of these traditional certificates in an unalterable history
    that anyone can look up and reference. An added feature is the ability to update
    those records as new events occur.

    much anything, from exchange of physical goods (that have digital signatures)
