- en: Blockchain technology is a decentralized technology for storing immutable records
    of transactions grouped into blocks, which are secured by cryptography. Blockchain
    technology will be revolutionizing the way we interact and exchange information.
    It offers data security and integrity and eliminates the role of trusted third-party
    valuators.

    chain management, banking, to list a few examples. As forecasted by BR SofTech
    ([https://www.brsoftech.com/](https://www.brsoftech.com/)), the market of blockchain
    technology in healthcare will be worth $829 million by 2023\. Blockchain has also
    permeated into the increasingly popular Internet of Things technology. According
    to “Bain & Company” estimates, the B2B IoT market will surpass $300 billion by
    2020\. This edited book with 10 chapters will deliberate upon the various aspects
    of blockchain technology and its prospects.

    and IoT, including various applications and challenges of IoT-based systems. IoT
    and blockchain are two emerging technologies that are expected to have an immense
    impact in the society around the world. [Chapter 2](S0065245819300014.xhtml) discusses
    integrated platforms for blockchain enablement. [Chapter 3](S0065245818300688_split_000.xhtml)
    provides a discussion of the intersection between IoT and distributed ledger technology
    (DLT), which is a family of different types of blockchain-like systems. It first
    provides an overview of the DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits,
    and challenges and then summarizes centralized IoT systems and their limitations.
    The integration of blockchain with IoT and integration benefits is presented along
    with potential application and challenges of the integration. [Chapter 4](S0065245819300257.xhtml)
    explores the potential of blockchain technology for decentralizing the autonomous
    organizations. [Chapter 5](S006524581830069X.xhtml) examines how blockchain technology
    will revolutionize the healthcare system. [Chapter 6](S0065245819300348.xhtml)
    describes the design and testing methodologies and tools to test IoT and blockchain
    applications. [Chapter 7](S0065245819300245.xhtml) surveys commonly used consensus
    mechanisms and information security technologies used in DLT (distributed ledger
    technology). [Chapter 8](S0065245818300676.xhtml) presents strategies to address
    privacy and security issues in IoT. [Chapter 9](S0065245819300336.xhtml) deliberates
    upon prospects of blockchain technology in cost savings in supply chain management
    system. [Chapter 10](S0065245819300269.xhtml) highlights the research challenges
    and future research directions in the integrated blockchain-based IoT with homomorphic
    encryption.'
