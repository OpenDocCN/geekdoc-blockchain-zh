- en: A blockchain can be thought of as the shared distributed ledger type of technology
    that stores the information of every transaction in its network. The blockchain
    has emerged with vast diversity of applications in the economical and non-economical
    areas. Blockchain technology has the potential to provide a robust span of solutions
    to the issues faced in the implementation of smart cities. As such, it displays
    the potential to create smart types of contracts more securely, by eliminating
    the need for centralized authority. A blockchain can be envisioned as a secure
    decentralized database that stores information utilizing a peer-to-peer type of
    network. The blockchain can be seen as a type of special stack, where blocks could
    be placed or stacked on top of each other. Subsequent blocks composing the blockchain
    have to be linked to each other by cryptographic type of hash. In contemporary
    times an increasing interest in the concept of blockchain technology has been
    observed. This secondary research utilizes detailed literature review of multifaceted
    sources of information, such as peer-reviewed and quality academic journal articles
    from renowned databases. With the introduction of blockchain, numerous fields
    like banking, finance, healthcare, and supply chain shall experience positive
    effects. The sustainability of smart cities can be further enhanced and ensured
    with the application of blockchain technology. One major aspect wherein blockchain
    can play an essential role is real estate and smart cities. Blockchain and Smart
    Cities concepts are fated to influence the future of our planet in numerous ways.
    Incorporating blockchain into the expansion of Smart Cities will make it possible
    to have a cross-cutting platform that connects the cities’ different services,
    adding greater transparency and security to all services and processes.

- en: A blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger, represents a write-only data
    platform sustained through a large number of nodes that do not entirely divulge
    in one another. Numerous research studies bring together blockchain, image, and
    video processing algorithms. Some of these applications may entail actions against
    false videos, processing of medical images, encryption of images, followed by
    the management of the digital content rights. The outlined approaches enable making
    sure that video has not been tampered with in connection to time stamping, making
    it possible to be listed as proof in the court of law. Blockchain innovation’s
    core segment is being entailed in an innovative set of procedures that enables
    information to be exchanged between different elements within a system. In that
    way, there are no intermediaries because members belonging to the system can be
    connected via identities, which are encrypted and with each other using distributed
    communication. Transactions are subsequently attached to a particular type of
    changeless ledger chain and distributed to each single node. With the increased
    incidences of information breaches, fraud, and extortion, numerous types of projects
    are utilizing blockchain innovation technologies in processing identity and document
    approvals. Validation by the means of blockchain is being enabled via timestamping,
    checking for legitimacy, and end-to-end encryption [[9](#CR9)].

- en: The blockchain can be conceptualized as a heap, in which the individual blocks
    are being stacked on top of the other. In this sequence, each subsequent block
    in blockchain is connected to each other by the special type of hash, called,
    cryptographic hash. The generated first block in blockchain is called the genesis
    block. These blocks are stored in the memory of the computers and run as a distinctive
    type of computer process. Knowing that each block is being constructed on top
    of the previous block, desired immutability is attained. The immutability implies
    inherent difficulty to fake/change a block and easiness to detect the tampering.
    Additional analogies for blockchain system can be visualized as the ledger book,
    whereby each block represents a separate page in the ledger, and each transaction
    represents an individual asset transfer on a ledger page. Each member in Blockchain
    includes nearly the same copy of the blockchain ledger. A blockchain transaction
    entails a transaction record in blockchain, similarly to a record warehoused in
    MySQL database. The blockchain network can either be in a government/public or
    private setting. In government run/public type blockchain, everyone is enabled
    to read or write transaction data with no need for various types of authorizations.
    In the private type of blockchain, no more than authorized nodes are enabled to
    read or write the transactional type of data inside the blockchain [[4](#CR4),
    [6](#CR6)].

    protocol, operated via nodes connected by the means of the Internet. In technical
    sense, the blockchain is supplanting the present integrated ledger structures
    with the decentralized types. A blockchain utilizes encoding systems, and it does
    not carry out the participation of a third part, thus making it stable and dependable.
    A blockchain is comprised of a distinct data blockchain. In this sense it is important
    to envision that building blocks can be constructed and scanned by particular
    participants. Its submissions are unchanging, clear, plain, and easy to use. Operations
    are documented sequentially in a constantly evolving databank. Computer structure
    is connected via the world wide web, whereby customers at every computer can obtain
    or disseminate information to different computers. In conclusion, the info is
    then being replicated and set aside via the structure by the means of a shared
    system. As such, it promotes mutual trade of substantial value devoid of a vital
    liaison [[6](#CR6), [7](#CR7), [9](#CR9), [14](#CR14)].

    mechanism against DDoS and rogue device assaults. Kim et al. introduced an idea
    of utilizing blockchain technology to address and resolve the security problems
    of a sensor-based platform. IoT gadgets represent the main components of smart
    homes, smart factories, and intelligent appliances. A blockchain-sourced authentication
    protocol was offered to focus on security problems. By utilizing that protocol,
    the IoT environment can become efficient and stable. They utilized this feature
    of blockchains in the IoT environment to safeguard the verification at runtime
    of sensors and actuators. The utilization of smart contracts makes it easy to
    automate the business logic and assists in saving time with the guarantee of zero
    error security. Significant volume of work has been performed in the area of video
    forensics. This improvement allows the video proof to be utilized in court cases.
    Recent techniques utilized for video falsification uncovering are primarily based
    on an autoencoder with periodic convolutional neural networks, augmented by an
    autoencoder with a go turn algorithm, watermarking techniques, and digital signatures.
    It was further proposed to include autoencoders and intermittent neural networks-based
    architecture to discover the video falsification. They produced a unique content-based
    signature to detect inter and intraframe falsified videos. In extension, irrespective
    of whether an image examination innovation is produced, there is a multitude of
    cases of breakdown due to the sensor-based restriction. This may similarly occur
    when restricting images for injurious aims. The Privacy Act takes into consideration
    the creation of CCTVs for public places, which requires reaching out to the owners
    of CCTVs to acquire video information. However, this represents a rather lengthy
    procedure. Irrespective of whether a video is acquired, it is difficult to utilize
    in open organizations due to the fact that video is not safeguarded to be an original
    video that has not been manipulated. Panwar et al. proposed an arrangement to
    provide sensor information confirmation through cryptographic algorithms implementing
    a log sealing system and creating permanent portions of evidence used for log
    verification. The structure ensures that sensor information and log-fixed data
    could be put away in untrusted storage with the proposed verification system ensuring
    its integrity. However, this structure depends on the dependability of the instrument;
    for example, Intel SGX store up the fixed data in an incorporated way. False news
    became a worldwide issue that raises extreme difficulties for human culture and
    the majority rules system [[9](#CR9)].

    institutions. It does so while enabling the communication of sensitive data without
    compromising security and confidentiality. In this sense, blockchain may be utilized
    in the advancement of smart cities. This can be achieved by utilizing an interoperable
    platform enabling the citizens to proactively participate in the decision-making
    processes. These processes affect the communities they belong to. They may also
    operate as a tool for managing the reputation of companies in relation to the
    activity related to the environment. The administration of a smart city via its
    systems generates a considerable volume of sensitive data that requires an oversized
    storage environment. According to latest data, cyber-attacks still pose a real
    security concern in realm of the online transactions. To mitigate the effects
    of these phenomena, blockchain technology utilizes a distributed model that increases
    the degree of entropy. This is being achieved by implicitly reducing the vulnerability
    of the systems it supports. The technology-based cryptography architecture makes
    it unlikely that transactions will be reversed or altered. Whenever a new transaction
    is broadcast on the network, the nodes have the obligation to validate and include
    it in the copy of the distributed ledger. In an invalidation scenario, it must
    simply ignore it. The consensus is reached when most of the participants composing
    the network decide on a single state. Furthermore, all participants in the system
    possess a personal key or signature utilized during creation of a transaction.
    This key allows the association between the user who created a particular transaction
    and the recipient of that transaction. At the same time, since the ledger is distributed
    and validated by the entire network, a transaction is associated with a single
    user and cannot be registered multiple times on the blockchain [[15](#CR15)].

    them to those in need of validation. Therefore, through an application, on mobile
    phone or computer, the user manages the elements that make up the identity. This
    application also controls access to this set of information. Identity related
    information may include birth dates, citizenship, university diplomas, or licenses.
    As part of the application, the user is initially assigned a self-generated identification
    number derived from the public key and a corresponding private key. This key pair
    is different from the combination of username and password. After its creation
    by the user, automatic mathematical calculations must be performed making decryption
    almost impossible This kind of identity may be implemented to identify the citizens
    of a smart city using blockchain technology. All of this ensures storage, secure
    timestamping, and decentralized hosting. This model removes the need for passwords
    and guarantees authentication with a high degree of security. An example of successful
    implementation is the Estonian e-Residency program allowing clients outside the

    are being stacked on top of the other. In this sequence, each subsequent block
    in blockchain is connected to each other by the special type of hash, called,
    cryptographic hash. The generated first block in blockchain is called the genesis
    block. These blocks are stored in the memory of the computers and run as a distinctive
    type of computer process. Knowing that each block is being constructed on top
    of the previous block, desired immutability is attained. The immutability implies
    inherent difficulty to fake/change a block and easiness to detect the tampering.
    Additional analogies for blockchain system can be visualized as the ledger book,
    whereby each block represents a separate page in the ledger, and each transaction
    represents an individual asset transfer on a ledger page. Each member in Blockchain
    includes nearly the same copy of the blockchain ledger. A blockchain transaction
    entails a transaction record in blockchain, similarly to a record warehoused in
    MySQL database. The blockchain network can either be in a government/public or
    private setting. In government run/public type blockchain, everyone is enabled
    to read or write transaction data with no need for various types of authorizations.

    over traditional centralized database systems. The first and most important advantage
    is the security against forgery. Since the blockchain depends on endorsement of
    transactions performed by verification of identity of all the parties in the network,
    false transactions cannot be verified without the authorization of all nodes in
    the network. This feature shall instantly resolve variety of the malicious issues
    faced stemming from identity stealing and fake payment plans. Transparency poses
    an additional significant advantage of the blockchain in contrast to traditional
    centralized databases. Since the blockchain is a decentralized shared database
    that is managed and coordinated across a network of devices (nodes), the data
    of every transaction remain constant among all the nodes. Therefore, numerous
    parties may utilize the exact same copy of data simultaneously. This is in contrast
    to centralized system where multiple nodes rely on siloed databases. This signifies
    improving the scope of transparency in the decentralized system. Another significant
    advantage of taking into consideration the blockchain as a solution for smart
    property systems is the efficiency. In theory, managing multiple copies of transactions
    in decentralized shared database in the blockchain could be considered inefficient
    in comparison to the siloed centralized database. In the real world, the organizations
    retain the copy of database including similar transaction data in situations such
    as data inconsistency, demanding expensive and time-consuming data resolutions.
    Consequently, utilizing a decentralized shared database solution such as blockchain
    may reduce the requisites for manual data resolution. As a consequence, a smart
    city cannot operate successfully if there is a lack of trust between organizations
    and gadgets comprising the network. Trust is the quintessence of combining all
    the components of a smart city together. The blockchain has proven itself to be
    a more efficient technology, as it offers framework for consensus in a decentralized
    ecosystem and provides complete transparency and immutability of information,
    thereby creating the blockchain as an essential layer of trust in the smart city.
    Many smart cities' exhaustive blockchain-centered decentralized solutions are
    being developed. As these platforms are expected to develop and mature, smart
    cities shall sooner or later function on a network of established blockchain solutions.
