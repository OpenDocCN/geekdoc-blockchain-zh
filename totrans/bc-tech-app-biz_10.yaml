    today. It can transform the business world and the organizations'' functions.
    It offers several possibilities to flourish existing businesses, grow entirely
    new ones, and severely disrupt traditional organizations. This chapter aims to
    study the applications of blockchain in procurement, to improve at the same time
    effectiveness and sustainability, and to define its critical success factors.
    The chapter presents a model and then describes its application in a real business
    case. It highlights the critical challenges in this blockchain implementation
    and the potentials of blockchain in managing sustainable procurement in support
    of utilities. This blockchain application is for smart metering. The blockchain
    solution contributes to the three bottom lines: economic, social, and sustainable.
    It can help support sustainable procurement, reduce errors, improve organizational
    functions and procedures, and prevent fraud. The chapter includes some challenges
    and their possible remediations.'

    They are computer programs that automatically execute a contract or part of it.
    Technically, they are code stored on a blockchain solution, triggered by blockchain
    transactions, and read and write data in that blockchain database. Smart contracts,
    based on blockchain technology, could reduce infrastructure costs of financial
    institutions from 13.8 to 18.4 billion euros annually by 2022 (Probst et al.,
    2016). They could save time and reduce costs in standard transactions. Smart contracts
    ease, verify or enforce a digital agreement. These programs potentially replace
    notaries, lawyers, and financial institutions when handling some legal and business
    transactions.

    1960s as concerns towards the degrading environment and poor resource management
    began growing (McKenzie, S., 2004). Stakeholders are now becoming more aware of
    social and environmental sustainability. Thanks to this awareness, organizations
    are making efforts to adapt and become more responsible and sustainable. These
    efforts imply that sustainability should become a significant part of the organization's
    processes, including procurement (Meehan, J. et al., 2011).

    large scale. Sustainability and its role in procurement is a more recent topic
    in scientific literature. According to Millington, A. (2008), social and environmental
    sustainability in corporations is a 21^(st)-century phenomenon. Many researchers
    have explored the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain management (Treiblmaver,
    H. 2018; Saberi, S. et al., 2019), including supply chain coordination (Tian,
    F. 2016). Blockchain's potential applications could enhance the sustainability
    of the supply chain since this technology can precisely and securely identify,
    verify, exchange, and store data. Blockchain solutions can bring supply chain
    transparency to a new level and expose incorrect practices (Tian, F., 2016). Saberi,
    S. et al. (2019) investigated activities across and within a supply chain and
    then provided valuable insights into the diversified sustainability-oriented opportunities

    in the future will change. The relationships with partners are essential for the
    success of the organizations. It is important not to refer to a linear supply
    chain but to a value network (Nicoletti, B. 2018). The procurement goal is not
    simply delivering products or services but adding value to customers and the organization.
    In this vision, the procurement needs to work as a coordinator of the network
    of partners. The ecosystem must work as one team. Access to the same data in a

    capability of the organizations. This capability includes the ability of the organizations

    When applying the blockchain to the physical world (for instance, smart grid,

    to the customers by sharing data with them. Smart meters have specific functions
    that allow generating a large amount of data, thus covering every variation and
    sending them correctly in real-time or within minutes. Users who acquire more
    knowledge of their consumption and potential waste can modify their behavior,
    improve energy savings, and reduce pollution. Currently, the most used process
    for data exchange takes place with Integrated Information Systems (IIS). These
    systems take care of collecting and processing data coming from the meters centrally.
    These systems receive the validated data, while the users do not have access to
    validated data. Subsequently, IIS will transmit some data to the users. The current
    process relies on the data flow provided by the utility vendors. The application
    of blockchain solutions could allow a different approach, no longer based on the

    in identifying waste, but it consumes energy to process the blockchain's operations.
    High consumption of resources, particularly electricity, depends on the blockchain
    consensus mechanism, where miners constantly compete to mine the next block for
    a high reward (Weber, I. et al., 2017). This approach can be seen as wasteful,
    but it is just a slight indication of the vast duplication of effort in proof-of-work
    mechanisms. Alternatives to the proof-of-work, like proof-of-stake, have been
    discussed for a while and would be much more efficient (Bentov, I. et al. 2016).
    At the time of writing, they remain an unproven but exciting alternative. Proof-of-work
    makes prevalent assumptions in trusting other participants, which is well suited
    for an open network managing digital assets, like in the smart metering case examined,
    especially thanks to the SIMs used in this solution.

    services shows the benefits and challenges of blockchain solutions supporting
    responsible procurement and their remarkable impact on sustainability also in

    to ensure transparency to customers and end-users, remove potential problems linked

    systems represents a step forward in using cutting-edge systems in data collection.

    limitation. The chapter defines its characteristics and limits. In some countries,
    there is still a need for a technological push that allows adequate instruments
    to reach the standards of more advanced countries. There is still minor sensitivity
    of data exchange and sustainability issues.

- en: Blockchain solutions support the integration of smart meters with a system suitable
    for exchanging data transparently and securely, thanks to the decentralized characteristics
    of the blockchain nodes and the security that this helps to provide. Through the
    automatic exchange of large quantities of data, it is possible to control and
    evaluate when waste occurs and, based on this information, to use ad hoc solutions
    that compensate customers' needs, avoiding the waste of resources.

    The organizations providing the meters would have a register to keep all the necessary
    information to avoid short circuits and manage customer relationships more effectively.

    such as scalability and the cost of managing multiple operations. A private blockchain

- en: The interest of researchers is increasing in the application of blockchain solutions
    to procurement. Blockchain is an effective technology for supplying economy security
    and privacy in procurement. However, it is essential in future research to find
    better solutions for scalability, lack of expertise, and high transactional costs
    of blockchain solutions. A lack of international standards is another significant
    obstacle to the widespread adoption of these innovative solutions.

- en: Another challenge using blockchain solutions is the energy consumption of the
    mining process in the case of proof of work (Vukolić, M., 2015). A new wave of
    blockchain methods will appear in the future, where different mining algorithms
    will be combined depending on the specific use case. Blockchain solutions introduction
    will improve sustainability, traceability, support transparency, and increase
    sustainable products' market share, leading to less CO2 and NOx emissions for
    the involved products.

- en: The more exciting use of blockchain in procurement supports a fundamental change
    in the organizations' structures (Nicoletti, 2017), a value network makes up an
    organization's operations in which the different paths allow advanced customization
    of the product. The aim of digital procurement is not simply delivering products
    or services to add value to customers and the organization. In this new vision,
    the procurement needs to work as a coordinator of the network of partners. The
    ecosystem must work as one team. More research into this new role of procurement
    is necessary.

- en: It would be interesting to analyze the SMS solution proposed in more depth in
    support of the new profile of a prosumer. This profile is possible thanks to the
    new scenario of lowering the cost of electricity generation technologies thanks
    to renewable energy. This new scenario changes the role of end-users from being
    simple consumers to producers of energy (Olivares-Rojas, J, C, et al., 2021).
    This new role has been called a prosumer and has contributed to modifying electricity
    markets by allowing prosumers merchandizing the energy surplus to electricity
    companies and other prosumers. Smart meters systems support this new scenario.
    It is interesting to analyze a distributed energy management algorithm taking
    full advantage of blockchain technology. It serves as a one-day-ahead energy schedule
    that allows each networked entity to make peer-to-peer (P2P) secure power trades
    with the other microgrid agents to develop sustainable solutions (Sivianes, M.
    et al. 2021). Smart meters can help in peer-to-peer energy trading supporting
    market auctions. Mengelkamp et al. (2018) constructed an auction mechanism where
    smart meters can measure and predict each user's demand and production capacity
    and subsequently broadcast this information. Based on this information, it would
    be possible to compute excess demand or supply and send this information to the
    corresponding blockchain account of the agent. Hahn et al. (2017) presented a
    distributed auction system where a seller with excess power can launch a new auction
    and publish his/her available power in the blockchain. Bidders in need of electricity
    can bid after receiving this information. Smart contracts automate the auction
    and payment processes, and smart meters detect and report the flow of electricity
    during the transaction, verifying the completion of the transaction.
