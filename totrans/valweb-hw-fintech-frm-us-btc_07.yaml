- en: Having discussed CheBanca! as a digital bank with branches, we will now examine
    the characteristics of a digital bank. Digital banks are being created in response
    to the development of the ValueWeb through FinTech. As a result of these pressures,
    incumbent banks are being forced to become digital banks. Banks cannot compete
    with new FinTech start-ups if they do not become digitalised. Equally, banks cannot
    deal with global peer-to-peer connectivity through the mobile network if they
    are not digital. They cannot support the exchange of value for free, if they are
    not digital. But what exactly is a digital bank?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am asked this question often. A digital bank is designed for the digital distribution
    of data through the globalised network of the internet; a traditional bank is
    designed for the physical distribution of paper in a localised network of branches.
    In other words, digital turns traditional banks on their head.

    however.

    through digital augmentation. It is built specifically to offer the customer the
    service of their choice through their access point of choice. The bank, therefore,
    has to be designed and created upon a digital core infrastructure. The digital
    core is a consistent enterprise-wide, cleansed data store that is accessible internally
    and externally through a strata of access layers. In other words, the start point
    of a digital bank is to be IP-enabled at its core. No legacy. No barriers, except
    those that avoid fraud and cyber attacks.

- en: • Second, the digital bank then creates outreach through access. That access
    can be both physical and digital, but it’s outreach to the digital core on the
    basis of providing customer choice. In other words, the customer may visit a branch,
    call the contact centre, make a comment on Twitter or Facebook, or touch the bank’s
    mortgage offers via a Google search. Because the bank has a digital core, it will
    be aware of all these access points and touches, and will respond accordingly
    and consistently. For example, if the customer has researched mortgage deals online
    the previous night, checked the latest interest rates on the app in the morning
    and walks into the branch at lunchtime, the bank will be ready with their mortgage
    specialists at hand—possibly through a videolink to a small branch—to provide
    the advice needed for the customer to make the decision over the mortgage deal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Third, the digital bank has an organisation that is geared to digital. The
    main form of customer outreach is through social media on the network, via video
    to advisors, and focused upon being at the point of relevance to the customer
    in their daily life. It focuses upon augmenting the customers’ life through digital
    outreach, but recognises the importance of the customer engaging directly face-to-face.
    The human contact through the network is the magical touchpoint. All other functions
    are geared towards removing friction through digital enhancement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Fourth, the digital bank will have an innate knowledge of the customer. They
    will leverage data as a competitive differentiation, and see a single view of
    the customer as the ultimate view. They will know that data association and predictive,
    proactive, proximity-based service is the place they will win.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Finally, the digital bank will have a boardroom that sees digital as their
    culture, rather than a project. The bank does not have a digital team or a budget
    for digital. They have integrated digital into their core, and see it as the duty
    of everyone in the bank to identify how to use digital series to touch the customer
    better, at lower cost and with an intimacy and data differentiation far more fit
    for the digital age. In other words, an Amazon-style processor of finance, rather
    than a Barnes & Noble.

    many reasons why I believe financial institutions need rebuilding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we originally built systems in the 1960s based on automating transactions
    in the back office on a mainframe. The transactions were the debit and credit
    accounting ledgers, and the information derived from branch-based operations.
    In the 1970s, we implemented 3270 green screens in branches to feed those mainframes
    with data for the transaction ledgers. This was a cost-cutting, administrative
    and efficiency play. It worked. In the 1980s, we introduced ATMs to the network.
    The ATM was designed to get rid of tellers, and have become the main physical,
    electronic outreach point for most banks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the 1990s, the next major electronic movement was to remote customer support
    through the telephone call centre. Already, by this time, banks had multiple legacy
    systems created through M&A, expansion of offers and disparate IT strategies.
    Most banks had multiple head office systems on multiple provider platforms, because
    they built their deposit account administration on IBM, for example, but then
    introduced insurance, mortgages, cards and other product lines from other specialists,
    from Unisys to Fujitsu to Amdahl. This is why most call centre customer service
    representatives were already struggling by 1999, because they had to access multiple
    systems across multiple platforms to get a comprehensive customer view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result was that the central, head office based focus was securely cemented
    by 2000, thanks to the previous quarter-century developments of systems, and much
    of this focus was upon transaction processing for internal branch and call centre
    support.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from internal to external.
  prefs: []

- en: It was at this point that we started talking about multichannel support, as
    we had to make what was previously only visible internally, external. We had to
    give customers online banking, and so we had to rethink the internal machine.
    Most banks didn’t. They just took the internal machine, and stuck a front-end,
    internet bank access on it through a username and password. That is why most banks’
    internet banking looks just like a bank statement, because that’s just what it
    is—an online access to the bank statement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We got away with offering an online access to a bank statement for a decade,
    but then the smartphone appeared with apps and real-time, and the emperor’s lack
    of clothing became visible. Most banks tried to move their head office focused
    internal systems from big screens onto small screens, but it just didn’t work.
    It didn’t work because it’s not real-time, it’s batch. It didn’t work because
    it’s focused upon internal cost cutting, not customer experience. It didn’t work
    because it supported staffers, not users.

- en: The trouble is that the back end is still a half-a-century old layer of mess
    that needs sorting out. In fact, banks are cemented in legacy mess, which is why
    they talk about channels. Branch was layered on the mainframe; ATM another layer;
    call centre the next one; internet banking the last one; and mobile the latest.
    Each layer we call a channel, and now we talk about “omnichannel integration”.
    What complete rubbish.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no such thing as a digital channel. The reason there is no such thing
    as a digital channel is that a channel is just a layer on a legacy. It is growing
    the legacy. So when I hear banks talking about omnichannel or digital channel,
    I know that they are just adding layers to legacy. And it will not work. It will
    not work because the legacy is based upon a physical infrastructure view, i.e.,
    a structure built in the last century for the physical distribution of paper in
    a localised network. We now need to rebuild this for the digital distribution
    of data in a globalised network. And the problem is that you cannot rebuild this
    from the front-end. You have to start rebuilding this from the core.
  prefs: []

    to analyse risks through social networks. They can create a “trust score” that
    adds multi-dimensional analysis of all the financial and social data out there

    the landlord who wants to ensure the prospective tenant is trustworthy; the microcredit
    farmer who now wants a bank account; the migrant worker who is a new country and

    by the industry to £2.18 billion, more than double the figure at the end of 2013\.
    It looks likely to double again in 2015 and, based on Zopa’s forecasts, will continue
    for the foreseeable future. Zopa themselves have seen year-on-year doubling of
    cumulative lending for the past five years.

    It is the same with Venmo. Venmo’s processing power is doubling year-on-year ($700
    million processed Q3 2014 vs $1.6 billion Q2 2015). In fact, through FinTech attacking
    payments and credit markets, there’s a strong likelihood that, in ten years, a
    significant part of bank profits and margins will have moved to new start-up companies.
    So the bank has to adapt within ten years to be more like a FinTech firm. Maybe
    sooner.

    this view that they already have millions of customers who are unlikely to switch
    to alternative providers that are untrusted, unproven and unlicensed. OK. That
    is the luxury of today that will give you the ten years to change and adapt without
    losing overnight. That is the cushion of today.

    that is cheaper, more transparent, more convenient and easier to use. Think how
    fast things change. Ten years ago, taxi drivers felt secure, Nokia and Blackberry
    ruled the world, Washington Mutual and Royal Bank of Scotland were the most respected
    banks in the world and China was irrelevant. It’s a little bit different today.

    from the Italian banks, who listened dutifully to my messages. The feedback forms
    were mainly 8, 9 and 10 out of 10s, but there were two or three that gave me 1–3
    out of 10 mark. Now I don’t mind that, because I reckon I’m a bit like Marmite.

    Instead of being built for the digital distribution of data in a networked world,
    they were established for the physical distribution of paper in a localised world.

    apart and rebuild. Look at everything, from product to process to people, and
    work out how fit you are for this digital age. Are there others doing it better?
    Should you manufacture the cloud services, APIs and apps for the product, process
    and people; or should you assemble and integrate them? Do you recognise that you’ve
    been vertically disintegrated and that customers can build their own banks? Can
    you compete?

    customers and employees hate you. I show them the Millennial Disruption Index,
    which clearly shows that the under 35s hate banks. They would rather go to the
    dentist than visit the bank (71 percent) and are desperate for a Google or Amazon
    to take over (73 percent).
