- en: Reducing toxicity in construction materials is paramount to improving the sustainability
    of the construction industry. This necessitates better knowledge of the content
    of these materials or products. However, there is no central register nor mandated
    ledger of component materials. Furthermore, from a global supply chain management
    perspective, it is very difficult to have access to full value chain information
    even from the manufacturer of the final product. This chapter explores ways to
    establish a supply chain ledger to track components of construction materials
    by using blockchain technology; to provide reliable and fully disclosed information
    on their chemical content and providence. It focuses on the example of PVC, but
    its findings are relevant to the manufacture of any other products from different
    component parts or materials. The findings depend on what are the most desirable
    features in supply chain networks. But, in general, the most suitable solution
    appears to be a permissioned blockchain using a proof of authority consensus mechanism.
    Such a system can be a closed, private network, with a set of verified and trustworthy
    stakeholders as participants that provide public verification via a device such
    as a QR code. Such a system is fast and can accommodate a large number of transactions
    per second, so can thus scale up in the future even if a network starts small.
    Given the concern with tracing materials for the purposes of sustainability, the
    chapter also highlights the issue of energy consumption, which is necessary for
    maintaining the blockchain itself, and suggests that this should be a relevant
    feature in the design of any supply chain system. The framework of analysis emphasises
    the complexities in choosing the various technical and non-technical aspects of
    any such supply chain systems. Nevertheless, it is achievable with existing, bespoke
    blockchain-based solutions, as is illustrated with the PVC supply chain network.

    For example, construction contributes significantly to global warming: according
    to the United Nations Environment Programme [[61](#CR61)], when adding emissions
    from the building construction industry on top of operational emissions, the sector
    accounted for 38% of total global energy-related CO[2] emissions. Also, by volume,
    the construction industry makes a very significant impact: it contributes well
    over 40% of global extractions of natural resources [[51](#CR51), [52](#CR52)],
    and subsequent construction and demolition waste disposal, can contribute more
    than two-thirds of total municipal waste generated [[18](#CR18)]. Toxicity of
    construction materials is also an issue: it is well known that toxicity in construction
    materials can have an adverse impact not only on the building users, but also
    on the natural environment [[43](#CR43), [45](#CR45)]. Therefore, improvements
    in how the construction industry removes toxicity from the materials could have
    a very real positive impact on human and planetary health.'

- en: Currently, it is challenging to find detailed information on all chemicals used
    in the production of construction materials, and especially to ensure that these
    are not toxic. Yet an increasing number of sustainability labelling schemes, including
    the Living Building Challenge, require such information [[31](#CR31), [39](#CR39)].
    Many synthetic materials are comprised of a number of components that are manufactured
    in various facilities by different companies dispersed geographically, making
    it very difficult to obtain access to full value chain information, even from
    the manufacturer of the final product. A real challenge is how to provide such
    information in a way that effectively captures the difference between different
    variations of the same core material manufactured in more than one country, under
    different regulatory frameworks. Developing upon the existing work by Petrović
    [[46](#CR46), [47](#CR47)], this chapter explores if Blockchain technology can
    offer real opportunities to assist with tracking and reporting the issues with
    toxicity as the materials are manufactured. Emerging digital technologies offer
    real opportunities for innovation in terms of how to drive change in this area.
    To this end, this chapter evaluates the effectiveness of blockchain technology
    for collecting such information, and explores how blockchain technology can be
    applied to identify the toxicity of construction materials. The particular focus
    is on establishing the applicability of blockchain technology for sharing information
    on the sustainability of construction materials, by providing reliable and fully
    disclosed information on their chemical content and provenance.

    established in the earlier work, there is a range of issues with the toxicity
    of PVC and its manufacture [[47](#CR47)]. For this reason, PVC is a good example
    for exploring potential blockchain applications aimed at an effective recording
    of toxicity information in construction materials. This chapter develops upon
    the earlier work by identifying a range of key thresholds in the manufacturing
    value chain, where records would be required as part of normal contractual and
    financial transactions between companies. Based on this, the chapter proceeds
    to evaluate the (blockchain) technical frameworks suitable for the management
    of such records.

    for sustainability is the ongoing energy consumption, which is necessary for maintaining
    the blockchain itself. This could question whether blockchain technology can be

    the potential for using blockchain transactions for construction material selection

    that are necessary for any applications of this nature.

    on the results of the previous projects and summarises elements of findings from
    these [[46](#CR46), [47](#CR47)]. Currently, the construction industry is the
    single most significant user of PVC, representing as much as about 60–70% of its
    total consumption [[10](#CR10), [28](#CR28)]. Because of its toxicity, Greenpeace
    has been campaigning for a global ban on PVC/vinyl manufacture for the past 30 years
    [[25](#CR25)]. Similarly, some of the more progressive systems in architecture
    already identify PVC as an issue. For example, the Living Building Challenge insists
    on the removal of all chemicals from their Red List, which stipulates chlorinated
    polymers, thus including all PVC products [[31](#CR31)]. Yet, despite these limitations,
    PVC is the third largest commodity plastic [[67](#CR67)], and in 2016, world consumption
    of PVC was around 40 million tonnes, and this is still expected to rise by 2.3%
    per year until 2024 [[10](#CR10)]. It is thus an important product to consider
    in relation to sustainability.

    films, profiles, sheets, fastening elements, flooring, wallpaper, and coatings.
    Therefore, any significant changes in construction applications could have a direct
    impact on global production and consumption of this toxic material. While the
    full phasing out of PVC is the best long-term approach, by examining the supply
    chain of PVC, this chapter contributes to raising the awareness of how problematic
    its use is, and maps out the series of steps for the potential application of
    blockchain technology in tracking toxicity in construction materials.

    and therefore classified as a Group A by the US Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) [[16](#CR16)]. It is toxic to cardiovascular, liver, organ development,
    and immune systems, genotoxic, and harmful to aquatic life [[48](#CR48)]. In 2017,
    the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ranked vinyl chloride
    fourth on the Substance Priority List, after arsenic, lead, and mercury [[2](#CR2)].

    of vinyl chloride starting with two studies undertaken in 1930 at the Pittsburgh
    Experiment Station of the US Bureau of Mines and focused on assessing acute toxicity
    from single exposure to guinea pigs [[44](#CR44), [50](#CR50)]. Although high-level
    exposure led to the deaths of testing animals, harmfulness of vinyl chloride was
    reported in relative terms, emphasizing that there was no observed damage at lower
    levels of exposure and by comparing these to other chemicals, leading to a suggestion
    of its possible use for surgical anaesthesia [[44](#CR44)], and subsequent research
    on such applications [[41](#CR41)].

    on studies of liver cancer and angiosarcoma of the liver in workers involved with
    the production of vinyl chloride or PVC [[30](#CR30)]. Subsequently, in many countries,
    regulations were set to limit exposure to vinyl chloride. These vary between countries,
    but even with low exposure limits which are considered to minimise the potential
    for cancer [[64](#CR64)], it is recognised that vinyl chloride might cause damage
    to other systems.

    as sodium chloride (table salt), unfortunately, a number of issues have also been
    observed with many synthetically generated organic chemicals which contain chloride.
    It is most alarming that chloride-containing chemicals tend to be persistent organic
    pollutants [[57](#CR57)]. In plastics, a number of chlorinated polymers have been
    developed often with excellent performance properties, such as chlorinated polyethylene
    (CPE), chlorinated polyvinylchloride (CPVC), and chlorosulfonated polyethylene
    (CSPE), which have all been introduced into the construction industry [[4](#CR4)].
    However, chlorinated polymers can contain volatile components which can be released
    while in use, and it is increasingly known that the use of such products can lead
    to the potential for the release of dioxins and other issues [[4](#CR4)]. Consequently,
    there has been a reduction in the manufacture of many such materials. The exception
    to this trend is the use of chlorine in PVC.

- en: However, vinyl chloride is not the only risk associated with PVC. On its own,
    PVC is a white powdery dust, which is why it took more than 50 years after it
    was discovered for its potential application to be recognised [[3](#CR3)]. In
    order to make this powdery dust to be useful, other materials need to be added
    to it. The most common additives are heat stabilisers, fillers, pigments, gliders,
    and plasticisers [[12](#CR12)]. The most important additives are heat stabilizers
    and gliding agents which stop thermal decomposition during processing and moulding
    [[67](#CR67)]. Otherwise, PVC would thermally decompose into VCM. Historically,
    common stabilizers included heavy metals, such as cadmium, lead, tin, and zinc,
    only recently have such toxic heavy metals cadmium and lead begun to be removed
    from PVC, even when PVC is used for water supply piping [[59](#CR59), [67](#CR67)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other common PVC additives improve the appearance of the product and, if needed,
    add flexibility. Plasticisers are commonly used to increase flexibility and achieve
    transparency of PVC, and for this, often plasticisers might be used in fairly
    high proportions as 10–60% of the final PVC products [[37](#CR37)]. There is a
    range of substances that can be used as plasticisers including phthalates, aliphatics,
    epoxy, terephthalates, trimellitates, polymerics, and phosphates [[29](#CR29)].
    Phthalates have been the group of the most commonly used plasticisers, until the
    increase in recognition of issues associated with phthalates. Since 2008, an increasing
    number of phthalate plasticisers have been listed as substances of very high concern
    [[20](#CR20)]. Plasticisers have been known to be released from the plasticised
    PVC while in use, and this tends to be the area of most recognised concerns when
    it comes to PVC in use [[46](#CR46)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, in recent years, replacement substances for the heavy metal stabilizers
    and the phthalate plasticisers have tended to be introduced without being thoroughly
    tested for their impacts on human health [[46](#CR46), [47](#CR47)]. One of the
    core problems with the use of PVC is that it will always require the use of a
    number of additives, and additives tend to be released relatively easily from
    the polymer mixture under a range of conditions while in use, during disposal,
    or while recycled. The toxicity of the additives used means that any release can
    have adverse health effects, human and environmental. However, if it is not known
    what is in any particular PVC product, no one knows exactly what or how to provide
    for it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to these problems caused by toxic additives, there are many other
    issues of toxicity related to the manufacture, use, and disposal of PVC [[47](#CR47)].
    Figure [1](#Fig1) summarises the key issues, by signalling toxic steps in red.
    For example, mercury or asbestos are commonly used as part of the process for
    obtaining the initial ingredients for PVC [[17](#CR17), [22](#CR22), [34](#CR34),
    [36](#CR36), [40](#CR40)]. For another example, the intermediate chemicals, such
    as vinyl chloride and ethylene dichloride, which have to be used in the manufacture
    of PRC are also toxic and are thus barriers to environmental sustainability [[20](#CR20),
    [47](#CR47), [48](#CR48)]. The final processing and shaping of the products use
    heat, which is associated with additional toxicity issues [[47](#CR47)]. Because
    of the range of different toxic ingredients and steps, it is hard to recycle the
    PVC without exposing workers to these toxins, and landfill disposal also causes
    them to leach into the environment over time. There are thus many human and environmental
    health problems potentially caused by PVC at the different stages of its life
    cycle. If they are to be avoided, the first step is to know what is in any particular
    PVC product. And for that, its production needs to be documented and tracked from
    start to finish.![](../images/504856_1_En_6_Chapter/504856_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png)

    production of low-end pipes, due to large amounts of toxic VCM residue. PVC produced
    via the ethylene process is used to produce ‘high-end’ PVC products, including
    doors and windows, pipes, and other construction materials [[8](#CR8)]. These
    products are used domestically and exported [[62](#CR62)]. In 2017, approximately
    85% of imported PVC floor, wall, and ceiling coverings in the United States (U.S.)

    PVC that are toxic, and can have adverse environmental and human health effects
    at the different stages of its life cycle. If we are concerned with managing the
    product in the best way so as to avoid the effects of PVC’s toxic components,
    we need to know all chemicals and substances, which form component parts of the
    resulting product. As it cannot be determined simply by looking at the final product,
    this information needs to be gathered throughout the process, especially where
    different companies manufacture different components. There thus needs to be some
    kind of ledger providing a record of these for each finished product.

    product to make an informed choice about its use. This applies to the intended
    end-use—such as by architect, builder or consumer—to its disposal afterwards,
    or even use by another manufacturer. If one PVC product is produced more sustainably
    than another, or without a particular toxic additive, then users will want to
    know this, and for there to be a verified and trusted statement about its component
    parts. Without such visibility, unsustainable practices can continue without anyone
    other than the manufacturer knowing. Certainly, in the absence of regulatory mechanisms
    within and between states, the only method of management for sustainability purposes
    will come via more open knowledge about the contents of the construction materials
    being considered. It is with this goal in mind that we now turn to the use of

    a set of trusted oracles are needed that can capture the information associated
    with the physical asset and upload this information to the blockchain. These would
    perhaps be a set of measurements, such as the weight of the acetylene batch collected
    by hardware oracles, which a software oracle could then verify and upload to the
    blockchain (oracles are discussed below). Once the digital mirror asset has been
    created, some kind of tags, such as a Radio Frequency Identification tag or a
    QR code, would be attached to the physical asset, linking it to the digital one.![](../images/504856_1_En_6_Chapter/504856_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.png)

    In the physical world, the asset is picked up for transit and sent to Company
    B. It would be possible for the courier to scan the physical asset’s tag upon
    pickup and then use special oracles to upload information to the blockchain, such
    as live location tracking and confirmation of delivery. Once the asset has been
    marked as delivered, smart contracts can be used to automatically send the digital
    asset to Company B’s wallet. When Company B processes the acetylene with chlorine
    to produce VCM, a new digital mirror asset is created for VCM. This digital asset
    is linked to the digital asset of the acetylene. The link between digital mirror
    assets is needed for the ability to track the production history of an asset.

    which is given to Company C through another transaction process.

    A non-permissioned blockchain allows anyone to join the network. This means that
    everyone in the system can interact anonymously without having to trust each other [[7](#CR7)].
    In a permissioned blockchain, a user requires access in order to join the network.
    This feature eliminates the ability to interact with the blockchain in an anonymous
    way. Permissioned blockchains are crafted to take advantage of blockchain technology
    without losing the central authority aspect of a centralized system [[32](#CR32)].
    For the purposes of supply chains, permissioned networks are most appropriate
    as they are faster and only expect to have a defined set of users adding information
    blocks to the ledger chain. Yet their advantages and disadvantages still need
    to be clear and identified in order to ensure the integrity of a system.'

    compared to a normal blockchain. This makes the process of verifying transactions
    much more efficient, because permissioned blockchains often have pre-determined
    nodes for performing the consensus mechanism. However, due to the small number
    of nodes in a permission blockchain, it is easier for the security of the system
    to be compromised. The security of a permissioned blockchain is proportional to
    the member’s integrity. If enough members work together, then information on the
    blockchain can be modified [[32](#CR32)].

    a few benefits. Updating the rules of the network can be completed much faster
    compared to a public network due to the smaller number of nodes. Every node in
    a permissioned blockchain works together to move the updates faster. However,
    there are also some drawbacks that come with having a governance structure and
    regulations. Having regulations on the network introduces censorship. An example
    of such censorship is where the central authority can choose to restrict a transaction
    or even stop it from occurring. This is a major threat to any of the organizations
    that are part of the system, because their cash flow can be interrupted at any
    time by the central governing authority.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the domain of blockchain technology, scalability refers to the ability of
    a blockchain to accommodate a growing number of users, while still retaining a
    fast consensus. Currently, public blockchains are unable to scale up because of
    the inefficiency of consensus protocols when used with large numbers of users.
    This inefficiency results in a longer ‘block time’, which is the time it takes
    for new blocks to be added to the chain. A long block time means that transactions
    on the network take longer to verify and complete. Permissioned blockchains often
    have much smaller block times compared to public blockchains. For example, Bitcoin
    (public and non-permissioned) has a block size of 1 megabyte that fits 2000 transactions
    [[26](#CR26)]. It takes approximately 10 min for one block to be mined and added
    to the chain, which results in a transaction throughput of 7 transactions per
    second. The Ethereum blockchain (also public and non-permissioned) can process
    a maximum of 20 transactions per second. In contrast, the permissioned HyperLedger
    blockchain can process up to 100,000 transactions per second [[58](#CR58)]. It
    is unclear how many transactions per second might be needed for the purposes of
    supply chain ledgers, but a permissioned proof of authority [[6](#CR6)] blockchain
    will be more scalable than those made using other formats.

    yet there is no central register nor mandated ledger of component materials. Moreover,
    for many synthetic materials, different components are manufactured in different
    facilities by different companies, making it very difficult to have access to
    full value chain information even from the manufacturer of the final product.
    Yet an increasing number of sustainability labelling schemes, including the Living

    that the use of toxics worldwide is producing adverse effects on environmental

    network. For example, for a generic, hypothetical supply chain, the most suitable
    solution appears to be a permissioned blockchain using a proof of authority consensus
    mechanism. Such a system can be a closed, private network, with a set of verified
    and trustworthy stakeholders as participants. Yet it can provide a public verification
    via a device such as a QR code at the end. Such a system is fast and can accommodate
    a large number of transactions per second, so can thus scale up in the future
    even if a network starts small. Yet, if there is a need to add smart contracts
    and use an existing technology, and no need for speed because of a small number
    of operators on a network, then perhaps one based on Ethereum might be more appropriate.
    Moreover, as technology evolves, this preference may change. For example, Ethereum
    2.0 aims to be much faster while still having the capability to attach smart contracts.
