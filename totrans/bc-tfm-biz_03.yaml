    [29], a paper was circulated among a small group of cryptography enthusiasts [30].
    In this paper, Satoshi Nakamoto [31] explained the concept of a cryptocurrency
    called Bitcoin^([1](#note1)) and a solution to the long-standing problem of double
    spending (where digital tokens representing unique value can be spent more than
    once) [32]. For years, double spending has been one of the main barriers to the
    widespread adoption of digital money. In 2008, the domain name [Bitcoin.org](http://Bitcoin.org)
    was registered, and at the start of 2009, the genesis block for bitcoin—that is,
    the first block in a blockchain—was created [30]. At that point in time, nobody
    foresaw the impact that Nakamoto’s [31] underlying technology would have on the
    world’s largest organisations, trusted intermediaries, and society at large [33].

    technology,^([2](#note2)) has rapidly gained popularity. Although ledgers have
    been around for millennia, for the first time in history they can be updated across
    multiple organisations and computer networks simultaneously through the use of
    blockchain technology. This functionality significantly reduces the possibility
    of ‘gaming’ the system, that is, the distributed and decentralised nature of the
    blockchain ledgers prevents any single party from controlling, and therefore manipulating,
    the ledgers. The cryptography underlying blockchain ensures a ‘trustless’ system,
    thereby removing the need for intermediaries to manage risk. This is a true paradigm
    shift and it is why so many organisations are exploring Blockchain’s potential
    use to improve their tracking and audit systems.^([3](#note3)) Although blockchain
    technology has only been around for less than a decade, businesses, government
    organisations, and consortia alike have significantly invested in this modern
    phenomenon, with a view to exploiting it for their financial or political gain
    [31]. Marc Andreessen, from the well-known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz,
    calls it as big an invention as the internet. Palychata [34], a research analyst
    from BNP Paribas, compares the creation of Blockchain to the invention of the
    steam or combustion engine, whereas The Economist predicts that it will be as
    important an innovation as the invention of Limited Liability Corporations [35].

    Partnership’s investigation into how the distributed ledger technology affects
    players in the financial industry. The R3 Partnership is a consortium of 80 of
    the biggest financial institutions. The R3 Partnership described its December
    2015 launch as the product of frustration among banks and other financial institutions
    with the multiple generations of disparate legacy systems that struggle to interoperate.
    In addition, six of the biggest global banks, led by Swiss bank UBS, have developed
    a ‘Utility Settlement Coin’ (USC) [36], which is the digital counterpart of each
    of the major currencies backed by central banks. Their objective is to develop
    a settlement system that processes transactions in (near) real-time, rather than
    days. The aim of the project is to enable global banks to conduct various transactions
    with each other using collateralised assets on a custom-built blockchain and to
    make financial markets more efficient [37]. A third example is Australia Post,
    which has released plans for developing a blockchain-based e-voting system for
    the state of Victoria, Australia [38]. The possibilities for the Blockchain are
    enormous and it seems that almost any industry that deals with some sort of transaction
    or tracking mechanisms can and will be disrupted by Blockchain. However, to understand
    how we should use Blockchain for social good, let’s first take a deep dive into
    the technology.

- en: A blockchain is a shared and decentralised public or private ledger that describes
    a single version of the truth of ownership [39–41]. It is a distributed ledger
    that uses database technology to record and indefinitely maintain an ever-growing
    list of data records [42], which cannot be tampered with and are irreversible,
    verifiable, and traceable [33, 42, 43]. At first, these data records were bitcoin
    transactions, but applications have now moved to any type of online transaction
    across any industry. Blockchains can serve as a record keeper for societies, including
    registration of any type of document or property [44]. Data records are stored
    chronologically in blocks that are chained together cryptographically. Every node
    in the network has a copy of the block and, in order for a transaction to be added
    to a chain, there has to be a consensus among the nodes in the network.

    for a centralised certifying authority, such as a bank, which usually takes a
    small commission to carry out the work. The removal of third parties, and the
    ability of organisations and consumers to execute peer-to-peer transactions almost
    instantaneously, is a true paradigm shift. In essence, this is what makes Blockchain
    so important.

    determines how actors in the network interact with each other [33]. There are
    permissioned and permissionless blockchains, each with different characteristics,
    rules, and actors. Permissionless blockchains are public blockchains. The best-known
    example is the bitcoin blockchain. Trust within the system is created through
    game-theory incentives and cryptography [33]. This means that anyone interested
    in joining a particular permissionless blockchain can do so by simply connecting
    his or her computer to the decentralised network, downloading the application,
    and starting to process transactions. It is not necessary to have a previous relationship
    with the ledger and you do not need to be approved to join. If you want to start
    mining Bitcoin and supporting the Bitcoin network, simply go to [https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)
    and get started. A public, permissionless Blockchain is not owned by anyone and
    everyone can contribute.

    artificial incentives because all actors in the network are known to each other
    [33]. New actors have to be approved by existing participants in the network,
    which enables more flexibility and efficiency in validating transactions [33].
    Private blockchains are generally used by organisations that like to keep a shared
    ledger for settlement of transactions [45], such as within the financial services
    industry. They are owned and operated by a group of organisations and transactions
    are visible only to members of the network [45]. A good example of a private Blockchain
    is the Blockchain Settlement System developed by UBS and five other major banks
    in 2016 [36]. This Blockchain enables the four participating banks to discernibly
    improve settlement times among them and no other party has access to the Blockchain
    or can contribute to it.

    for both options, the main feature is that, once a transaction is approved and
    on the Blockchain, it cannot be changed or edited. Some of the larger fintech
    institutions (including China’s first private and fully digital bank, WeBank)
    are considering layering their online banking on to combinations of public and
    private blockchain networks [46]. However, since 2016, a third option has been
    developed. Accenture has patented an ‘editable Blockchain’, the history of which
    can be adjusted by a central authority. This is a bit of a contradiction, because
    the power of the Blockchain is that data, once validated, cannot be altered. However,
    Accenture claims that this type of Blockchain would be for private permissioned
    Blockchains only—used, for example, by the banks, where a central authority can
    manage the network under agreed governance rules [47]. This type of Blockchain
    would offer a ‘safety button’ that could, in fact, make the Blockchain safer to
    use.

    key, are mathematically related to each other. This relationship means that any
    data encrypted by one key (public key) can be decrypted only by the other (private
    key), and vice versa. It is impossible to encrypt data with a public key and use
    another public key to decrypt that data [49]. As a result, you can use a key pair
    to identify the owner of a certain digital asset. As the public key is publically
    available, any data encrypted with a related private key can be decrypted only
    by the corresponding public key. It works like a mailbox, where everyone has a
    key to deposit a letter to that mailbox, but only one person has the right key
    to open the mailbox and take the mail out of it.

- en: Each block of data on a blockchain receives a hash ID, as a database key, calculated
    by a Secure Hash Algorithm. A block’s hash is fixed. In other words, the hash
    ID allocated to the block never changes. Hash algorithms are used in a variety
    of components of blockchain technology, one of them being the hash ID, which is
    a unique string of 64 numbers and letters linked to data in each block. The US
    National Security Agency (NSA) has designed a second generation of cryptographic
    Hash Functions called Secure Hash Algorithms 2\. It includes SHA-256, a highly
    efficient Secure Hash Algorithm that creates a unique hash ID for every piece
    of data. Hash Algorithms create the exact same hash if the data is exactly the
    same [50]. Altering only one bit in the data will result in a completely new hash
    ID. The hash ID of a block that is added to a blockchain is the starting data
    for the next block, and as such the blocks are chained together. This means that
    if data in a block is changed, it will change the hash of that block, which in
    turn will change the hash in the subsequent block, etc. To tamper with the data,
    the blocks would have to be revalidated by consensus. This will not happen because
    the other nodes in the network do not have an incentive to work on ‘old’ blocks
    in the chain. Besides that, a blockchain keeps on growing, so it requires considerable
    computing power to revalidate old blocks, which simply makes it not worthwhile
    [51]. The hash makes data on a blockchain immutable and that it has not been changed
    over time verifiable.

    it began as a concept applied to politics and societies, it has become an important
    part of computer science [53]. Consensus algorithms ensure that connected machines
    are able to collaborate independently without the need to trust each other and
    can continue working even if some members of the network fail [53, 54]. There
    are a multitude of consensus algorithms that take different approaches to authenticating
    and validating values and transactions on a blockchain. Consensus mechanisms are
    key to any blockchain; due to the consensus algorithm, there is no longer the
    need to trust the other party and, as a result, decisions can be created, implemented,
    and evaluated without the need for a central authority [44, 54, 55]. The result
    is intermediary-free transactions, whether they be human to human, human to machine,
    or machine to machine [44].

    Actors in the network have to agree on the rules that govern the blockchain, and
    how these rules must be applied, before a blockchain is deployed. The nodes in
    the network execute an agreed-upon algorithm and a predefined majority must agree
    on the outcome. Consensus algorithms use cryptography to validate transactions
    (and thus decisions) and at the moment,^([4](#note4)) the two most common consensus
    algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW) and the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (PBFT), although new consensus algorithms are being developed constantly [56].
    PoW is commonly used in permissionless blockchains, whereas PBFT is used in permissioned
    blockchains. In addition, Proof of Stake (PoS) is another consensus mechanism
    that is currently being developed. It is highly experimental, used only in a few
    altcoins, and not yet mature. Although Ethereum is looking into switching to PoS
    and the EOS Blockchain will use a delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.

- en: A consensus algorithm solves the long-standing problem of double spending related
    to digital currencies. Double spending refers to actors who want to cheat the
    system by spending the same digital token more than once. With fiat money, this
    problem is solved through the usage of a central authority (that is, a bank).
    In a decentralised system, without a central authority, it can be solved by consensus.
    To understand the issue, Lamport and Shostak [57] proposed The Byzantine Generals’
    Problem, a thought experiment about a group of generals who are each commanding
    a different part of the Byzantine army and need to agree upon a plan to attack
    and conquer an enemy city. The generals can communicate only via messenger, but
    the problem is that at least one general is a traitor. The question is how many
    traitors can the army have and still function as one force? Every consensus algorithm
    is a Byzantine Generals’ Problem solution and the first algorithm that came up
    with a solution was the PBFT algorithm [58]. Since then, many PBFT algorithms
    have been developed, before Bitcoin was introduced. PBFT algorithms can be applied
    in a decentralised, permissioned network, meaning that a central aspect to PBFT
    algorithms is that a membership is required, which has to be approved by a centralised
    authority. The PoW algorithm solved this problem [31, 54]. This consensus algorithm
    operates in a decentralised network, without a central authority, but it assumes
    that most of the actors are ‘honest’ actors and reduces the risk of dishonest
    actors.

    innovation of a PoW is that it does not require membership. For this reason, a
    central authority is no longer required. The PoW algorithm is, therefore, used
    in public or permissionless blockchains, where actors do not have to know or trust
    each other. As such, it is used in the bitcoin blockchain, which is a public blockchain.
    This consensus algorithm requires participating actors to solve a difficult computational
    problem to validate the blocks. The validation is done using cryptography, which
    means that the actor has to find the solution of an inequality, which requires
    considerable computing power (and energy). When a solution is presented, it is
    immediately clear that it is correct. This can be compared with a crossword puzzle,
    which can be difficult to solve, but once completed you immediately know that
    it is done correctly. The moment an actor has solved the equation, the solution
    is presented to the whole network and the actor receives bitcoins as a reward
    (in the case of the bitcoin blockchain).

    approach. Within PoS, as within PoW, validators are selected randomly, but, where
    validators within PoW have a larger chance of being selected if they have more
    computing power, within PoS the amount of money (that is, the number of tokens
    or the amount of cryptocurrency) that a member holds determines the likelihood
    of being selected [59]. Once a block has been produced, a transaction fee is paid
    to that validator and signers commit the block to the blockchain. These signers
    can all be nodes in the network or a randomly selected group of nodes that do
    the signing for the complete network. To ‘incentivise’ nodes to hold a larger
    stake, the more stake a node has in the network, the less complex the puzzles
    the node has to solve. As a result, nodes that already have a large stake can
    easily become larger. PoS still requires a consensus agreement on the current
    state of the network, but the more crypto-coins an actor owns, the higher the
    stake in the success of a blockchain. As a result, PoS requires far fewer computer
    processing unit computations and therefore is more energy efficient [60]. The
    assumption underlying PoS is simple: if an actor has a higher stake in the system,
    they have a higher incentive to ensure that the network is secure and correct
    because of the pain felt when the price and reputation of the cryptocurrency are
    damaged, due to attacks. It is expected that the Ethereum network will implement
    a PoS consensus mechanism in 2018.'

    transaction occurred on the blockchain at a certain time. If an actor tries to
    cheat the system and offer the same transaction again, nodes will check the transaction
    against the timestamp and, if the transaction is found in a previous block, the
    nodes in the network will come to a consensus that the transaction is invalid.
    In addition, the timestamp feature, in combination with the hash, enables users
    to prove at any given moment that a certain document was owned by a particular
    user at a certain moment in time and that since then the document has not been

    and Wells Fargo from the USA used blockchain in, what was hailed as, the world’s
    first global trade transaction between independent banks for a shipment of cotton
    from Texas to Qingdao in China. Further, in December 2017, Dutch agriculture trading
    house Louis Dreyfus Co. collaborated with Dutch banks ING and ABN Amro, and French

    needs to happen when those preconditions are met. The protocol is then recorded

    contract is on a blockchain, it is final and cannot be changed (that is, they

    be altered only if the original code allows for this. Therefore, it is vital for
    organisations to ensure that the code is 100% correct and that no bugs or errors
    remain in the smart contract when it is recorded on the blockchain. Mistakes can
    be extremely costly, as we have seen with The DAO Hack which lost US$50 million

    smart contracts remove the need for developing, implementing, or evaluating decisions

    with artificial intelligence and big data analytics, it becomes possible to automate
    decision-making capabilities [44, 69]. This will result in a ‘fundamentally new
    paradigm for organising activity’ [44], automating (strategic) decision-making,

    predefined by a piece of code and linked to a database [75]. The example of the

    The only difference now is that, when they are deployed on the blockchain, they
    remain accessible indefinitely and will carry out their predefined tasks whenever
    certain conditions are met. Smart contracts offer tremendous opportunities for
    organisations, but it is vital that they are deployed on the blockchain only when
    they are correct. In the coming years, we will probably see a wide variety of
    applications using smart contracts that will change how we work, how we do business,

    ensue if smart contracts were deployed with bugs [73]. Incorrect smart contracts
    are, however, not the only challenge facing organisations wanting to move to a
    blockchain. The Blockchain is still a nascent technology and many (technical)
    challenges remain that need to be solved before wide-scale adoption becomes possible.

    are not the only possible application. Any transaction can be recorded on a blockchain
    [39]. Smart contracts can enable a wide variety of applications, not just those
    related to financial markets and/or ‘self-enforcing autonomous governance applications’
    [73]. The possibilities of Blockchain are, therefore, almost endless for organisations
    to create new, distributed products and services that will result in efficiency
    gains in existing organisational structures [33]. Such Blockchain-enabled products
    and services are commonly referred to as Decentralised Applications, or DApps.
    A DApp has at least two distinctive features [44]: (1) any changes to the protocol
    of the DApp have to be approved by consensus; and (2) the application has to use
    a cryptographic token, or cryptocurrency, which is generated according to a set
    algorithm. There are already quite a few examples of DApps, of which Bitcoin is
    of course the best known. An extensive list of all known DApps at the moment is
    available at dapps.ethercasts.com.'

- en: The development of such decentralised products and services will change organisation
    design. Blockchain does not require a centralised authority for maintenance, because
    the database is stored on millions of decentralised computers, and its decentralised
    infrastructure ensures that a single case of mismanagement, resulting in a point
    of failure, does not affect the entire network [45]. In addition, due to the trustless
    system based on cryptography, the usage of Blockchain and smart contracts will
    enable an organisation to control and reduce opportunism, while automating decision-making.
    This will, in turn, have a direct impact on organisation design [55] and any legal,
    regulatory, IT, and accounting frameworks [72]. Blockchain removes the need for
    trust in the absence of a centralised governing body. It therefore follows that
    any organisation developing DApps should still have a strong focus on data governance.
    After all, only data authenticity can be ensured; reliability and accuracy cannot.
    With Blockchain, it becomes possible to embed data governance directly within
    the network, bringing the code to the data [45]. Laws and regulations can be programmed
    into a blockchain itself, so that they are enforced automatically, which makes
    governance easier [78]. Hence, the ledger can act as legal evidence for data and
    increase the importance of data ownership, data transparency, and auditability.
    The resulting effect on organisation design could eventually result in the establishment
    of DAOs.

- en: A DAO is a combination of smart contracts linked together, possibly connected
    to Internet of Things devices, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence.
    It is run by immutable code under the sole control of a set of irreversible business
    rules [39]. A DAO will have different actors from today’s organisations; it will
    require extensive data governance processes that ensure data reliability and accuracy,
    and it will result in a fundamentally new organisational structure [44, 79–81].
    A DAO is a self-organising framework that uses automated decision-making based
    on consensus in which actors interact with each other without the need to trust
    each other. Within a DAO there is no traditional organisational hierarchy because
    hierarchy is determined by ownership (that is, how trusted an actor is as well
    as the merits earned by that actor as a result of behaviour). This change in organisational
    structure affects the balance of power. In traditional organisations, power is
    distributed either by hierarchy or by knowledge, and often these are related;
    the higher up the hierarchy, the more information you have and the more power
    you have within the organisation [82]. Within a DAO, this works differently. Power
    is determined by the number of tokens an actor owns, an actor’s trust level, and
    their achieved merits. This will shift the power balance within an organisation
    from a hierarchical structure to a distributed structure, thereby affecting the
    governance structure [83].

- en: 'In its simplest form, a DAO is just immutable computer code: one or more smart
    contracts linked together and deployed on a blockchain, encouraging actors to
    self-organise. The code defines governance within the DAO, because governance
    is the rules that are implemented within the smart contracts. With the functionality
    of blockchain technology, a DAO can be seen as a self-organising structure that
    uses consensus mechanisms to make automated decisions, without the need for trust.
    As a result, within a DAO, there is no traditional hierarchy (because there are
    no employees or managers), no traditional governance (because the code is the
    governance as the rules are embedded within the smart contracts), and it is not
    possible to email or call a DAO, except for interacting with chat bots (because
    the entire organisation operates automatically, without the need for people being
    involved). DAOs can, however, operate as traditional organisations, although they
    do this autonomously; they can order products and services, have customers and
    suppliers, and make profits or losses. It has the same activities as a traditional
    organisation; it needs to make money, it has costs, it has customers, shareholders,
    and even employees (although these are independent contractors), it offers a product
    or service, and it is subjected to regulatory requirements (although being a distributed
    company this becomes a lot more difficult since regulatory requirements could
    be contradictory across jurisdictions). Therefore, governance is important when
    developing a DAO and a governance structure should be incorporated within the
    DAO (within the code). In addition, one should ensure that the code of the DAO
    works and continues to function correctly for an indefinite amount of time because,
    once deployed on a blockchain, it becomes irreversible. Lack of governance or
    quality assurance can have major consequences, as was shown in The DAO Hack in
    2016 [84]. Therefore, in summary, actors who want to establish a DAO have to ensure
    that the right governance structure is implemented within the code and that the
    code works correctly to guarantee that the DAO can operate properly once deployed.'

    can call the taxis using an App, similar to the Uber App. Once the taxi has been
    ordered, it automatically picks up the passenger and drives him or her to the
    requested destination. The car automatically takes the best route, avoiding traffic
    and detours. Once the passenger leaves the taxi, the money is automatically transferred
    using a smart contract. The money that is received with the service is used to
    automatically service the cars if needed. Once a car notices that service is required,
    it automatically books an appointment with a car service station. The repairman
    automatically and immediately receives a report on what needs to be done and if
    any parts need to be ordered. After years of great service, the car notices that
    it has reached the end of its life and automatically drives itself to the car-recycling
    company. Some time before that, smart contracts ordered a new self-driving car,
    based on the demand it sees in the market. The moment the old car is recycled,
    the new car leaves the factory and picks up the first passenger. No manager, no
    employee will be involved in the entire process. Big data analytics is used to
    automatically improve the service, understand the customers, and monitor the cars.^([5](#note5))

    few challenges to be solved. After all, within a DAO, multiple actors, human and
    non-human, have to cooperate interdependently. Within such systems, mathematical
    models of conflict and collaboration can incentivise actors to act in the best
    interest for the system as a whole. DAOs are an exciting opportunity to redesign

    to as the cryptocoin or token. For years, start-ups have been looking for investors
    to invest in their venture to build the next Facebook or Google. However, money
    is expensive and any start-up that raises money has to give a share of the company
    to the investors. The earlier an investor joins, the higher the risk, and the
    more expensive it becomes for the entrepreneur. That has been the paradigm for
    the past decades. Not anymore. Since the rise of the Blockchain, times are changing.
    The latest method to raise funds for a new start-up has become the Initial Coin
    Offer, or ICO (also known as a Token-Generation Event).

    distributing a percentage of the initial coin supply [87]. Basically, with an
    ICO a start-up plays the role of a bank; it digitally creates money out of nothing
    and sells that to ‘investors’. The tokens, or cryptocoins, which are sold during
    the crowd sale will be used on the platform to pay for transactions and distribute
    value across the stakeholders. ‘Investors’ who purchase these coins during the
    ICO do not get a share in the start-up, but they hope that the price of the coin
    will rise and as such they can get a (substantial) return on their investment.

    data storage network, raised US$257 million in their ICO in September 2017\. Filecoin
    raised the record-breaking amount in less than a month. However, one of the earlier
    ICOs was that of Ethereum. In 2014, Ethereum raised US$18.4 million via the ICO
    of their cryptocoin Ether (ETH). At the time of the ICO, 1 Ether was worth ≈ US$0.31
    (2000 ETH for 1 BTC) and, at the moment of writing this book, 1 Ether has increased
    in value from US$11.27 to US$1228 and consequently dropped in value to US$600.^([6](#note6))
    Two other very successful ICOs have been Bancor, which raised US$153 million in
    five hours, and Block, which raised US$185 million in five days. At the end of
    2017, the secure messaging app Telegram announced their ICO to enable them to
    develop a decentralised ecosystem. In March 2018, they had already secured US$1.7
    billion in funding through their private token sale and, by the time you read
    this, it will be known how much they eventually raised. Of course, these fundraising
    activities also raise questions about purpose, trust, and governance. Notoriously,
    some ICOs and exchanges have operated Ponzi Schemes and other scams. Wherever
    there is money to be made, fraud and deceit are likely to follow. Some examples
    of these are discussed later in this book.

    the objective of the platform. As a result, ICOs are extremely high risk and,

    is no safeguard or guarantee at all for those who invest [88].

- en: Scalability is a major issue for blockchains, at least for public blockchains.
    The most popular blockchain, the Bitcoin blockchain, is by now 170 Gigabytes^([8](#note8))
    and is growing steadily at 1 MB per block every ten minutes. The idea of Blockchain
    is that every node in the distributed web has a complete copy of the blockchain.
    So, if you wish to start validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, you
    first have to download the entire blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A potential solution to the issue of scalability could be ‘blockchain pruning’.
    This basically means that nodes in the network use only a verified representation
    of the blockchain that contains the last few hundred blocks. The entire blockchain
    would still be available, but only on a few nodes. At the time of writing, there
    is a lot of discussion in the Bitcoin community regarding whether the size of
    the block should be increased to 2 or 4 MB. It is likely that scalability will
    remain an issue as the popularity of Bitcoin increases. In 2017, this scalability
    challenge resulted in a division among bitcoin miners. As a result, some miners
    decided to hard fork and create a new cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash, which enables
    up to 8-MB blocks. The size of the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain has since grown to
    159 GB.^([9](#note9))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scalability is less of an issue for private blockchains, such as Hyperledger,
    because they contain only nodes that have a direct interest in processing transactions.
    Although private blockchains are more expensive than a single centralised database,
    if you add up the costs involved in all those centralised databases replaced by
    the blockchain, it is still a lot cheaper.

    not all). IOTA’s distributed ledger (Tangle) is infinitely scalable at zero costs.
    However, the bitcoin blockchain does face significant transaction and cost challenges
    and, as it is the most-developed blockchain, we focus on the bitcoin blockchain.
    When Bitcoin was launched, everyone was excited about the almost negligible transaction
    costs. Sending money almost instantaneously across the globe was almost free of
    charge; this created a completely new world that bypassed the need for banks when
    it came to transferring money across the globe. However, things have changed.
    On 21 December 2017, the average transaction fee reached its highest level of
    US$54.90 per transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, if you wish to perform a small transaction, let’s say buying a coffee
    with bitcoin, this becomes impossible. If you use bitcoin to transfer large sums
    of money across the globe, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, such
    a fee is relatively cheap compared with what you would have to pay a bank. However,
    for a cryptocurrency to be widely accepted and potentially replace fiat currency,
    it should be usable by everyone for every type of transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cause for the high transaction fees lies in the fact that the sizes of the
    blocks are currently limited to 1 MB per block and almost each block is completely
    filled. For example, on May 4, 2018, the average block size^([10](#note10)) was
    974 kB, which means that every block is filled up with transactions. Bitcoin was
    created in such a way that miners who validate transactions have to use a tremendous
    amount of computing power (that is, energy). If there is an increasing demand
    for transactions to be validated, miners will prioritise transactions that pay
    a higher fee. Economics 101 dictates that, if the demand increases, but supply
    remains the same (number of transactions that can be validated per block), the
    price increases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason for the increased transaction fee is the newly created cryptocurrency
    Bitcoin Cash that split off from Bitcoin on 1 August 2017\. Bitcoin and Bitcoin
    Cash are very similar cryptocurrencies, which means that miners can easily switch
    from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash, if it becomes more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash
    (the rationale behind this has to do with how the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash protocols
    have been developed; if there are fewer miners, the mining difficulty goes down,
    and the possibility to make more money increases). Fewer miners on the Bitcoin
    network means less supply, which means an increased transaction fee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Of course, the Bitcoin community is aware of this and is attempting to implement
    solutions to increase the size of the blocks, thereby increasing supply and lowering
    transaction fees. There is an ongoing debate in the Bitcoin community related
    to block size, with multiple arguments in favour of and opposed to an increase
    in size. The reality is that, without a solution to this problem, the number of
    transactions per second remains limited, and the transaction fees will continue
    to increase. Or, as Vitalik Buterin [96], founder of Ethereum, said: ‘If [the
    niche of digital gold] is what Bitcoin users want, then they should keep the limit,
    and perhaps even decrease it. But if Bitcoin users want to be a payment system,
    then up it must go.’'

    It becomes a lot more difficult to hack and/or censor data, and the usage of the
    Hashcash Algorithm ensures that it is impossible to retrieve the hashed content.
    The Bitcoin blockchain itself has not yet been hacked, despite the fact that it
    has been around for almost a decade. However, many of the services surrounding
    it have. The DAO was hacked and subsequently almost lost US$50 million [90]. This
    was preventable only thanks to a ‘hard fork’. Mt Gox, the (at the time) world’s
    largest bitcoin exchange, was hacked and as a result US$460 million disappeared
    [97]. Further, Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange platform, lost US$70
    million [98]. More recently, in January 2018, the Japanese exchange Coincheck
    was hacked, resulting in a loss of US$660 million in NEM tokens. These hacks do
    not help the image of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Although bitcoin is
    only one application of Blockchain, these hacks distract the general public from
    its true value. People might not feel comfortable with these security concerns

    Bitcoin is a particularly unsustainable coin in terms of its energy consumption.
    The Proof of Work consensus mechanism requires tremendous amounts of computing
    power. According to VICE, in 2015 a single Bitcoin transaction used roughly enough
    electricity to power 1.57 American households for a day [99]. This results in
    an estimated annual energy consumption of approximately 16 terawatt-hours.

    terawatt-hours per year to power the Large Hadron Collider [100], an amount equal

    consumption of VISA [101] (which processed 82.3 billion transactions in 2016 [102],
    compared with the approximately 100 million Bitcoin transactions in 2017). With
    the potential increase in block size, the amount of energy required to solve the
    puzzles would continue to increase. In addition, given that most of the mining
    pools are in China, most of this energy consumption is driven by unsustainable
    coal-powered energy plants. Although it is possible that miners may switch to
    clean energy, there is still the problem that the mining of bitcoin is literally
    a waste of energy [103], because the complex computer calculations as part of
    the Proof of Work consensus protocol have no value at all. No world problems are
    being solved by the calculations, except to show that the calculations have been
    done. In an ideal world, we would see the development of a consensus algorithm
    that actually contributes to the public interest, similar to what was done with
    reCAPTCHA, which was used for training neural networks.

    legal issues into the light, particularly in Germany, which has some of the strictest
    privacy regulations. Even if there is an attempt to encrypt and hide personal
    information, it is still possible to glean statistical or meta-data. One solution
    is to store only encrypted data on a blockchain, but this leads to another problem:
    if the key to decrypt specific information is lost, the data may not be recovered
    accurately. Furthermore, if a key is stolen and published, all the data is forever

    can only manage seven to fifteen transactions per second. The promise from Ethereum

    This means that the Ethereum blockchain will remain secure while also allowing

    are stored in transparent and shared databases, and protects data from removal,
    corruption, or modification using a consensus mechanism and cryptography. The
    Hash Algorithm ensures that we can always control whether a document, ownership,
    or transaction has been altered. The immutability of records on a blockchain ensures
    that we can always go back to the origin of a transaction, to control or monitor
    who has been involved in that transaction across time and space. Apart from transactions,
    a blockchain can also store smart contracts, so-called If This Then That statements,
    albeit a lot more complex. These contracts are written in code, understandable
    across jurisdictions, and ensure that a certain action will automatically take
    place once certain pre-set conditions have been met. When you start combining
    one or multiple smart contracts with technologies such as big data analytics and
    artificial intelligence, it becomes possible to create DApps or even DAOs. A DAO
    is an organisation without management or employees, run completely by code, where
    (data) governance is enforced in the code. In this way, existing paradigms of
    how we should run an organisation are changed completely.
  prefs: []

    offer a glimpse of what the future holds. Blockchain is still in its early development
    and a lot of development work has still to be done. However, decentralised applications
    that are run by smart contracts, without the need for a centralised governing
    power that generally takes a large commission, offer tremendous advantages. They
    are cheaper and more efficient to run, more difficult to control by governments
    or centralised organisations, and more secure and transparent than existing applications.
    It is these technologies and applications (Blockchain, smart contracts, DApps,
    and even DAOs) that could contribute to solving Wicked Problems.
