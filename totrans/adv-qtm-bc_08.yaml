- en: Data collection mechanisms have become effectively advanced by leveraging the
    internet of things and cyber physical systems. The sensors are heavily developed
    with intricate details to capture data in varied forms which can be stored and
    used as an information base for knowledge extraction using analytics and statistical
    prognostication in artificial intelligence sub-branches. Storing this data with
    a different approach that ensures stringent security measures is done using blockchain.
    The loopholes that compromise the security of blockchain are quantum computing
    for which quantum resistant blockchain ideas are discussed. This chapter finally
    sheds some light on the effective approach to implement the CPS 4.0-based blockchain
    mechanism with detailed scrutiny.

- en: The world works with a lot of data collected on daily basis. The collection
    mechanisms of the data over the period of time have also became advance. The collection
    mechanisms are not only confined to numerical based data but also to multimedia
    data that is non-structured and documented type. The data collection is done using
    various modern-day sensors and attachments. This data requires lot feature engineering
    and a lot of expression can be given to it if utilized in a proper manner. Internet
    of Things (IoT) (Kumar S, 2019; Madakam S, 2015; Rehman H.u et al., 2017) and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) (Aguida, 2020; [Jazdi, 2014](#r51); Rawung et al.,2014)
    can be used for collection of the data in varied ways. IoT (Lakhwani et.al., 2020)
    systems are embedded and have many sensors that are connected through a micro-controller
    or micro-processor system that leverage the internet and cloud platform for connectivity.
    CPS also has many unit level sensors that work on physical level for collecting
    the data. This data is just collected form of information base from which knowledge
    can be extracted. The data collected from CPS/IoT can be used to perform many
    analytics and prognostication techniques for improving the state of the system.
    But this is not where the limitations are attained, another technology related
    to storing and management of data for better security and varied reasons is Blockchain
    ([Nakamoto, 2009](#r75); Vujicic et.al.,2018). The intricate details will be explained
    in the further section of the article but in easy terminology the blockchain is
    a data storing mechanism that ensures transparency and decentralized system. Blockchain
    are heavily encrypted and give the security their top most priority. All the blocks
    are heavily encrypted with real-time hashes and connected with a strong link that
    use redundancy to ensure all the blocks are at the same operating state throughout
    the transactions and operations. This however will be tackled with the use of
    quantum computing (Bhatt et al,2019; [Ladd et al,2010](#r60); [Jazaeri et al,2019](#r50)).
    The basis of current state-of-the-art systems fall less to break the blockchain
    because of the hash keys. These hash keys are not a challenge for quantum computer
    as it operates on quantum bits (qubits) which process many possibilities of one
    problem simultaneously. This is still a far-fetched problem as the number of qubits
    required to break the current state-of-the-art blockchain system is difficult
    but won’t be a problem in span of 10 years down the line. The quantum computers
    will easily be able to calculate the private key based on the public key in fraction
    of time which seems an impossible problem currently. Many suspicions are raised
    even before this has taken place that the quantum computers will replicate the
    hash performed and forge the transaction before the record is written on the block
    by replacing the hash. This process will be seamlessly easy yet many infractions
    are involved, but suspicion tingles the curiosity and it definitely has by forcing
    researchers to work with quantum resistant blockchain ([Allende et al,2021](#r6);
    Ferna’ndez et al,2020; [Zhang et al.,2021](#r110)) that discusses some ideas to
    make current blockchain more secure and unbreakable. Although many aspects are
    involved that the cryptographical algorithms required will have to be rewritten
    for a quantum computer in such fashion which will for sure differ from traditional
    systems. The integration of blockchain into CPS 4.0 ([Patel et al.,2022](#r79))
    industrial standard is another aspect for which this article discusses the idea
    in the further sections.

    between these is essential at many levels. The cyber physical systems (Aguida,
    2020; [Jazdi, 2014](#r51); Rawung et al.,2014) can be defined as interaction using
    network of physical and computational components engineered together. It can be
    also termed as a combination of varied technologies, viz. Artificial Intelligence,
    Machine Learning ([Alpaydin, 2020](#r7); [Sarker,2021](#r95); Shinde, et al. 2018),
    Deep Learning ([Goodfellow et al., 2016](#r35); LeCun,2015), Internet of Things
    (Kumar S, 2019;Madakam S, 2015;Rehman H.u et al.,2017), Big Data Analytics (Elgendy
    et al,2014) and Robotics. The main confusion that instills the mind of the people
    is difference between internet of things and cyber physical systems. The simple
    answer to this is internet of things is associated with objects that are connected
    with internet and eventually coupled together whereas cyber physical system is
    computation integration with network for physical process. The cyber physical
    systems allow recording of the data in a direct manner using the sensors of the
    system. The physical processes are affected using actuators. The thin line between
    the physical and digital world can be evaluated and saved easily using the cyber
    physical system. Creating a connection with each other on global scale is possible
    easily. It provides multi-modal human-machine interfaces for easier interaction.
    Generating information directly from the device is possible. Self-monitoring is
    possible as personal level IP-address is assigned. The cyber physical system 4.0
    (CPS 4.0) is industrial exposure of the traditional cyber physical system. It
    does empower the manufacturing sector with its latest advancement. The intent
    of connecting the existing physical systems with CPS 4.0 standard is current goal.
    If we breakdown the varied technologies involved, it is a clear indication of
    CPS implementation as data is the main required component of it and in this modern
    world, data is allocated on a very large level which can certainly leverage these
    technological areas. Starting with internet of things also abbreviated as IoT
    is connecting the sensor based micro-controllers and micro-processors with the
    internet for creating smart applications. The primary aspects of IoT are networking,
    communication, security, volume of the data used for solving a business problem
    and social impacts. The interconnected devices give an expression to IoT that
    transmit and receive data in massive volumes. Integrated circuits such as System
    on a Chip (SoC) (Martin et al.,2001) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
    (Zheng et al.,2001) can be used to collect the data in proper manner. The main
    powerful point of the IoT based system is using the network for cloud integration
    (Hiran K, et al., 2021). The cloud computing ([Mathew et al. 2017](#r71)) gives
    an expression to serving and using application programming interface (APIs). Real-time
    streaming and integration of various network based systems is easily possible
    using IoT based systems currently. The cloud also leverages the massive storage
    capacities of the data so that the devices need not be dependent on the on-chip
    storage system. A lot of analytics can be performed using this data and this is
    where the areas of data science will be used, which will be explained in this
    section in some time. The main task is managing the heterogeneous data and putting
    it to use. Time sensitive data can be used for generating latency and non-useful
    attributes can be discarded. The main considerable point for such system is internet
    which does open paths to various developments. The analytics can be performed
    on different levels. Artificial Intelligence is a very broad term and can be derived
    in many segments. It can be considered as an applied branch of statistics. Prognostication
    based models are the main constituent when related to IoT or CPS. The analytics
    is study of the collected data for providing the best business solution but Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged for creating the prognostication aspect for
    taking some sensor based decisions. The prognostication based learning can be
    linked with inferential statistics branch for which Machine Learning is the applied
    ([Mahrishi et al., 2020](#r69)) branch. Machine Learning in broader sense is associated
    with learning the patterns and parameters of the data to yield a prediction. This
    prediction is probabilistic so a lot of metric analysis is necessary to clear
    the infractions. The machine learning has many learning methods (Hiran K et al.,
    2021) and divisions that can be understood in detail. The learning methods broadly
    considered can be supervised learning ([Kotsiantis, 2007](#r56)) and unsupervised
    learning (La”ngkvist et al., 2014). The supervised learning is associated when
    the labels for the particular feature parameters of the data are given whereas
    for unsupervised learning the labels are not present and it is purely related
    to learning the pattern from the data. Both the learning procedures can be used
    when extracting the data from the IoT based system. Supervised learning has 2
    main divisions, viz. Classification ([Cormack, R.M., 1971](#r22)) and Regression
    (Maulud et al., 2020). The simple understanding of the classification is recognizing
    the object or entity from the set of given labels. Regression is prediction of
    the continuous values. Classification is discrete. Classification has types such
    as binary and multi-class. The binary classification (Kumari et al.,2017; [Gupta
    et al.,2022](#r37)) is where only 2 labels are given, for instance true/false,
    yes/no etcetera. Most basic algorithm for binary classification is logistic regression
    ([Peng et al., 2002](#r80)) that uses the logit function for separating the 2
    distinct classes from each other. Considering the CPS, this can be used when there
    is need to turn on/off something based on some set of parameters. For classes
    more than 2 there are many other set of algorithms. These models are available
    in parametric and non-parametric methods where decision tree (Quinlan J.R, 1986),
    random forest (Breiman L,2001; [Kanvinde et al.,2022](#r54)), support vector machines
    ([Hearst et al., 1998](#r44)) and k-nearest neighbors (Cunningham et al., 2021)
    fall under non-parametric learning methods that are commonly used. Considering
    parametric learning methods, logistic regression for binary and discriminant analysis
    ([Huberty,1975](#r48); [Gupta et al.,2022](#r37); [Ramayah et al.,2010](#r85))
    is an example of parametric multi-class learning algorithm. Random Forest falls
    under non-parametric ensemble learning method. Ensemble learning is a process
    of learning where a set of weak learners are combined to form a strong learner.
    These are much more generalized in nature as compared to the basic learners. The
    ensemble learning is divided into bagging (Breiman L, 1996) and boosting ([Gupta
    et al.,2021](#r40), Opitz et al.1999) style algorithms. Bagging is also known
    as bootstrap aggregation and random forest is its type, boosting is another ensemble
    learning that works on improving the performance of the weak learners on every
    step. The types of boosting ensemble learning methods are AdaBoost (Freund et
    al.,1999; [Schapire,1999](#r96)), Gradient Boosting (Natekin et al., 2013), XGBoost
    (Chen T. et al., 2016) and CatBoost ([Prokhorenkova et al., 2018](#r82)). More
    generalized learners can be found with stacked generalization (Wolpret, 1992)
    method that provides learning procedure by combining various learners stacked
    with each other for best possible results. The data if allocated in a bigger amount
    can then be used with Deep Learning ([Goodfellow et al., 2016](#r35); LeCun,2015).
    It is an extended branch of machine learning that works with non-parametric system.
    The parameters learned about the prediction flow is very different from traditional
    learning algorithms and gives effective predictions even on very massive dataset.
    The deep learning system uses artificial neural network inspired by biological
    neurons in humans. These networks are very vast and learns the parameters using
    activation layers and hidden neurons. Even single neuron is declared arbitrarily
    and is assigned a certain weight and bias that is modulated with data using the
    activation function. These activation functions are mathematical functions used
    for smoothening the information gained by the network. Rectified Linear Unit ([Agarap,
    2018](#r1)) and Tangent Hyperbolic ([De Ryck et al., 2021](#r25)) are some types
    of commonly used activation functions. These layers arranged in certain proportion
    learn the patterns from data sequentially in the forward propagation. Later this
    data is validated and loss of information is computed with loss functions. Binary
    cross-entropy and categorical cross-entropy are type of some loss functions. The
    loss is then optimized till the start of network using loss optimizers. These
    loss optimizers calculate the gradient of the weights, biases and learnt features
    to reduce the loss as much as possible. This entire process is known as backward
    propagation ([LeCun et al., 1998](#r64)). Adam ([Gupta et al.,2022](#r37), Kingma
    et al.,2014), AdaGrad (Duchi J et al., 2011) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (Ruder
    S,2016) are some common types of loss optimizers.

- en: The forward and backward propagation together constitute one learning epoch
    and there can be many epochs in a network. This procedure is not only confined
    to the numerical data. The sensors are getting smarter and data collection procedures
    are also improving. The data collected can be image, videos, text and audio. The
    image and videos fall under the computer vision problems that can be solved using
    deep learning. The classification performed in computer vision using deep learning
    is done using a specific type of neural network known as convolutional neural
    network suggested by ([Albawi et al.,2017](#r5); LeCun et al.; Musale et al.,2021;
    [Yamashita et al.,2018](#r108)) in which they had that used set of filters also
    known as kernels for extracting features from image. These filters perform various
    image processing methods to extract information from the images including the
    error level analysis (Gupta, A et al.,2022) The data can be used for transfer
    learning with some popular convolutional neural networks trained on Image-Net
    (Russakovsky, O et al.,2015) dataset, which is a dataset of over 1000 classes.
    Some commonly used convolutional neural networks are AlexN (Russakovsky, O et
    al.,2015), VGG-16 (Simonyan, K et al.,2014), ResNet (Gupta A et al.,2022; [He
    K. et al.,2016](#r43)), Inception Net (Szegedy, C et al.,2015). These are very
    parameter rich and can be used to advantage if the data collected from sensors
    is in form of images. If the data is pertaining to the detection of certain objects,
    object detection algorithms like Yolo used by (Bochkovskiy, A et al.,2020; Redmon,
    J et al. 2016), R-CNN (Girshick, R et al.,2015), Fast RCNN (Girshick, R et al.,2015),
    Faster RCNN (Ren, S et al.,2015) can be used. If data should be used to highlight
    the certain portion from the data, image segmentation can be used with algorithms
    like U-Net(Ronneberger, O et al.,2015), Bottleneck Supervised Network(Li, S et
    al.,2018) and Yolact(Bolya, D et al.,2019;Bolya D et al.,2020, Joshi, R.M et al.,2022).
    If the data is in text format, this falls under the natural language processing
    category. The system of NLP with machine learning uses basic text management for
    learning word representations using bag of words (Zhang, Y et al.,2010) and TF-IDF
    (Tambe, S et al.,2022). If deep leaning needs to be used, one can work with Recurrent
    Neural Network(Cho, K et al.,2014). This can run into vanishing gradient problem
    in backward propagation for which LSTM(Joshi R et al.,2022; Staudemeyer R, et
    al.,2019) can be used. Learning procedure to improve the working with LSTM, Bidirectional
    LSTM(Cui, Z et al.,2018) is used that takes the input of the sequence from future
    that helps discard the information that is not useful. Modern systems for speed
    in learning and training with better accuracy have considered working with transformer
    ([Vaswani A. et al.,2017](#r105); [Joshi R. et al.,2022](#r53)) architectures
    that take the input of entire sequence and work with encoders and decoders. The
    machine translation was one of the primary tasks that were considered. Later tasks
    like Named Entity Recognition ( [Li, J., Sun et al.,2020](#r65)) were given importance.
    The most common set of transformer is BERT (Devlin, J et al.,2018) which literally
    means bidirectional encoder representations from transformer. Many more advancements
    were brought after BERT and still very high end research is under process. Considering
    audio input the neural network like WaveNet(Oord, A.v.d et al.,2016) can be used
    to understand the audio and make audio translations.

- en: The data in the distributed manner when is monitored by a centralized system
    has many loopholes. It is specifically controlled by one single-body and monitoring
    of the system has a moderator. This compromises security on different dimensions
    of operation. This was practically a need for a decentralized solution, one which
    has no moderator and is not adjourned by any entity whatsoever. This ensures a
    very secure operation and provides transparency as tampering with the data is
    practically impossible. This is where the discovery of Blockchain([Nakamoto, 2009](#r75);
    Vujicic,et.al.,2018) proved to be ultimate solution. The blockchain is an extremely
    compact and secure database system that ensures many aspects of security as its
    top priority. The key-point that should be taken into consideration is, it is
    distributed yet provides a very top tier security. The most considerable point
    of the blockchain was its decentralized nature. From a very top view it looks
    and operates like a typical database but inside operation is far more different.
    The structuring of the data is different as it stores the information in blocks
    as its name implies. Then a chain of these blocks is made that is linked with
    the previous block. This is redundant and changing one block is impossible. A
    change to one block requires all the blocks to grant access, which also is adjourned
    by the rules of a smart contract. So practically this makes it heavily decentralized
    in working and impossible to break. The chain is tightly linked and requires to
    reflect change in all the blocks which is great for any application that is for
    preserving the integrity and avoiding tampering of the data.

    changes. This application heavily influenced the cryptocurrency(Farell, R,2015;
    Jose, K.A,2018) area as the real time of the transaction was necessary. This uses
    transparency and real time changes for security reasons (Hiran, K et al). Bitcoin
    is a very famous cryptocurrency that is traded on daily basis and operates on
    blockchain. The currency is peer to peer and required all the properties listed
    by the blockchain. The records stored in traditional databases are with typical
    non-redundant process, where as blockchain does with blocks and the data stored
    is known as ledger. The concept of decentralization is implemented in blockchain,
    making the ledgers decentralized and calling the process as decentralized ledger
    transfer for any transaction process. The benefit of the blockchain application
    was massive cost reduction that eliminates the need of third party verification.

    pertaining to quantum blockchain, but first understanding the quantum computer
    as a bigger picture is necessary. The term was coined in 1981 itself when creating
    exponentially growing simulations in physics were the need. This problem persisted
    without a definite solution until the area of quantum mechanics (Bhatt et al,2019;
    [Ladd et al,2010](#r60); [Jazaeri et al,2019](#r50)) was discovered. The NP problems
    in computer science are no different from complex problems in physics or chemistry
    which grow exponentially.

- en: Traditional solution was paralleling the pipelines in which process of the data
    takes place, which does work but many problems are left hanging as parallelization
    solves the problem in linear time and fails to cover for exponentially growing
    time. The expression to work with quantum computers can be given through quantum
    mechanics itself as it using quantum bits instead of normal bits. The context
    of superposition (Li, T., Yin et al.,2016) is the most important concept in quantum
    mechanics as it gives the intuition of how things work. It has a very different
    understanding as it states the world operates in a simulation and the possibility
    of the two events happening are evident but the event happens where the native
    experiences the dynamics of it happening. This is a very deep explanation and
    can be broken down in very subtle explanation as measurements collapse the superposition
    to observed state of the native. This is the root idea of the quantum mechanics.
    The quantum computing holds all the possible dynamics from the quantum mechanics
    and it is not a replacement for the traditional computers available currently
    as all the operations taking place on it are working in different system. Some
    research gives an estimation that problems from Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time
    can be brought to polynomial time using the quantum computing, although it is
    just an estimation. For understanding the mathematical intuition of the quantum
    computing, one needs to focus on superposition intuition from quantum mechanics
    as it directly is associated with qubits (quantum bits) which are the bits of
    the quantum computers. The basic intuition can be developed with the spinning
    particle in the state of superposition using dirac notation, which is an equation
    of linear dimension of particle imposing position in upward and downward direction.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This term is specifically coined for the advent threat to the blockchain systems
    using quantum computing technologies. The strongest point of a blockchain is its
    security which is very strong and almost unbreakable. The amount of the entire
    chain that needs to be broken needs the person to acquire atleast 51% of the entire
    chain. This is currently impossible with the state-of-the-art systems, but can
    be done with quantum computing in the near future. The only reason of the quantum
    computers able to calculate different bits in parallel fashion, the superposition
    is an important concept. The entanglement is the prime factor that can break the
    blockchain in upcoming years. In quantum mechanics it is linked with the perfect
    entanglement of the particle interaction with each other. The changes in one particle
    affect the other particles in same dimension space. So considering the superposition
    and entanglement, the tasks will be performed in a sequential manner and parallelization
    will merely become a complex problem in high performance computing. Superposition
    uses qubits which exponentially grow, as 2-qubits result in 4 different outcomes
    taking place simultaneously whereas 4 qubits will work with 16 different outcomes
    and so on. Current state-of-the-art qubits are less likely to break a blockchain.
    The blockchain is a distributed decentralized ledger and is tightly coupled protected
    by cryptography algorithms. A powerful system with high number of qubits can perform
    alteration before the data goes into the ledger. This task will be seamlessly
    become possible with the quantum computers. Since the data performs hashing before
    being added to the ledger and one tampered document will create an infraction
    in the integrity, the alteration will be done before the write operation. If one-way
    mathematical functions are used the alteration can be performed. Every blockchain
    intended for certain operation has a smart contract. This has digital signatures.
    These can be broken using one-way mathematical functions. One example of it is
    a trapdoor function. This is used to compute the solution in a reverse manner.
    Basically there is a single way in which the operation will take place and if
    a reverse solution is used the deliberated information is leaked. It does require
    additional information though, so in the case of blockchain this will be a difficult
    task. The trapdoor functions have been there since the ages of asymmetric and
    public-key encryption techniques were discovered. The RSA (Rivest, R.L et al.,1978)
    and Rabin (Yaqin, A et al.,2019) were cryptographical functions that did survive
    the trapdoor function. Considering the prime factorization involved where there
    exponential modulo of the composite number, the trapdoor functions faced limitations.
    This is where quantum computers can break that chain as it works efficiently with
    the exponential functions. Another one-way mathematical function is one-way hash
    function. One-way hash function is a compression mathematical function that takes
    variable length of input and hashes it into fixed length binary sequence. It is
    very difficult to compute the inverse function with a traditional computer, but
    this task will be not daunting for a quantum computer. Quantum computing the reverse
    calculations will become very commonplace. Manipulation in the transaction history
    will become very easy. Changing the hash of blockchain is not possible because
    it spoils the chain and it will inform the entire peer-to-peer network. That is
    the reason the breakage can be caused without spoiling the hash. The record needs
    to be changed, then the result is supposed to be encrypted and hash should be
    checked if it is same as earlier otherwise entire system is failed. Calculating
    a private key from a public key will be also possible using the quantum computer.
    RSA is one of the algorithms that work with public and private key systems. The
    RSA can be cracked using the Shor’s ([Shor P.W., 1999](#r98)) Algorithm. For breaking
    a public key, 2 prime number combinations are required. Quantum computers factor
    very large numbers in fraction of seconds. So breaking modern day RSA will not
    be a daunting task for quantum computers in upcoming years. If we currently consider
    the time complexity of the prime factorization given in equation below

- en: The quantum resistant blockchain remains essential after understanding the threats
    of the quantum computers for blockchain as they can tamper the information before
    writing the record on blocks without breaking the hash. Before understanding the
    resistant system of it, the problems could be understood in more depth. Many advance
    problems can be focused. Hashcash proof-of-work was represented for Bitcoin (Aggarwal,
    D et al.,2017) where using a Grover search algorithm(Grover, L K et al.,1996),
    the quantum computers can easily perform fewer hashes in quadratic time that beats
    the traditional computer. The gate speeds can range upto 100 Ghz allowing quantum
    computers to solve the problem about 100 times faster. The private key derived
    from the public key will be main issue of concern. Traditional modern day computers
    are inefficient for performing that, but this task won’t be daunting for quantum
    computers. The entanglement and superposition will be used for cracking the cryptography.
    The system will use (Roetteler, M et al.,2017) quantum resource estimation for
    computing the discrete logarithms for elliptic curve. Majority of blockchain uses
    the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECSDA) ([Al-Zubaidie et al., 2019](#r4);
    [Bi W. et al.,2018](#r13); Sonnino et al.,2016) for cryptographical hashes. Considering
    quantum computer, Shor’s algorithm can be used to break Elliptic Curve Digital
    Signature Algorithm (Proos, J et al.,2003) where private key can be derived from
    public key that can create a transaction for handling wallet. Since ECSDA can
    be broken, RSA (Rivest, R.L et al.,1978) is not a challenge. Quantum factoring
    with shor’s algorithm was demonstrated over silicon photonic chip (Politi, A et
    al.,2009) that gave a small insight on the breakdown of experiment.

    et al.,2018](#r8)) which is more stable and error-less than traditional shor’s
    algorithm. The algorithm is still under development but will work efficiently
    with Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) (Bharti, K et al.,2022) computers.
    The concept of post-quantum cryptography ([Bavdekar, et al.,2022](#r9); Jain R
    et al.) can make some changes and this will definitely become the basis for quantum
    resistant blockchain. Bringing the change in schemes of signature will be the
    primary task of quantum resistant blockchain which won’t be a easy task for sure.
    This will be bringing change in every single cryptocurrency wallet. The need for
    consensus will be next challenge where it is supposed to be implemented through
    a fork. Reaching the apex with consensus for a decentralized system like blockchain
    is not an easy task certainly. It is like scaling the entire bitcoin in a longer
    run. The most important task among all will be post-quantum cryptography as it
    is like writing an entire scheme of security-based algorithms. Considering the
    stateful signatures using the XMSS (Buchmann, J et al.,2011) is first aspect.
    For making it user friendly the use of WOTS+ (Hu¨lsing, A et al.,2017) is an aspect.
    Handling the 41kB signatures using the SPHINCS (Bernstein et al., 2014) is one
    more aspect. Handling the side channel attacks using BLISS ([Espitau et al.,2017](#r29))
    is one more aspect. IOTA signatures are very common solution for shifting at the
    moment. The quantum resistant ledger (Stewart, I et al.,2018) uses XMSS and better
    functioning. The safe solution for transferring of the funds is by committing
    to quantum resistance suggested by Stewart, which can be termed as defense for
    bitcoin against a fast quantum computing attack. This is a quantum resistant signature
    scheme that has been implemented. The hash of the public key and quantum resistant
    public key is made. This creates a strong system as tampering of private key through
    the public key is avoided as there is quantum resistant public key. The quantum
    capable adversaries will be a challenge in upcoming period for which delay phase
    will work much more effectively. Not reusing any addresses is terminology that
    makes the Bitcoin quantum resistant. An eclipse attack (Heilman, E et al.,2015)
    is a network level attack performed on peer to-peer systems. This can cut slack
    for extra time required to work with the public keys for making the respective
    private keys. The simple solution for this is using First In First Out (FIFO)
    system because it will ensure the transactions are in order as they come and forged
    transactions can be avoided. Since the transactions are taking place, the man-in-the-middle
    attack is very common but fortunately RSA and ECDSA can be used which cannot be
    broken. The attack if smartly handled applied before the original transaction
    reaches the network can cause damage. Speaking of multicast, it is also not much
    effective. The signature schemes once designed will secure blockchain from quantum-based
    attacks and quantum resistant blockchain will be able to avoid them to certain
    extent.
