    Cryptocurrency, and it has definitely peaked your interest. You're probably thinking
    you'd like to get in the profits that are beckoning you but don't know where to
    start. Well, you've come to the right place.

    economic system. That's a pretty bold statement considering that the system we
    are using now has been in place for hundreds of years. However, if you've learned
    anything about economic history, no matter where you came from, whose culture
    you adopt, or your status in life, the economic and political fabric of the world
    is never completely set. It is always in a state of flux, and when the systems
    in place no longer meet the needs of the public, they must change. We are on the
    precipice of change right now with cryptocurrency.

    find that only half of them have ever heard of it, likely half of them have no
    idea what it is, and the odds are that half of those who do know what it is, have
    any detailed knowledge. And likely only a small percentage of them actually have
    earned or invested any money in it.

    evolution? The answer is simple. While the percentage of people with knowledge
    of it is still small, the news of this amazing innovative opportunity in economic
    evolution is spreading. It's spreading because cryptocurrency has already proven
    to be the perfect solution for many who are already struggling in this harsh and
    slanted economic environment. The opportunities are endless, and all it takes
    is a little know-how, and you can start building your new financial portfolio
    with cryptocurrency and turn a tidy profit in the process.

- en: Every society since mankind began trading things of value had some type of currency.
    Notice I used the word currency, not money. The reason for this is because money
    is merely one form of currency; it is used to transfer VALUE from one party to
    the next. Now that we are in the digital age, cryptocurrency is simply currency
    in digital form.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, people used all sorts of things to transfer value from one person
    to the next. At one point, they were using livestock (cattle, goats, sheep, pigs,
    chickens, etc.). Later, when carrying around a few cows every time you needed
    to go shopping turned out to be cumbersome, they began trading shells (conch,
    puka, conch, etc.) or beads, after that it was bone, metal, and now paper (actually
    paper money is not really paper at all, it’s a secret blend of bamboo and cotton
    fibers, woven together with silk threads).

    around physical money is not as important or necessary as it once was. People
    now do much of their buying and selling either online or with credit or debit
    cards. Eventually, physical money may completely fade from use. What’s now taking
    its place is cryptocurrency, the next step up in a digital form of currency that
    is traded and managed entirely online.

- en: The word cryptocurrency itself is a blend of two Greek words, "crypto," which
    means "to be hidden or to be kept private." In English, we use these as root words
    quite often. A crypt is a place where you can hide dead bodies, cryptic – to have
    a mysterious or hidden meaning, cryptography – the study of breaking codes to
    find their hidden meaning or the practice of solving them. This is the general
    idea behind cryptocurrency, the art of writing code (encrypt) or decoding (decrypt).
    The second word in the blend "currency" refers to the object used to transfer
    value from one party to the next. Today, that object is money, but in the modern
    world of cryptocurrency, it is digital code.

    value. This is done by creating complex mathematical formulas and unique protocols
    designed to make the codes virtually impossible to break, counterfeit, or duplicate.
    These protocols then not only protect the transaction between two parties but
    they also conceal the identity of all those involved.

- en: The beauty of cryptocurrency is that it is not under the control of any governmental
    agency, so there is no centralized institution or political entity responsible
    for determining its value. The value, therefore, is determined primarily by its
    users and is based on supply and demand. This causes the price to fluctuate more
    like that of stocks and bonds.

    save it, trade it, or even invest it in the same manner. The difference is that
    you would never hold them in your hands; they only exist as lines of code maintained
    in a database, and just like with physical currency, you cannot change its value.
    If you have $20 bill in your hand, there is no way you can change that to $100
    or any other value. It is what it is. However, you can always add to it, subtract
    from it, or save it anytime you like.

- en: Cryptocurrency, like all other innovations, was created to solve a particular
    problem. In the beginning, it was never meant to become the preferred currency
    of trade but was to be used as a side product to complement an already existing
    digital currency system.

- en: You probably had no idea that each time you used your debit card, credit card,
    or had an automatic deposit sent to your bank account, you were using digital
    currency. Each time you paid your bills online, you were using digital currency.
    While these tools certainly made life simpler, they presented a major problem,
    that of double spending. Double spending simply meant that the same money could
    be spent twice, simply because it could easily be copied. There was always a risk
    that the possessor could replicate the currency and send it to another party and
    still hold on to the original.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, with the introduction of cryptocurrency, for the first time, people
    could use digital currency without going through a centralized server, without
    any specialized regulation, or a single authority overseeing everything. The system
    was based entirely on P2P (person to person) networks used as an assurance against
    double spending.

- en: While it may not have been the original intent of this new monetary instrument,
    another issue that cryptocurrency resolved was creating a system that eliminated
    the need for a third-party to be involved in transactions. This automatically
    provided a more secure system for making online payments. It also eliminated the
    cost of having to pay exorbitant fees for every transaction made. The new digital
    currency was designed to be completely independent of any type of central regulation
    or third-party involvement.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually, the original intent for cryptocurrency was as a wealth enrichment
    tool. As there is a cap on the amount of cryptocurrency available on the market,
    the more people use it, the higher the demand. Therefore, over time, the value
    of the currency will gradually increase.

    and no any other third parties. No transaction takes place unless there is an
    absolute consensus and no funds can be transferred unless it is legitimate.

    the most well-known among them is the Bitcoin, but we’ll talk more about that
