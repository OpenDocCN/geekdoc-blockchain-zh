    of bitcoin. (As an analogy, think of this like Android scripting languages, which
    make it easier for developers to create Android apps.) He was young and inexperienced,
    so his idea didn’t get much traction among bitcoin’s core developers, who were
    now the “old guard.” So Vitalik built the project himself.
