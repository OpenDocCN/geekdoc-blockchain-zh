- en: The aim of this work is to investigate emerging research trends and propose
    an evidence-based roadmap for encouraging further research into the management
    of blockchain technology. A bibliometric analysis is proposed, with a focus on
    intellectual property (IP) issues, in the field of blockchain technology. Then,
    the study highlights the main benefits that blockchain provides as well as the
    main difficulties, barriers, and challenges that emerge from the literature. The
    present study provides a reference for scientific communities to understand the
    current state of blockchain technology, thereby contributing to future research
    in the area. Moreover, it offers industrial implications and recommendations for
    entrepreneurs, managers, and practitioners.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past few years, blockchain technology has been receiving considerable
    attention from academics, industry practitioners, and governments. Blockchain
    technology, particularly the digital payment system Bitcoin, first attracted the
    public’s attention in 2008\. It started to be applied in different fields and
    to stimulate digital innovation. The main advantage of blockchain technology is
    its ability to verify a multitude of attributes simultaneously (e.g., identity,
    author/creatorship, property, time, or order). It allows the distribution of correct
    information across networks by preventing its manipulation. Information can be
    kept safe and untouched by unauthorised third parties; this is particularly relevant
    in company and industrial contexts.

    technology (Yu & Pan, 2021), but few are focused on the patent production and
    on the main possible future trends. Thus, the present study uses bibliometric
    analysis in order to investigate emerging research trends of intellectual property
    activity on blockchain. The study is organised as follows. The first section focuses
    on the literature related to blockchain technology. This is followed by a bibliometric
    analysis section on the main scientific studies that focus on intellectual property
    (IP) issues, in the field of blockchain technology. Then, the study highlights
    the main benefits that blockchain provides as well as the main difficulties, barriers,
    and challenges that emerge from the literature review of each cluster. Implications,
    recommendations and further research are reported in the final section.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Both academics and industry practitioners have paid attention to the wide range
    of blockchain applications, but the development of the associated technology has
    not been thoroughly studied. Some reviews have examined the specific role of blockchain
    in different sectors: the Internet of Things (IoT; Conoscenti et al., 2016, Christidis
    & Devetsikiotis, 2016); big data (Karafiloski and Mishev, 2017a); security (Khan
    & Salah, 2017; Li et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2018); service systems (Seebacher
    et al., 2017); and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms (Hawlitschek et al., 2018). Other
    studies (Bonneau et al., 2015; Tsukerman, 2015; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016; Khalilov
    & Levi, 2018; Conti et al., 2018) were focused on privacy. Yli-Huumo et al. (2016)
    analysed 41 blockchain papers on technology and concluded that there were at that
    point no reasonable solutions to challenges such as latency and hard forks. Hölbl
    et al. (2018) examined 33 studies in health care and stated that current research
    on blockchain applications in the field was still at the framework design stage.
    Firdaus et al. (2019) carried out a statistical analysis of 1,119 papers and found
    that the United States, China, and Germany were the countries with the most published
    papers on blockchain technologies and that the IoT and medical care were the most
    popular areas for researchers. Dabbagh, Sookhak, and Safa’s (2019) review several
    papers revealing that computers, engineering, economics, and telecommunications
    were the main blockchain research areas. Casino et al. (2019) undertook a structured,
    systematic review and thematic content analysis of the literature and presented
    a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications across diverse
    sectors such as supply chains, business, healthcare, IoT, privacy, and data management.
    Meanwhile, Hu and Pan (2021) identified the paths of blockchain technology through
    the examination of relevant patents. However, these have been under-researched.
    A large amount of investment is flowing into the blockchain space to support inventions
    and new blockchain’s applications in precision medicine, financial transactions,
    energy waste reduction, digital rights management, and so on. Companies have an
    interest in staking a claim to their inventions by filing patent applications.
    This area could become a “land grab” for intellectual property in the next future.
    Thus, the present study attempts to understand which are the main trends in blockchain
    literature that concentrates on patent activities? Which are the main practices
    in the field? Which are the main benefits and the future possible challenges?
    Through an analysis of 286 papers, it is possible to get an overall picture of
    the development of blockchain from a technological perspective. Then, a focus
    on the specific management field is proposed, by selecting 57 papers. The present
    study provides a reference for scientific communities to understand the current
    state of blockchain technology, thereby contributing to future research in the
    area.'

    et al., 2019; McMillan, 2008; Skute et al., 2019); entrepreneurship (Albort-Morant
    & Ribeiro-Soriano, 2016; Ferreira, 2018; Gartner et al., 2006; Lampe et al., 2019;
    Verma & Gustafsson, 2020); social sciences (Ho, 2014); and medical sciences (Cheng
    & Zhang, 2013) have recognised the importance of bibliometric analysis. This is
    a tool that complements systematic literature reviews. It supports systematic
    analysis through objective techniques and allows us to identify influential authors
    and reveal their interrelationships (Ferreira, 2018). This approach is based on
    the statistical analysis of scientific documents and relative citations. This
    can be used to identify the degree of expansion in specific research fields.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two different methods of citation analysis are used to identify publications
    in particular areas. The first method is bibliographic coupling analysis, which
    is used when two documents refer to a third common document in their bibliographic
    graphs, indicating the probability that these documents are linked through the
    topic(s) being discussed. The “coupling strength” of two given documents is determined
    by the number of citations they share with other documents (Ferreira, 2018; Kessler,
    1963; Martyn, 1964). The second method is co-citation analysis, which is employed
    when two documents are cited independently in one or more documents (Small, 1973).
    In a database where links are restricted, bibliographic coupling analysis clusters
    the latest documents and only a limited number of very old papers, while co-citation
    analysis clusters the oldest documents and not newer documents that have yet to
    be cited. The present study employs coupling analysis.

    intellectual property (IP) issues in the field of blockchain technology. An ad
    hoc protocol was developed to perform bibliometric analysis (Ferriera, 2018).
    The selection of the relevant articles involved three stages. First, a specific
    type of query was chosen. The search strategy was based on a structured query
    and implemented using an extensive citation database. Second, the Elsevier Scopus
    database was chosen because: (a) it is one of the largest citation databases in
    the world; (b) it has indexed around 70 million documents (the greatest number
    of any database) from 1788; and (c) it covers subject areas ranging from biological
    sciences to management and social sciences (Cavallone & Palumbo, 2020). Moreover,
    it includes data on academic publications, including affiliations and citations.
    Finally, the following query was adapted to the certain attributes of the search
    engines for each database. It was as follows: (TITLE-ABS-KEY (blockchain* AND
    patent*) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (block AND chain* AND patent*) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (intellectual
    AND property AND blockchain*) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (intellectual AND property AND
    block AND chain*). The search was conducted in May 2021 and returned 286 papers.
    In the following section, the authors describe the papers in more detail. The
    first was published in 1961, but most were published in 2016 (Figure 1).'

    a map based on a three-phase recurrence matrix: (a) a “similarity matrix” applying
    a mapping method (Waltman et al., 2010) using the strength of the association;
    (b) a map that reflects the extent of similarity between objects (Van Eck et al.,

    coupling techniques can be used to identify hot research topics and can be an
    aid to future research directions (Glänzel & Czerwon, 1996). The minimum number
    of citations of a document was selected as two. Of 286 documents, 119 documents
    met the threshold. For each of these, the total strength of the bibliographic
    coupling links with other documents was calculated. The authors omitted the papers
    that had a total link strength of zero, which then left only 54 items.

    simplifying transactions at all levels and straight connecting energy producers,
    suppliers and distribution systems to consumers. It mainly can concentrate on
    building platforms for energy exchange and creating distributed energy systems.
    Through blockchain and smart contracts, energy networks can also be effectively

    to blockchain technology (Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created in 2008, has a blockchain
    system). There are also other applications (,) such recording and validating the
    ownership of digital currency or to execute, validate and record payments made
    with digital currency, but also with reference to credit securities, derivatives
    and other financial instruments, credit registers, transactions for the payment
    of traditional goods and others. Some of these are already a reality, while others
    are technologically feasible, but encounter legislative and bureaucratic problems

    the preferences are directly executed, and it provides the impossibility of manipulation
    of the results. It is possible to think about a paradigm shift from traditional
    voting methods (centralized) to electronic ones (decentralized) based on trust,
    transparency and confidentiality with the security of breaking down the possible
    tampering (Maesa & Mori, 2020; Taş & Tanrıöver, 2020).

    Four clusters emerged from the bibliometric analysis. The first refers to the
    adaptability of blockchain technology to various aspects of social and working
    life. The second cluster refers to the applications and strategic adoptions of
    blockchain. The third cluster highlights the emerging business model while the
    fourth focuses on two main blockchain’s characteristics: security and traceability.
    Blockchain applications are possible both in the public and private sectors. To
    address social impact and governance challenges, innovators must consider potential
    synergies between blockchain and other emerging technologies (such as artificial
    intelligence, internet of things, quantum computing, etc). Moreover, there is
    the need of specific laws and regulations.'
