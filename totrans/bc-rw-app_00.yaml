- en: The “Tragedy of the Commons” is a long-held belief that people cannot serve
    their personal interest and the common good simultaneously. Holding to this concept,
    millions of people worldwide continue to scavenge for basic necessities in the
    absence of formal identity, despite incomparable technical advancements.

- en: Identity is the nucleus of all human endeavors across the globe, including education,
    jobs, banking, finance, health care, business, e-commerce, national security,
    etc. Nevertheless, 1.1 billion people worldwide have no proof of identity, and
    45% of those without an identity are among the poorest 20% on the planet. This
    problem overly affects children and women in rural areas of Asia and Africa. Given
    this, the author came up with the current concept for an all-inclusive ID in 2016
    and originally called it “Generic Information Tracker” (*Dainik Bhaskar*, 2016).
    During the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial
    Research (CSIR) at Vijnana Bhawan, New Delhi, India, the author discussed his
    concept with Mr. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India. Mr. Modi praised
    the author’s work and encouraged him to develop the idea for India Vision, 2020.

    and privacy concerns of a single identity model against multiple identity documents.
    Following an analysis of the security concerns associated with a centralized database,
    a number of digital identity models were examined with respect to data security,
    decentralization, immutability, revocation, accountability, auditability, speed,
    and user control over personally identifiable information. Finally, blockchain
    seemed to be the most promising solution to readdress nearly all the issues affecting
    digital identity and access management.
