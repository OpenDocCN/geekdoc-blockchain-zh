    If you lack a competent approach to the calculation of the lot size, your account
    will be a non-starter regardless of your trading strategy. I hope that together
    we will puzzle out how to calculate your risks.

    the cryptocurrency market.

- en: 10% of the risk in one trade. That is, if you enter one trade, take no more
    than 10% of the risk. If you enter five trades a day, then, respectively, you
    should divide 10% of risk by 5\. Do not make frequent transactions, trying to
    earn more. You will lose a lot of money by paying commission fees to the exchange.

- en: 30% of cash  on the account is the minimum you should always have. You should
    never own only cryptocurrency or only fiat money. Even when the currency price
    falls, you should have some cryptocurrency assets. Respectively, when the market
    grows, you should have fewer assets in Bitcoin and more assets in Ether and altcoins.
    The larger capitalization of an asset, the less volatile it is. Thus, if you want
    to have smaller volatility in the fall, keep some of the money in Bitcoin. May
    it be 10-20% of all your funds, but you should not keep everything in cash. If
    you have Bitcoin, you can buy altcoins for it as they are often traded precisely
    for Bitcoin. At the same time, you should have at least 30% of cash, even when
    the market sees a super growth. You may need money for a new interesting ICO,
    a new movement with some kind of altcoin, etc.

- en: The reason for entry should be equal to the reason for exit. Whenever you enter
    a trade, you should know when you will exit. You should have an exit plan for
    any situation. All your plans should be clearly spelled out on paper, and you
    should not retreat from them.

- en: Diversification of marketplaces and assets. If you trade, you should do it on
    at least two top exchanges. Do not take risks even if the newly opened exchange
    seduces you with small fees or you are offered a bounty.

- en: Do not make many trades and avoid gambling. Here you need to understand how
    often you open the terminal and monitor the quotes. I recommend that you look
    at the cryptocurrency movements not more frequently than once a day. Choose the
    time of day when you feel comfortable to do this. For example, you come home from
    work, pour a glass of red wine (or a cup of tea), and calmly sit down to see what's
    new in the cryptocurrency market. You do not need to follow the market every ten
    minutes convulsively. Such nervous behavior will do good neither for your health
    nor for your wallet.

- en: Have your own opinion, and do not listen to the crowd. There is not a single
    person in the world who will tell you for sure how much Bitcoin will cost tomorrow
    or make other accurate forecasts. Therefore, if you hear very high-profile forecasts
    in favor of a particular coin, this person is probably biased in some way.

- en: I once again remind you that nothing can be 100% certain. I suggest you always
    being reasonably sceptical. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. Remember
    this and see through the trick. If someone convinces you of something, ask yourself
    why this man proves his point so fiercely. You can listen to the opinion of other
    people, but you cannot invest being guided by their opinion.

- en: Keep the stops in your head. As we said earlier, it makes no sense to use stop
    orders in the cryptocurrency market as they may not work or work badly. Therefore,
    always keep your stop (your exit point) in your head, or write it down in a notebook.
    For example, I bought the Ether for $250, and I will close the position at $200.

    the cryptocurrency market is very risky. But you will not make such profits anywhere
    else. You cannot double or triple a sum in a day anywhere else.

- en: Finally, I remind you that there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market.
    If a person gives you a guarantee, this person is a liar. Be ready for this as
    such situations are quite common in this market. The most cunning and bright-headed
    people (creators of ICOs, experienced traders, and so on) compete in the cryptocurrency
    market, and each of them pursues their own aims.
