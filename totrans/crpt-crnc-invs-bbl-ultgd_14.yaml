  zh: 第14章。风险与资金管理
- en: Money management is probably one of the most important concepts in investing.
    If you lack a competent approach to the calculation of the lot size, your account
    will be a non-starter regardless of your trading strategy. I hope that together
    we will puzzle out how to calculate your risks.

  zh: 资金管理可能是投资中最重要的概念之一。如果你缺乏对持仓规模的计算能力，无论你的交易策略是什么，你的账户都很难启动。我希望我们能一起解决如何计算你的风险。
- en: So now read carefully the main rules of money management which I define for
    the cryptocurrency market.

  zh: 现在仔细阅读我为加密货币市场定义的资金管理主要规则。
- en: 10% of the risk in one trade. That is, if you enter one trade, take no more
    than 10% of the risk. If you enter five trades a day, then, respectively, you
    should divide 10% of risk by 5\. Do not make frequent transactions, trying to
    earn more. You will lose a lot of money by paying commission fees to the exchange.

  zh: 单笔交易中10%的风险。也就是说，如果你进入一笔交易，不要承担超过10%的风险。如果你一天进入五笔交易，那么相应地，你应该将10%的风险分成五份。不要频繁交易，试图赚更多的钱。你会因为支付给交易所的手续费而损失很多钱。
- en: 30% of cash  on the account is the minimum you should always have. You should
    never own only cryptocurrency or only fiat money. Even when the currency price
    falls, you should have some cryptocurrency assets. Respectively, when the market
    grows, you should have fewer assets in Bitcoin and more assets in Ether and altcoins.
    The larger capitalization of an asset, the less volatile it is. Thus, if you want
    to have smaller volatility in the fall, keep some of the money in Bitcoin. May
    it be 10-20% of all your funds, but you should not keep everything in cash. If
    you have Bitcoin, you can buy altcoins for it as they are often traded precisely
    for Bitcoin. At the same time, you should have at least 30% of cash, even when
    the market sees a super growth. You may need money for a new interesting ICO,
    a new movement with some kind of altcoin, etc.

  zh: 账户上至少有30%的现金是最少的。你永远不应该只持有加密货币或只持有法定货币。即使货币价格下跌，你也应该拥有一些加密货币资产。相应地，当市场增长时，你手中的比特币资产应减少，以太坊和山寨币资产应增加。资产的市值越大，其波动性越小。因此，如果你想在下跌时拥有更小的波动性，应该保留一部分比特币资金。这部分资金可以是10-20%的全部资金，但你不能把所有资金都保留在现金中。如果你有比特币，可以用它来购买山寨币，因为它们通常是以比特币交易的。同时，你应该至少有30%的现金，即使市场经历超级增长。你可能需要资金用于一个新的有趣的ICO，一个新的带有某种山寨币的运动等。
- en: The reason for entry should be equal to the reason for exit. Whenever you enter
    a trade, you should know when you will exit. You should have an exit plan for
    any situation. All your plans should be clearly spelled out on paper, and you
    should not retreat from them.

  zh: 入场理由应与出场理由相等。无论何时进入交易，你应该知道何时退出。你应该为任何情况都制定一个退出计划。所有计划都应该在纸上清楚地写出来，并且不要轻易放弃它们。
- en: Diversification of marketplaces and assets. If you trade, you should do it on
    at least two top exchanges. Do not take risks even if the newly opened exchange
    seduces you with small fees or you are offered a bounty.

  zh: 市场和资产多元化。如果你交易，你应该至少在两个顶级交易所进行交易。即使新开放的交易所以低廉的费用诱惑你，或者给你提供赏金，也不要冒险。
- en: Do not make many trades and avoid gambling. Here you need to understand how
    often you open the terminal and monitor the quotes. I recommend that you look
    at the cryptocurrency movements not more frequently than once a day. Choose the
    time of day when you feel comfortable to do this. For example, you come home from
    work, pour a glass of red wine (or a cup of tea), and calmly sit down to see what's
    new in the cryptocurrency market. You do not need to follow the market every ten
    minutes convulsively. Such nervous behavior will do good neither for your health
    nor for your wallet.

  zh: 不要进行许多交易，避免赌博。这里你需要明白你打开终端并监控报价的频率。我建议你每天查看加密货币的走势不要超过一次。选择你感到舒适的时间。例如，你下班回家，倒一杯红酒（或一杯茶），平静地坐下，看看加密货币市场有什么新动向。你不需要紧张地每十分钟关注一次市场。这种紧张的行为对你的健康和钱包都没有好处。
- en: Have your own opinion, and do not listen to the crowd. There is not a single
    person in the world who will tell you for sure how much Bitcoin will cost tomorrow
    or make other accurate forecasts. Therefore, if you hear very high-profile forecasts
    in favor of a particular coin, this person is probably biased in some way.

  zh: 拥有自己的观点，不要随大流。世界上没有一个人能确切地告诉你比特币明天会值多少钱，或者做出其他准确的预测。因此，如果你听到某个高度预测某特定币种的观点，这个人可能有一定的偏见。
- en: I once again remind you that nothing can be 100% certain. I suggest you always
    being reasonably sceptical. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. Remember
    this and see through the trick. If someone convinces you of something, ask yourself
    why this man proves his point so fiercely. You can listen to the opinion of other
    people, but you cannot invest being guided by their opinion.

  zh: 我再次提醒你，没有什么是100%确定的。我建议你始终保持合理的怀疑态度。没有人知道未来会发生什么。记住这一点，看穿其中的花招。如果有人让你相信某件事，问问自己这个人为什么如此激烈地证明他的观点。你可以听取别人的意见，但不能盲目跟随他们的意见进行投资。
- en: Keep the stops in your head. As we said earlier, it makes no sense to use stop
    orders in the cryptocurrency market as they may not work or work badly. Therefore,
    always keep your stop (your exit point) in your head, or write it down in a notebook.
    For example, I bought the Ether for $250, and I will close the position at $200.

  zh: 在心中保持止损点。如我们之前所说，在加密货币市场中使用止损单是没有意义的，因为它们可能不起作用或者作用不佳。因此，始终保持你的止损点（你的退出点）在心中，或者将其写在笔记本上。例如，我以250美元购买了以太坊，我在200美元时会平仓。
- en: Risks. I am sure that you have clearly understood after reading this book that
    the cryptocurrency market is very risky. But you will not make such profits anywhere
    else. You cannot double or triple a sum in a day anywhere else.

  zh: 风险。我确信你在阅读完这本书后已经清楚地了解到加密货币市场是非常危险的。但你在其他地方无法获得这样的利润。你在其他地方无法在一天内将一笔钱翻倍或翻三倍。
- en: Finally, I remind you that there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market.
    If a person gives you a guarantee, this person is a liar. Be ready for this as
    such situations are quite common in this market. The most cunning and bright-headed
    people (creators of ICOs, experienced traders, and so on) compete in the cryptocurrency
    market, and each of them pursues their own aims.

  zh: 最后，我要提醒你，加密货币市场没有保证。如果一个人给你保证，那么这个人在说谎。为此做好准备，因为这种情况在这个市场中相当常见。最狡猾和聪明的人（ICO的创建者、经验丰富的交易员等）在加密货币市场中竞争，他们各自追求自己的目标。
