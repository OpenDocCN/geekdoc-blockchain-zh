- en: 'CHAPTER 1Disruptive MoneyThe financial innovation that is Bitcoin is still
    young. At the time of writing in 2020, Bitcoin is, for the most part, a niche
    product for specialized developers and speculators. Only a small portion of the
    world population owns crypto-assets, and even fewer understand how to hold and
    manage these assets. The prices follow hype cycles, driven by hope for the future
    and a rollercoaster of news, which makes it an environment of pioneers. The challenge
    is to deal with the confusion. Those who pierce the fog and see clearly, have
    a chance to seize opportunities as innovators.Startups have a chance to innovate
    when their team builds a product or service with the tools of an established blockchain,
    such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The benefit of either of these networks is their
    solid history, which enables your company to offer a reliable, uncensorable transfer
    of digital assets, becoming part of your competitive advantage when offering a
    new financial product or service. Smarter transactions for challenging situations
    are the future of money and finance because this is the latest industry to be
    disrupted by software. Software innovation took a long time to come to money because
    the intellectual challenge of inventing digital scarcity was hard to surmount.
    We can measure the size of that achievement by the political power required to
    create scarcity in ordinary paper currency: only an entity as large as a nation-state
    has the clout to keep a national currency secure. Furthermore, the technical work
    on cryptocurrency is a work in progress. As it is, functional national currencies
    have little to prove because the institutions of that currency are the standard
    for payments and investments. We need to build on top of the insights of Bitcoin
    to let the internet support money and finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first
    layer of private money, the first challenge to banks. We have to apply these insights
    to a growing set of value propositions. Blockchain products and services are not
    automatically better than those of banks. They merely have the potential to be
    so. The fight for innovation has only just started.We will use these definitions
    from public sources.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Bitcoin is a decentralized digital
    currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin
    uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction
    management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network. (…)
    Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted
    as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or
    socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography
    to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central
    authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable properties of a money-like good.
    They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult
    to counterfeit.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum is a global, open-source platform
    for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls
    digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.According
    to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public
    and distributed database of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the
    network. “Distributed” here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast
    to and recorded by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin
    and Ethereum work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but
    make different choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure
    and reliable alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized
    software applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security
    and flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Disruptive MoneyThe financial innovation that is Bitcoin is still young.
    At the time of writing in 2020, Bitcoin is, for the most part, a niche product
    for specialized developers and speculators. Only a small portion of the world
    population owns crypto-assets, and even fewer understand how to hold and manage
    these assets. The prices follow hype cycles, driven by hope for the future and
    a rollercoaster of news, which makes it an environment of pioneers. The challenge
    is to deal with the confusion. Those who pierce the fog and see clearly, have
    a chance to seize opportunities as innovators.Startups have a chance to innovate
    when their team builds a product or service with the tools of an established blockchain,
    such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The benefit of either of these networks is their
    solid history, which enables your company to offer a reliable, uncensorable transfer
    of digital assets, becoming part of your competitive advantage when offering a
    new financial product or service. Smarter transactions for challenging situations
    are the future of money and finance because this is the latest industry to be
    disrupted by software. Software innovation took a long time to come to money because
    the intellectual challenge of inventing digital scarcity was hard to surmount.
    We can measure the size of that achievement by the political power required to
    create scarcity in ordinary paper currency: only an entity as large as a nation-state
    has the clout to keep a national currency secure. Furthermore, the technical work
    on cryptocurrency is a work in progress. As it is, functional national currencies
    have little to prove because the institutions of that currency are the standard
    for payments and investments. We need to build on top of the insights of Bitcoin
    to let the internet support money and finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first
    layer of private money, the first challenge to banks. We have to apply these insights
    to a growing set of value propositions. Blockchain products and services are not
    automatically better than those of banks. They merely have the potential to be
    so. The fight for innovation has only just started.We will use these definitions
    from public sources.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Bitcoin is a decentralized digital
    currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin
    uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction
    management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network. (…)
    Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted
    as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or
    socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography
    to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central
    authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable properties of a money-like good.
    They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult
    to counterfeit.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum is a global, open-source platform
    for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls
    digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.According
    to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public
    and distributed database of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the
    network. “Distributed” here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast
    to and recorded by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin
    and Ethereum work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but
    make different choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure
    and reliable alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized
    software applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security
    and flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.The financial innovation that is Bitcoin is still young. At the time
    of writing in 2020, Bitcoin is, for the most part, a niche product for specialized
    developers and speculators. Only a small portion of the world population owns
    crypto-assets, and even fewer understand how to hold and manage these assets.
    The prices follow hype cycles, driven by hope for the future and a rollercoaster
    of news, which makes it an environment of pioneers. The challenge is to deal with
    the confusion. Those who pierce the fog and see clearly, have a chance to seize
    opportunities as innovators.Startups have a chance to innovate when their team
    builds a product or service with the tools of an established blockchain, such
    as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The benefit of either of these networks is their solid
    history, which enables your company to offer a reliable, uncensorable transfer
    of digital assets, becoming part of your competitive advantage when offering a
    new financial product or service. Smarter transactions for challenging situations
    are the future of money and finance because this is the latest industry to be
    disrupted by software. Software innovation took a long time to come to money because
    the intellectual challenge of inventing digital scarcity was hard to surmount.
    We can measure the size of that achievement by the political power required to
    create scarcity in ordinary paper currency: only an entity as large as a nation-state
    has the clout to keep a national currency secure. Furthermore, the technical work
    on cryptocurrency is a work in progress. As it is, functional national currencies
    have little to prove because the institutions of that currency are the standard
    for payments and investments. We need to build on top of the insights of Bitcoin
    to let the internet support money and finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first
    layer of private money, the first challenge to banks. We have to apply these insights
    to a growing set of value propositions. Blockchain products and services are not
    automatically better than those of banks. They merely have the potential to be
    so. The fight for innovation has only just started.We will use these definitions
    from public sources.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Bitcoin is a decentralized digital
    currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin
    uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction
    management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network. (…)
    Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted
    as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or
    socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography
    to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central
    authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable properties of a money-like good.
    They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult
    to counterfeit.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum is a global, open-source platform
    for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls
    digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.According
    to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public
    and distributed database of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the
    network. “Distributed” here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast
    to and recorded by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin
    and Ethereum work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but
    make different choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure
    and reliable alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized
    software applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security
    and flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Startups have a chance to innovate when their team builds a product or
    service with the tools of an established blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
    The benefit of either of these networks is their solid history, which enables
    your company to offer a reliable, uncensorable transfer of digital assets, becoming
    part of your competitive advantage when offering a new financial product or service.
    Smarter transactions for challenging situations are the future of money and finance
    because this is the latest industry to be disrupted by software. Software innovation
    took a long time to come to money because the intellectual challenge of inventing
    digital scarcity was hard to surmount. We can measure the size of that achievement
    by the political power required to create scarcity in ordinary paper currency:
    only an entity as large as a nation-state has the clout to keep a national currency
    secure. Furthermore, the technical work on cryptocurrency is a work in progress.
    As it is, functional national currencies have little to prove because the institutions
    of that currency are the standard for payments and investments. We need to build
    on top of the insights of Bitcoin to let the internet support money and finance.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum are the first layer of private money, the first challenge
    to banks. We have to apply these insights to a growing set of value propositions.
    Blockchain products and services are not automatically better than those of banks.
    They merely have the potential to be so. The fight for innovation has only just
    started.We will use these definitions from public sources.According to the Bitcoin
    wiki:Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments
    to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
    with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried
    out collectively by the network. (…) Building upon the notion that money is any
    object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and
    repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed
    around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of
    money, rather than relying on central authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable
    properties of a money-like good. They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable,
    fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum
    is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum,
    you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and
    is accessible anywhere in the world.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is
    a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed database of
    every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the network. “Distributed” here
    means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded by every
    node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum work
    on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but make different choices
    for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable alternative
    financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software applications,
    with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and flexibility
    are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance between them,
    consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to some extent Ethereum,
    solve the problem of centralized control over transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum
    empower their users by liberating them from any controlling or regulating third
    parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the transactions they
    enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding, without a
    third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.We will use these definitions from public sources.According to the Bitcoin
    wiki:Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments
    to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
    with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried
    out collectively by the network. (…) Building upon the notion that money is any
    object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and
    repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed
    around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of
    money, rather than relying on central authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable
    properties of a money-like good. They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable,
    fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum
    is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum,
    you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and
    is accessible anywhere in the world.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is
    a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed database of
    every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the network. “Distributed” here
    means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded by every
    node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum work
    on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but make different choices
    for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable alternative
    financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software applications,
    with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and flexibility
    are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance between them,
    consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to some extent Ethereum,
    solve the problem of centralized control over transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum
    empower their users by liberating them from any controlling or regulating third
    parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the transactions they
    enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding, without a
    third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency
    that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer
    technology to operate with no central authority: transaction management and money
    issuance are carried out collectively by the network. (…) Building upon the notion
    that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods
    and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context,
    Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation
    and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities. Bitcoins have
    all the desirable properties of a money-like good. They are portable, durable,
    divisible, recognizable, fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit.According
    to Ethereum.org:Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.
    On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed,
    and is accessible anywhere in the world.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain
    is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed database
    of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the network. “Distributed”
    here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded
    by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum
    work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but make different
    choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable
    alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software
    applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and
    flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments
    to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
    with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried
    out collectively by the network. (…) Building upon the notion that money is any
    object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and
    repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed
    around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of
    money, rather than relying on central authorities. Bitcoins have all the desirable
    properties of a money-like good. They are portable, durable, divisible, recognizable,
    fungible, scarce, and difficult to counterfeit.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum
    is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum,
    you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and
    is accessible anywhere in the world.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is
    a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed database of
    every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the network. “Distributed” here
    means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded by every
    node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum work
    on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but make different choices
    for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable alternative
    financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software applications,
    with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and flexibility
    are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance between them,
    consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to some extent Ethereum,
    solve the problem of centralized control over transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum
    empower their users by liberating them from any controlling or regulating third
    parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the transactions they
    enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding, without a
    third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.According to Ethereum.org:Ethereum is a global, open-source platform
    for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls
    digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.According
    to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public
    and distributed database of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the
    network. “Distributed” here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast
    to and recorded by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin
    and Ethereum work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but
    make different choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure
    and reliable alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized
    software applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security
    and flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.
    On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed,
    and is accessible anywhere in the world.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain
    is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed database
    of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the network. “Distributed”
    here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded
    by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum
    work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but make different
    choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable
    alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software
    applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and
    flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.According to the Bitcoin wiki:Blockchain is a cryptographically secured,
    time-stamped, public and distributed database of every (…) transaction that has
    ever occurred on the network. “Distributed” here means that the information in
    the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded by every node in the network. There
    is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum work on similar principles of
    decentralized transfer of value, but make different choices for their network.
    Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable alternative financial system,
    Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software applications, with a higher
    risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and flexibility are a fundamental
    tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance between them, consciously or not.Within
    the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to some extent Ethereum, solve the problem
    of centralized control over transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users
    by liberating them from any controlling or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies
    are a new asset class, then the transactions they enable are also of a new class:
    digital transfer and value-holding, without a third party. Users need a new breed
    of companies that make those transactions quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction,
    I described the essence of crypto entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product
    or service that makes the customer vulnerable to a third party : a person, company,
    or institution that controls the asset besides the parties that transact. Why
    is the third party a problem? To understand the original reasons for a third party,
    we have to go over a brief history of finance. We will look at the economic function
    of each player in financial transactions, to understand the possibilities offered
    by an established blockchain.Money as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before
    the industrial revolution, the money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level
    of society, money is a way to keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of
    who owes what to whom, and a way to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done
    by bankers: transmitting payments. One of the essential functions of banks is
    to move money from one place to the next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled
    the balance of trade between cities and countries by transporting gold and silver,
    equal to the difference of the value of traded goods. For this, they invented
    cheques, also known as bills of exchange . Think about the age in which European
    countries connected, with each other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th
    century. Goods, such as spices, flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid
    for with an equivalent flow of silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same
    time, there was a reverse flow of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam,
    and silver going from Amsterdam to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to
    be carried around, which had a cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money
    was costly; it was, after all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for
    robbery. Bankers made most of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing
    cheques to their clients, which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in
    another city. So instead of moving silver in two directions, people could transport
    their money on their own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from
    people in both cities, and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and
    Brussels—the trade deficit—could be settled by transporting silver. The cost of
    money transports depended on the distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic
    Theory , 1755).These cheques or bills of exchange made payments between people
    more efficient. The vital fact to note is that those money transmitters came into
    existence because transporting the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had
    a job moving money from one place to the next because money was a material thing,
    and the risk was a physical threat. In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic
    update of a digital bank ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of
    getting robbed or the time spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern
    bank transfers are costly because they have to win and maintain the trust of their
    customers. We have to trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the
    buyer and seller, are a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and
    drawbacks of having a third party in the transaction are evident if we look at
    the history of money. However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making
    money-transferring third parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all
    the people of a city could teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand
    wave. In such a magical world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The
    most magical money we can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero
    friction. Does modern electronic money create that magical world? It almost does.
    A payment done by PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation
    of value. However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They
    hold your deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer
    that starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions
    about your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run
    an online international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many
    of them are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer?
    This type of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order,
    authorization, or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority
    of a nation-state because it can . It has value because they say so. You have
    to pay taxes with that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept
    it as payment. Authorities enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they
    arrest counterfeiters. In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin
    of fiat currency takes some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding
    of the gold and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity
    with a long history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available
    options to trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few
    decades, in retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account
    do not behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power
    every year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies
    is unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed
    database of every (…) transaction that has ever occurred on the network. “Distributed”
    here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded
    by every node in the network. There is no one central database.Bitcoin and Ethereum
    work on similar principles of decentralized transfer of value, but make different
    choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires to be a secure and reliable
    alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader mission: decentralized software
    applications, with a higher risk for the assets on its blockchain. Security and
    flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each blockchain chooses a balance
    between them, consciously or not.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to
    some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized control over transactions.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating them from any controlling
    or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the
    transactions they enable are also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding,
    without a third party. Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions
    quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto
    entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer
    vulnerable to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls
    the asset besides the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem?
    To understand the original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief
    history of finance. We will look at the economic function of each player in financial
    transactions, to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money
    as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the
    money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to
    keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way
    to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Bitcoin and Ethereum work on similar principles of decentralized transfer
    of value, but make different choices for their network. Whereas Bitcoin aspires
    to be a secure and reliable alternative financial system, Ethereum has a broader
    mission: decentralized software applications, with a higher risk for the assets
    on its blockchain. Security and flexibility are a fundamental tradeoff, and each
    blockchain chooses a balance between them, consciously or not.Within the world
    of finance, Bitcoin, and to some extent Ethereum, solve the problem of centralized
    control over transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum empower their users by liberating
    them from any controlling or regulating third parties. If cryptocurrencies are
    a new asset class, then the transactions they enable are also of a new class:
    digital transfer and value-holding, without a third party. Users need a new breed
    of companies that make those transactions quick, safe, and easy. In the introduction,
    I described the essence of crypto entrepreneurship as replacing a financial product
    or service that makes the customer vulnerable to a third party : a person, company,
    or institution that controls the asset besides the parties that transact. Why
    is the third party a problem? To understand the original reasons for a third party,
    we have to go over a brief history of finance. We will look at the economic function
    of each player in financial transactions, to understand the possibilities offered
    by an established blockchain.Money as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before
    the industrial revolution, the money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level
    of society, money is a way to keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of
    who owes what to whom, and a way to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done
    by bankers: transmitting payments. One of the essential functions of banks is
    to move money from one place to the next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled
    the balance of trade between cities and countries by transporting gold and silver,
    equal to the difference of the value of traded goods. For this, they invented
    cheques, also known as bills of exchange . Think about the age in which European
    countries connected, with each other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th
    century. Goods, such as spices, flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid
    for with an equivalent flow of silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same
    time, there was a reverse flow of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam,
    and silver going from Amsterdam to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to
    be carried around, which had a cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money
    was costly; it was, after all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for
    robbery. Bankers made most of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing
    cheques to their clients, which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in
    another city. So instead of moving silver in two directions, people could transport
    their money on their own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from
    people in both cities, and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and
    Brussels—the trade deficit—could be settled by transporting silver. The cost of
    money transports depended on the distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic
    Theory , 1755).These cheques or bills of exchange made payments between people
    more efficient. The vital fact to note is that those money transmitters came into
    existence because transporting the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had
    a job moving money from one place to the next because money was a material thing,
    and the risk was a physical threat. In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic
    update of a digital bank ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of
    getting robbed or the time spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern
    bank transfers are costly because they have to win and maintain the trust of their
    customers. We have to trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the
    buyer and seller, are a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and
    drawbacks of having a third party in the transaction are evident if we look at
    the history of money. However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making
    money-transferring third parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all
    the people of a city could teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand
    wave. In such a magical world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The
    most magical money we can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero
    friction. Does modern electronic money create that magical world? It almost does.
    A payment done by PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation
    of value. However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They
    hold your deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer
    that starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions
    about your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run
    an online international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many
    of them are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer?
    This type of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order,
    authorization, or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority
    of a nation-state because it can . It has value because they say so. You have
    to pay taxes with that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept
    it as payment. Authorities enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they
    arrest counterfeiters. In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin
    of fiat currency takes some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding
    of the gold and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity
    with a long history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available
    options to trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few
    decades, in retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account
    do not behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power
    every year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies
    is unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Within the world of finance, Bitcoin, and to some extent Ethereum, solve
    the problem of centralized control over transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum empower
    their users by liberating them from any controlling or regulating third parties.
    If cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, then the transactions they enable are
    also of a new class: digital transfer and value-holding, without a third party.
    Users need a new breed of companies that make those transactions quick, safe,
    and easy. In the introduction, I described the essence of crypto entrepreneurship
    as replacing a financial product or service that makes the customer vulnerable
    to a third party : a person, company, or institution that controls the asset besides
    the parties that transact. Why is the third party a problem? To understand the
    original reasons for a third party, we have to go over a brief history of finance.
    We will look at the economic function of each player in financial transactions,
    to understand the possibilities offered by an established blockchain.Money as
    Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the money
    was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to keep
    score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way to
    transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Money as Scarce StuffIn agricultural societies before the industrial
    revolution, the money was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money
    is a way to keep score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom,
    and a way to transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting
    payments. One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place
    to the next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between
    cities and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference
    of the value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills
    of exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with
    each other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.In agricultural societies before the industrial revolution, the money
    was gold, silver, and copper. At the level of society, money is a way to keep
    score. Or: Money is a way to keep track of who owes what to whom, and a way to
    transfer value. That was one of the jobs done by bankers: transmitting payments.
    One of the essential functions of banks is to move money from one place to the
    next while keeping it secure. Bankers settled the balance of trade between cities
    and countries by transporting gold and silver, equal to the difference of the
    value of traded goods. For this, they invented cheques, also known as bills of
    exchange . Think about the age in which European countries connected, with each
    other and other continents, in the 16th or 17th century. Goods, such as spices,
    flowed from Amsterdam to Brussels, and were paid for with an equivalent flow of
    silver from Brussels to Amsterdam. At the same time, there was a reverse flow
    of goods, such as wine, from Brussels to Amsterdam, and silver going from Amsterdam
    to Brussels to pay for that wine. Silver had to be carried around, which had a
    cost and a risk. That meant that transporting money was costly; it was, after
    all, a precious, physical commodity, and at risk for robbery. Bankers made most
    of these physical transports unnecessary by issuing cheques to their clients,
    which they could cash in at the corresponding bank in another city. So instead
    of moving silver in two directions, people could transport their money on their
    own with a cheque. Bankers issued and accepted cheques from people in both cities,
    and the difference in traded value between Amsterdam and Brussels—the trade deficit—could
    be settled by transporting silver. The cost of money transports depended on the
    distance and risk (Cantillon, An Essay in Economic Theory , 1755).These cheques
    or bills of exchange made payments between people more efficient. The vital fact
    to note is that those money transmitters came into existence because transporting
    the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving money from one place
    to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk was a physical threat.
    In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic update of a digital bank
    ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of getting robbed or the time
    spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern bank transfers are costly
    because they have to win and maintain the trust of their customers. We have to
    trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the buyer and seller, are
    a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and drawbacks of having a
    third party in the transaction are evident if we look at the history of money.
    However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making money-transferring third
    parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could
    teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical
    world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we
    can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern
    electronic money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by
    PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value.
    However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your
    deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that
    starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about
    your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online
    international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them
    are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type
    of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization,
    or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.These cheques or bills of exchange made payments between people more
    efficient. The vital fact to note is that those money transmitters came into existence
    because transporting the physical commodity was costly. Bankers had a job moving
    money from one place to the next because money was a material thing, and the risk
    was a physical threat. In the present, transferring money is a near-automatic
    update of a digital bank ledger. The costs are not about the physical risk of
    getting robbed or the time spent on the road with a bag of cash. Instead, modern
    bank transfers are costly because they have to win and maintain the trust of their
    customers. We have to trust the bank to maintain the ledger. They, besides the
    buyer and seller, are a third party to the transaction. Both the necessity and
    drawbacks of having a third party in the transaction are evident if we look at
    the history of money. However, cryptocurrencies address the drawbacks by making
    money-transferring third parties obsolete.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all
    the people of a city could teleport money to their suppliers with a magical hand
    wave. In such a magical world, the job of transmitting money does not exist. The
    most magical money we can imagine is money that moves between owners with zero
    friction. Does modern electronic money create that magical world? It almost does.
    A payment done by PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation
    of value. However, we still require a business relationship with a bank. They
    hold your deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer
    that starts with your magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions
    about your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run
    an online international company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many
    of them are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer?
    This type of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order,
    authorization, or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority
    of a nation-state because it can . It has value because they say so. You have
    to pay taxes with that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept
    it as payment. Authorities enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they
    arrest counterfeiters. In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin
    of fiat currency takes some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding
    of the gold and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity
    with a long history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available
    options to trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few
    decades, in retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account
    do not behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power
    every year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies
    is unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Money as Trusted NumbersImagine if all the people of a city could teleport
    money to their suppliers with a magical hand wave. In such a magical world, the
    job of transmitting money does not exist. The most magical money we can imagine
    is money that moves between owners with zero friction. Does modern electronic
    money create that magical world? It almost does. A payment done by PayPal, Transferwise,
    or SWIFT feels close to the magical teleportation of value. However, we still
    require a business relationship with a bank. They hold your deposit of digital
    currency. You have to trust them to execute the transfer that starts with your
    magical payment. If they fail to do so or have questions about your payment, your
    business is on hold. Ask travelers or people that run an online international
    company how these money transmitters make them feel. Many of them are unhappy
    customers.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type of money is
    created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization, or
    sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Imagine if all the people of a city could teleport money to their suppliers
    with a magical hand wave. In such a magical world, the job of transmitting money
    does not exist. The most magical money we can imagine is money that moves between
    owners with zero friction. Does modern electronic money create that magical world?
    It almost does. A payment done by PayPal, Transferwise, or SWIFT feels close to
    the magical teleportation of value. However, we still require a business relationship
    with a bank. They hold your deposit of digital currency. You have to trust them
    to execute the transfer that starts with your magical payment. If they fail to
    do so or have questions about your payment, your business is on hold. Ask travelers
    or people that run an online international company how these money transmitters
    make them feel. Many of them are unhappy customers.Besides, what is the thing
    that banks transfer? This type of money is created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’
    an arbitrary order, authorization, or sanction. Fiat money is created by the single
    sovereign authority of a nation-state because it can . It has value because they
    say so. You have to pay taxes with that money, and often people are legally obligated
    to accept it as payment. Authorities enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws,
    and they arrest counterfeiters. In contrast to commodity money, understanding

    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Besides, what is the thing that banks transfer? This type of money is
    created by fiat , which means ‘decree,’ an arbitrary order, authorization, or
    sanction. Fiat money is created by the single sovereign authority of a nation-state
    because it can . It has value because they say so. You have to pay taxes with
    that money, and often people are legally obligated to accept it as payment. Authorities
    enforce the scarcity of fiat money with laws, and they arrest counterfeiters.
    In contrast to commodity money, understanding the origin of fiat currency takes
    some study. Pre-industrial merchants had a visceral understanding of the gold
    and silver they accepted as payment. Precious metals were a commodity with a long
    history. People agreed on its uses. They could trust their available options to
    trade it for other things. The same day, the day after, or in a few decades, in
    retirement. In contrast, the numbers in a modern merchant’s bank account do not
    behave like precious metals. These numbers lose a bit of purchasing power every
    year through inflation. The price of a currency relative to other currencies is
    unpredictable, in addition to the already variable price differences of goods
    between countries. Modern merchants and consumers understand their fiat money
    too ; most of them avoid keeping large amounts in their accounts. They invest
    a portion of their fiat money into other assets that will hold their value, and
    the remainder is for spending.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat
    for payments, or pre-industrial merchants using precious metals, we can be sure
    that they all managed their money according to their rational self-interest. And
    since fiat currency is very much unlike precious metals, its owners naturally
    behave differently.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians
    had financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did
    use cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They
    used these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However,
    they never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency

    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets

    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Whether we consider modern merchants using fiat for payments, or pre-industrial
    merchants using precious metals, we can be sure that they all managed their money
    according to their rational self-interest. And since fiat currency is very much
    unlike precious metals, its owners naturally behave differently.In pre-industrial
    economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians had financial instruments other
    than metal money. As mentioned above, they did use cheques to settle trade, and
    letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They used these instruments instead
    of money when necessary or convenient. However, they never confused these financial
    instruments with money itself, which was strictly metal. We can assume that most
    people understood why precious metals had value. They had an accurate and intuitive
    sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver, and copper. Their monetary landscape
    was much more straightforward than ours. Pre-industrial money was always a kind
    of physical stuff that behaved strictly according to the limits of physics, and
    they never confused it with the bills of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality
    and Origin of MoneyWe know that a range of commodities served as money throughout
    history, including seashells, gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo,
    Shelling Out: The Origins of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper
    and electronic form. We can compare these types of money in at least two ways:
    the place it originates and its physicality. The commodities that served as money
    in the past were a natural part of the environment. For example, gems and metals
    come out of the ground, and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring
    these commodities took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed
    across society and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state
    and banks. The central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which
    are usually government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial
    banks can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions

    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no

    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.In pre-industrial economies, bankers, merchants, and politicians had
    financial instruments other than metal money. As mentioned above, they did use
    cheques to settle trade, and letters of credit, shares, and banknotes. They used
    these instruments instead of money when necessary or convenient. However, they
    never confused these financial instruments with money itself, which was strictly
    metal. We can assume that most people understood why precious metals had value.
    They had an accurate and intuitive sense of the exchange rates between gold, silver,
    and copper. Their monetary landscape was much more straightforward than ours.
    Pre-industrial money was always a kind of physical stuff that behaved strictly
    according to the limits of physics, and they never confused it with the bills
    of exchange that represented the commodity.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know
    that a range of commodities served as money throughout history, including seashells,
    gemstones, beads, gold and silver coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins
    of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have fiat money in paper and electronic form. We
    can compare these types of money in at least two ways: the place it originates
    and its physicality. The commodities that served as money in the past were a natural
    part of the environment. For example, gems and metals come out of the ground,
    and people have to collect seashells from the sea. Acquiring these commodities
    took work. However, the ability to do this work was distributed across society
    and location. In contrast, modern fiat money belongs to the state and banks. The
    central bank creates the money to pay for the assets it buys, which are usually
    government bonds, which are debt that the government owes. Then commercial banks
    can lend out this created money again. It takes no work to create this money.
    The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the
    use of the fiat currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation
    of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency,
    commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power
    to create fiat is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed.
    The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency
    is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical;
    it changed from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the
    money supply is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better
    ways of transmitting, saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money
    that are easier to handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit
    and bills of exchange, and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking,
    in which only a small portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available
    for withdrawal (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of
    money enable us to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical
    commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by
    a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper
    fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat
    money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by
    the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to
    companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that

    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Physicality and Origin of MoneyWe know that a range of commodities served
    as money throughout history, including seashells, gemstones, beads, gold and silver
    coins (Nick Szabo, Shelling Out: The Origins of Money, 2002). Nowadays, we have
    fiat money in paper and electronic form. We can compare these types of money in
    at least two ways: the place it originates and its physicality. The commodities
    that served as money in the past were a natural part of the environment. For example,
    gems and metals come out of the ground, and people have to collect seashells from
    the sea. Acquiring these commodities took work. However, the ability to do this
    work was distributed across society and location. In contrast, modern fiat money
    belongs to the state and banks. The central bank creates the money to pay for
    the assets it buys, which are usually government bonds, which are debt that the
    government owes. Then commercial banks can lend out this created money again.
    It takes no work to create this money. The only requirements are:•    Sovereignty
    , that is, the ability to enforce the use of the fiat currency within a geographic
    region.•    The strict regulation of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In
    contrast to fiat currency, commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple
    entrepreneurs. The power to create fiat is central, while the ability to create
    a commodity is distributed. The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust.
    The scarcity of fiat currency is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of
    banking, money became less physical; it changed from a valued commodity into a
    record of a transaction. Most of the money supply is now merely records of who
    owes what to whom. By finding better ways of transmitting, saving, and investing
    money, bankers created kinds of money that are easier to handle. In essence, you
    can send money with letters of credit and bills of exchange, and you can create
    more of it by fractional reserve banking, in which only a small portion of bank
    deposits are backed by actual cash and available for withdrawal (Investopedia).The
    characteristics of physicality and origin of money enable us to differentiate
    between the following kinds of money:•    physical commodity money mined and collected
    by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by a private bank or a government, backed
    by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper fiat money issued by a central bank
    of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital
    fiat money issued by the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated
    banks lend out to companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private,
    entrepreneurial entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have
    been tried and have failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed
    with the invention of cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can
    appreciate the power of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money
    that came close to the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve
    global distribution. Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money,
    and e-gold is private digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship,
    which reveals the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed
    by local authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local
    governments meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples
    include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora,
    Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money
    as payment at the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust
    allow them to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The
    national government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows
    it. However, issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold,
    tends to be forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians

    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.•    Sovereignty , that is, the ability to enforce the use of the fiat
    currency within a geographic region.•    The strict regulation of the banks, who
    keep track of people’s balances.In contrast to fiat currency, commodity money
    is created by the hard work of multiple entrepreneurs. The power to create fiat
    is central, while the ability to create a commodity is distributed. The scarcity
    of commodities is natural and robust. The scarcity of fiat currency is artificial
    and fragile. Since the invention of banking, money became less physical; it changed
    from a valued commodity into a record of a transaction. Most of the money supply
    is now merely records of who owes what to whom. By finding better ways of transmitting,
    saving, and investing money, bankers created kinds of money that are easier to
    handle. In essence, you can send money with letters of credit and bills of exchange,
    and you can create more of it by fractional reserve banking, in which only a small
    portion of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and available for withdrawal
    (Investopedia).The characteristics of physicality and origin of money enable us
    to differentiate between the following kinds of money:•    physical commodity
    money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by a private
    bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper fiat
    money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat money
    issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by the
    central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to companies
    and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial entity
    or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have failed,
    such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of cryptocurrency,
    with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power of cryptocurrency
    by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to the idea of digital,
    distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution. Local fiat currencies
    are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private digital money. Both
    failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals the unique qualities
    of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local authorities to stimulate
    the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments meet with small businesses
    to print that local fiat currency. Examples include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares,
    Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc.
    People can agree to accept this money as payment at the same value as the national
    currency. The small scale and trust allow them to act as a central bank to print
    money and boost local commerce. The national government sees these small-scale
    projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However, issuing private money as a
    company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be forbidden by national governments.
    E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed money. That type of money scratches
    at the sovereign national currency. It also enabled money laundering and illegal
    transactions, which was the perfect excuse to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires
    the highest political authority, a sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance
    and scarcity of the national currency. In the 20th and 21st centuries, before
    cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust the bank. You did not have a choice.
    That is why bankers complied with strict regulations, their offices feature granite,
    and they wear suits. Fiat currency relies on the political power of the sovereign
    and the fact that the public trusts banks. The sovereign state and banks are both
    necessary and sufficient for fiat currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their
    control of financial markets and transactions, protected by regulations, which
    form a barrier to entry. Real capitalism is based on healthy competition, but
    with a monopoly on the field, the free market stops working. Business becomes
    political. The documentary Saving Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of
    the situation in the United States. In Europe, similar voices are pointing at
    their own broken systems. Japan has been having monetary problems for decades.
    Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the public has been feeling that something
    was wrong, but it takes time for researchers, artists, and producers to make those
    failings accessible to our layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations
    of physicality, government control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes
    of a scarce commodity that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a
    bank ledger. And yet, it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor
    trusted institutions to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions

    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.•    The strict regulation of the banks, who keep track of people’s balances.In
    contrast to fiat currency, commodity money is created by the hard work of multiple
    entrepreneurs. The power to create fiat is central, while the ability to create
    a commodity is distributed. The scarcity of commodities is natural and robust.
    The scarcity of fiat currency is artificial and fragile. Since the invention of
    banking, money became less physical; it changed from a valued commodity into a
    record of a transaction. Most of the money supply is now merely records of who
    owes what to whom. By finding better ways of transmitting, saving, and investing
    money, bankers created kinds of money that are easier to handle. In essence, you
    can send money with letters of credit and bills of exchange, and you can create
    more of it by fractional reserve banking, in which only a small portion of bank
    deposits are backed by actual cash and available for withdrawal (Investopedia).The
    characteristics of physicality and origin of money enable us to differentiate
    between the following kinds of money:•    physical commodity money mined and collected
    by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by a private bank or a government, backed
    by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper fiat money issued by a central bank
    of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital
    fiat money issued by the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated
    banks lend out to companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private,
    entrepreneurial entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have
    been tried and have failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed
    with the invention of cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can
    appreciate the power of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money
    that came close to the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve
    global distribution. Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money,
    and e-gold is private digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship,
    which reveals the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed
    by local authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local
    governments meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples
    include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora,
    Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money
    as payment at the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust
    allow them to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The
    national government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows
    it. However, issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold,
    tends to be forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.

    issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued by the
    central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out to companies
    and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial entity
    or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have failed,
    such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of cryptocurrency,
    with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power of cryptocurrency
    by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to the idea of digital,
    distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution. Local fiat currencies
    are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private digital money. Both
    failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals the unique qualities
    of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local authorities to stimulate
    the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments meet with small businesses
    to print that local fiat currency. Examples include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares,
    Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc.
    People can agree to accept this money as payment at the same value as the national
    currency. The small scale and trust allow them to act as a central bank to print
    money and boost local commerce. The national government sees these small-scale
    projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However, issuing private money as a
    company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be forbidden by national governments.
    E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed money. That type of money scratches
    at the sovereign national currency. It also enabled money laundering and illegal
    transactions, which was the perfect excuse to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires
    the highest political authority, a sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance
    and scarcity of the national currency. In the 20th and 21st centuries, before
    cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust the bank. You did not have a choice.
    That is why bankers complied with strict regulations, their offices feature granite,
    and they wear suits. Fiat currency relies on the political power of the sovereign
    and the fact that the public trusts banks. The sovereign state and banks are both
    necessary and sufficient for fiat currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their
    control of financial markets and transactions, protected by regulations, which
    form a barrier to entry. Real capitalism is based on healthy competition, but
    with a monopoly on the field, the free market stops working. Business becomes
    political. The documentary Saving Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of
    the situation in the United States. In Europe, similar voices are pointing at
    their own broken systems. Japan has been having monetary problems for decades.
    Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the public has been feeling that something
    was wrong, but it takes time for researchers, artists, and producers to make those
    failings accessible to our layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations
    of physicality, government control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes
    of a scarce commodity that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a
    bank ledger. And yet, it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor
    trusted institutions to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions
    that we can not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions
    no longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.The characteristics of physicality and origin of money enable us to differentiate
    between the following kinds of money:•    physical commodity money mined and collected
    by entrepreneurs;•    paper money issued by a private bank or a government, backed
    by commodities it holds in deposit;•    paper fiat money issued by a central bank
    of a sovereign government;•    paper fiat money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital
    fiat money issued by the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated
    banks lend out to companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private,
    entrepreneurial entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have
    been tried and have failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed
    with the invention of cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can
    appreciate the power of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money
    that came close to the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve
    global distribution. Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money,
    and e-gold is private digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship,
    which reveals the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed
    by local authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local
    governments meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples
    include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora,
    Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money
    as payment at the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust

    it. However, issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold,
    tends to be forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed

    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.•    physical commodity money mined and collected by entrepreneurs;•    paper
    money issued by a private bank or a government, backed by commodities it holds
    in deposit;•    paper fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper
    fiat money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital fiat money issued
    by the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated banks lend out
    to companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial
    entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have
    failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of
    cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power
    of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to
    the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution.
    Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private
    digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals
    the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local
    authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments
    meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples include
    the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese
    dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money as payment at
    the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust allow them
    to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The national
    government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However,
    issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be
    forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.

    banks lend out to companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private,
    entrepreneurial entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have
    been tried and have failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed
    with the invention of cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can
    appreciate the power of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money
    that came close to the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve
    global distribution. Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money,
    and e-gold is private digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship,
    which reveals the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed
    by local authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local
    governments meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples
    include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora,
    Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money
    as payment at the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust
    allow them to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The
    national government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows
    it. However, issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold,
    tends to be forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.•    paper fiat money issued by a central bank of a sovereign government;•    paper

    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.•    paper fiat money issued by local or regional cooperative;•    digital
    fiat money issued by the central bank of a sovereign government, which regulated
    banks lend out to companies and individuals;•    digital money issued by a private,
    entrepreneurial entity or group. Although examples of that kind of money have
    been tried and have failed, such as E-gold, private digital money did succeed
    with the invention of cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can
    appreciate the power of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent examples of money
    that came close to the idea of digital, distributed money, but failed to achieve
    global distribution. Local fiat currencies are an example of distributed money,
    and e-gold is private digital money. Both failed the test of resistance to censorship,
    which reveals the unique qualities of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed
    by local authorities to stimulate the economy of a town or a wider region. Local
    governments meet with small businesses to print that local fiat currency. Examples
    include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora,
    Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People can agree to accept this money
    as payment at the same value as the national currency. The small scale and trust
    allow them to act as a central bank to print money and boost local commerce. The
    national government sees these small-scale projects as mostly harmless and allows
    it. However, issuing private money as a company, such as in the case of e-gold,
    tends to be forbidden by national governments. E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed
    money. That type of money scratches at the sovereign national currency. It also
    enabled money laundering and illegal transactions, which was the perfect excuse
    to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires the highest political authority, a
    sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance and scarcity of the national currency.
    In the 20th and 21st centuries, before cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust
    the bank. You did not have a choice. That is why bankers complied with strict
    regulations, their offices feature granite, and they wear suits. Fiat currency
    relies on the political power of the sovereign and the fact that the public trusts
    banks. The sovereign state and banks are both necessary and sufficient for fiat
    currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their control of financial markets
    and transactions, protected by regulations, which form a barrier to entry. Real
    capitalism is based on healthy competition, but with a monopoly on the field,
    the free market stops working. Business becomes political. The documentary Saving
    Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of the situation in the United States.
    In Europe, similar voices are pointing at their own broken systems. Japan has
    been having monetary problems for decades. Since the Great Financial Crisis of
    2008, the public has been feeling that something was wrong, but it takes time
    for researchers, artists, and producers to make those failings accessible to our
    layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government
    control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity
    that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet,
    it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions
    to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions that we can
    not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no
    longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central

    that local fiat currency. Examples include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt
    Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People
    can agree to accept this money as payment at the same value as the national currency.
    The small scale and trust allow them to act as a central bank to print money and
    boost local commerce. The national government sees these small-scale projects
    as mostly harmless and allows it. However, issuing private money as a company,
    such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be forbidden by national governments.
    E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed money. That type of money scratches
    at the sovereign national currency. It also enabled money laundering and illegal
    transactions, which was the perfect excuse to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires
    the highest political authority, a sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance
    and scarcity of the national currency. In the 20th and 21st centuries, before
    cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust the bank. You did not have a choice.
    That is why bankers complied with strict regulations, their offices feature granite,
    and they wear suits. Fiat currency relies on the political power of the sovereign
    and the fact that the public trusts banks. The sovereign state and banks are both
    necessary and sufficient for fiat currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their
    control of financial markets and transactions, protected by regulations, which
    form a barrier to entry. Real capitalism is based on healthy competition, but
    with a monopoly on the field, the free market stops working. Business becomes
    political. The documentary Saving Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of
    the situation in the United States. In Europe, similar voices are pointing at
    their own broken systems. Japan has been having monetary problems for decades.
    Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the public has been feeling that something
    was wrong, but it takes time for researchers, artists, and producers to make those
    failings accessible to our layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations
    of physicality, government control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes
    of a scarce commodity that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a
    bank ledger. And yet, it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor
    trusted institutions to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions
    that we can not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions
    no longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.•    digital money issued by a private, entrepreneurial entity or group.
    Although examples of that kind of money have been tried and have failed, such
    as E-gold, private digital money did succeed with the invention of cryptocurrency,
    with Bitcoin as its first instance.We can appreciate the power of cryptocurrency
    by looking at two recent examples of money that came close to the idea of digital,
    distributed money, but failed to achieve global distribution. Local fiat currencies
    are an example of distributed money, and e-gold is private digital money. Both
    failed the test of resistance to censorship, which reveals the unique qualities
    of cryptocurrency. Local fiat currency is printed by local authorities to stimulate
    the economy of a town or a wider region. Local governments meet with small businesses
    to print that local fiat currency. Examples include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares,
    Salt Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc.
    People can agree to accept this money as payment at the same value as the national
    currency. The small scale and trust allow them to act as a central bank to print
    money and boost local commerce. The national government sees these small-scale
    projects as mostly harmless and allows it. However, issuing private money as a
    company, such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be forbidden by national governments.

    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.We can appreciate the power of cryptocurrency by looking at two recent
    examples of money that came close to the idea of digital, distributed money, but
    failed to achieve global distribution. Local fiat currencies are an example of
    distributed money, and e-gold is private digital money. Both failed the test of
    resistance to censorship, which reveals the unique qualities of cryptocurrency.
    Local fiat currency is printed by local authorities to stimulate the economy of
    a town or a wider region. Local governments meet with small businesses to print
    that local fiat currency. Examples include the Brixton Pound, BerkShares, Salt
    Spring Dollars, Bangla-Pesa, Ora, Kalentalese dinar, caribe, Fausto, etc. People
    can agree to accept this money as payment at the same value as the national currency.
    The small scale and trust allow them to act as a central bank to print money and
    boost local commerce. The national government sees these small-scale projects
    as mostly harmless and allows it. However, issuing private money as a company,
    such as in the case of e-gold, tends to be forbidden by national governments.
    E-gold was private, digital, commodity-backed money. That type of money scratches
    at the sovereign national currency. It also enabled money laundering and illegal
    transactions, which was the perfect excuse to shut e-gold down.Fiat currency requires
    the highest political authority, a sovereign power, to enforce the acceptance
    and scarcity of the national currency. In the 20th and 21st centuries, before
    cryptocurrency existed, you had to trust the bank. You did not have a choice.
    That is why bankers complied with strict regulations, their offices feature granite,
    and they wear suits. Fiat currency relies on the political power of the sovereign
    and the fact that the public trusts banks. The sovereign state and banks are both
    necessary and sufficient for fiat currency to work. Banks are comfortable in their
    control of financial markets and transactions, protected by regulations, which
    form a barrier to entry. Real capitalism is based on healthy competition, but
    with a monopoly on the field, the free market stops working. Business becomes
    political. The documentary Saving Capitalism by Robert Reich describes part of
    the situation in the United States. In Europe, similar voices are pointing at
    their own broken systems. Japan has been having monetary problems for decades.
    Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the public has been feeling that something
    was wrong, but it takes time for researchers, artists, and producers to make those
    failings accessible to our layman understanding.Bitcoin transcends the limitations
    of physicality, government control, and the origins of money. It has the attributes
    of a scarce commodity that requires work to be made, and it is digital like a
    bank ledger. And yet, it requires neither a sovereign who declares it money nor
    trusted institutions to transfer it. This new type of money enables economic transactions
    that we can not yet even imagine. What we do know is that from now on, our transactions
    no longer require that third party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency,
    national fiat currency, and private digital commodity currency have failed in
    ways that show the unique strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens,
    issued and distributed by multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant
    system of checks and balances.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale.
    It is a commodity, transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals.
    The features of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities
    in high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers
    is no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the
    extent that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an
    alternative to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system,
    or you can trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with
    fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those
    payments and financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover
    these cases in later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason
    to innovate. Their methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking
    on risk or hard work.The properties of money show that it requires trust in the
    stability of its value, for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable
    in the short and medium term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run.
    Whatever people use as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something
    can only be rare in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume
    the role of money only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case
    of Bitcoin, it had value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor.
    Owning Bitcoin implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was
    better than both fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate
    money can only succeed if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions.
    It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments
    want to prevent private money transactions: it is a challenge to the business
    model of public funding. There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives
    them more power and financial control over the population. Historically, the need
    for that control was to defend the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William
    Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states
    have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents.
    Private money that circulates widely would challenge the interests of nation-states,
    so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin
    is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which,
    if you choose to, only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger.
    Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having
    to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and
    immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work
    algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical
    computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations. All are working with
    the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same
    rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin.
    Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where
    anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable,
    immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends
    on decentralization, which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in
    the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to
    be decentralized because there is a long history of people issuing private currencies.
    At first, it used to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until
    the introduction of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue
    a local currency. The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was
    DigiCash, and the first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As
    mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid
    and stop private digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto,
    the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private
    currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate
    without needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the
    problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a
    practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem
    of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted.
    That was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens
    that are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software
    did not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat
    currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming
    did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target
    that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”

    can trust the banker and the whole regulated system, or you can trust an immutable
    blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with fiat currency or cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those payments and financial instruments
    the banking system fails at. We will cover these cases in later chapters. For
    now, consider that a bank has little reason to innovate. Their methods are an
    easier, safer way to profit, without taking on risk or hard work.The properties
    of money show that it requires trust in the stability of its value, for a given
    time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable in the short and medium term,
    whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run. Whatever people use as money,
    it has to be good for something and scarce. Something can only be rare in a meaningful
    way if it also has value. A commodity can assume the role of money only after
    it is wanted for another reason first. In the case of Bitcoin, it had value as
    a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor. Owning Bitcoin implied that
    you could imagine the possibility of money that was better than both fiat currency
    and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate money can only succeed if the
    state cannot stop its issuance and transactions. It needs a quality that makes
    it unstoppable. We already know that governments want to prevent private money
    transactions: it is a challenge to the business model of public funding. There
    is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives them more power and financial
    control over the population. Historically, the need for that control was to defend
    the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign
    Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states have become bloated hierarchies
    that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents. Private money that circulates
    widely would challenge the interests of nation-states, so it can only succeed
    if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin is unique in that it
    uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which, if you choose to,
    only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger. Bitcoin’s immutability
    is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having to trust an identifiable
    authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and immutable because it is
    decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work algorithm for distributed
    consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical computers (“machines”)
    in many different physical locations. All are working with the same ledger with
    blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same rules for achieving
    consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin
    runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where anyone could
    go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable, immutable,
    and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends on decentralization,
    which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in the case of Bitcoin,
    depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to be decentralized because
    there is a long history of people issuing private currencies. At first, it used
    to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until the introduction
    of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue a local currency.
    The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was DigiCash, and the
    first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As mentioned above,
    the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid and stop private
    digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous
    inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private currency. The
    new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate without
    needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the problem
    of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a practical
    solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem of
    ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted. That
    was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens that
    are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software did
    not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat currencies
    at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming did not pay
    much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target that few
    could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Bitcoin transcends the limitations of physicality, government control,
    and the origins of money. It has the attributes of a scarce commodity that requires
    work to be made, and it is digital like a bank ledger. And yet, it requires neither
    a sovereign who declares it money nor trusted institutions to transfer it. This
    new type of money enables economic transactions that we can not yet even imagine.
    What we do know is that from now on, our transactions no longer require that third
    party.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency, national fiat currency,
    and private digital commodity currency have failed in ways that show the unique
    strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens, issued and distributed by
    multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant system of checks and balances.People
    can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale. It is a commodity, transacted across
    the globe, by private companies and individuals. The features of cryptocurrencies
    are a digital version of what puts physical commodities in high demand. Since
    the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers is no longer a required
    ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the extent that Bitcoin and
    other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an alternative to banks. You
    can trust the banker and the whole regulated system, or you can trust an immutable
    blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with fiat currency or cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those payments and financial instruments
    the banking system fails at. We will cover these cases in later chapters. For
    now, consider that a bank has little reason to innovate. Their methods are an
    easier, safer way to profit, without taking on risk or hard work.The properties

    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Money as Scarce Digital DigitsLocal fiat currency, national fiat currency,
    and private digital commodity currency have failed in ways that show the unique
    strengths of cryptocurrencies: scarce digital tokens, issued and distributed by
    multiple entrepreneurial entities, through an elegant system of checks and balances.People
    can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale. It is a commodity, transacted across
    the globe, by private companies and individuals. The features of cryptocurrencies
    are a digital version of what puts physical commodities in high demand. Since
    the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers is no longer a required
    ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the extent that Bitcoin and
    other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an alternative to banks. You
    can trust the banker and the whole regulated system, or you can trust an immutable
    blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with fiat currency or cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those payments and financial instruments
    the banking system fails at. We will cover these cases in later chapters. For
    now, consider that a bank has little reason to innovate. Their methods are an
    easier, safer way to profit, without taking on risk or hard work.The properties
    of money show that it requires trust in the stability of its value, for a given
    time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable in the short and medium term,
    whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run. Whatever people use as money,
    it has to be good for something and scarce. Something can only be rare in a meaningful
    way if it also has value. A commodity can assume the role of money only after
    it is wanted for another reason first. In the case of Bitcoin, it had value as
    a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor. Owning Bitcoin implied that
    you could imagine the possibility of money that was better than both fiat currency
    and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate money can only succeed if the
    state cannot stop its issuance and transactions. It needs a quality that makes
    it unstoppable. We already know that governments want to prevent private money
    transactions: it is a challenge to the business model of public funding. There
    is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives them more power and financial
    control over the population. Historically, the need for that control was to defend
    the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign
    Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states have become bloated hierarchies
    that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents. Private money that circulates
    widely would challenge the interests of nation-states, so it can only succeed
    if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin is unique in that it
    uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which, if you choose to,
    only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger. Bitcoin’s immutability
    is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having to trust an identifiable
    authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and immutable because it is
    decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work algorithm for distributed
    consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical computers (“machines”)
    in many different physical locations. All are working with the same ledger with
    blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same rules for achieving
    consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin
    runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where anyone could
    go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable, immutable,
    and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends on decentralization,
    which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in the case of Bitcoin,
    depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to be decentralized because
    there is a long history of people issuing private currencies. At first, it used
    to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until the introduction
    of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue a local currency.
    The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was DigiCash, and the
    first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As mentioned above,
    the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid and stop private
    digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous
    inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private currency. The
    new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate without
    needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the problem
    of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a practical
    solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem of
    ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted. That
    was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens that
    are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software did
    not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat currencies
    at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming did not pay
    much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target that few
    could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Local fiat currency, national fiat currency, and private digital commodity

    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.People can use cryptocurrencies on a global scale. It is a commodity,
    transacted across the globe, by private companies and individuals. The features
    of cryptocurrencies are a digital version of what puts physical commodities in
    high demand. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network, your trust in bankers is
    no longer a required ingredient of a transaction. People can choose. To the extent
    that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more liquid, we have an alternative
    to banks. You can trust the banker and the whole regulated system, or you can
    trust an immutable blockchain. You can choose to accept or pay with fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a candidate for making those payments and
    financial instruments the banking system fails at. We will cover these cases in
    later chapters. For now, consider that a bank has little reason to innovate. Their
    methods are an easier, safer way to profit, without taking on risk or hard work.The
    properties of money show that it requires trust in the stability of its value,
    for a given time horizon. Fiat currencies tend to be stable in the short and medium
    term, whereas gold and silver are stable in the long run. Whatever people use
    as money, it has to be good for something and scarce. Something can only be rare
    in a meaningful way if it also has value. A commodity can assume the role of money
    only after it is wanted for another reason first. In the case of Bitcoin, it had
    value as a digital collectible and an economic badge of honor. Owning Bitcoin
    implied that you could imagine the possibility of money that was better than both
    fiat currency and commodity currency.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate money can only succeed
    if the state cannot stop its issuance and transactions. It needs a quality that
    makes it unstoppable. We already know that governments want to prevent private
    money transactions: it is a challenge to the business model of public funding.
    There is a reason the state created fiat money: it gives them more power and financial
    control over the population. Historically, the need for that control was to defend
    the nation in war (James Dale Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign
    Individual , 1999). In recent times, many nation-states have become bloated hierarchies
    that serve a class of bureaucrats and their dependents. Private money that circulates
    widely would challenge the interests of nation-states, so it can only succeed
    if they cannot stop it from being used as payment.Bitcoin is unique in that it
    uses cryptography to create a digitally scarce asset, which, if you choose to,
    only you control with a private key on an immutable ledger. Bitcoin’s immutability
    is a new quality. It has the advantage of no longer having to trust an identifiable
    authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin is unstoppable and immutable because it is
    decentralized. Its immutability depends on the proof-of-work algorithm for distributed
    consensus. Bitcoin is a network that runs on many physical computers (“machines”)
    in many different physical locations. All are working with the same ledger with
    blocks of the same transactions. They all follow the same rules for achieving
    consensus, which automates the issuance and scarcity of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin
    runs in so many places, there is no single ‘place’ anywhere where anyone could
    go to stop it. As long as the system works as designed, it is unstoppable, immutable,
    and uncensorable. That was a radical disruption. The immutability depends on decentralization,
    which in turn depends on a consensus algorithm, which, in the case of Bitcoin,
    depends on proof-of-work.We know that private money has to be decentralized because
    there is a long history of people issuing private currencies. At first, it used
    to be done by private banks, in the era of free banking, until the introduction
    of government fiat currency. In the present, some towns issue a local currency.
    The first digital currency that made use of cryptography was DigiCash, and the
    first private digital currency in circulation was e-gold. As mentioned above,
    the U.S. government shut down e-gold. This tendency to forbid and stop private
    digital currency was the reason why in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous
    inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way to decentralize private currency. The
    new digital currency had to have multiple nodes that could coordinate without
    needing to trust any individual node. That is why he had to solve the problem
    of reaching consensus. He could only invent Bitcoin because he found a practical
    solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’ which deals with the problem of
    ensuring a trusted consensus with participants that are not to be trusted. That
    was the audacious goal he took on and reached. The solution enables tokens that
    are digital and scarce at the same time. His Bitcoin solution and software did
    not get much attention at first because almost no one cared about non-fiat currencies
    at the time. Even most of his peers in cryptography and programming did not pay
    much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer: Nakamoto hit a money target that few
    could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals Problem was a multidisciplinary
    achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track when making sense of Bitcoin.
    A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook the reasons for its functioning
    in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission,
    and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political
    factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The
    key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee

    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely

    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency

    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Unstoppable MoneyPrivate money can only succeed if the state cannot stop
    its issuance and transactions. It needs a quality that makes it unstoppable. We
    already know that governments want to prevent private money transactions: it is
    a challenge to the business model of public funding. There is a reason the state
    created fiat money: it gives them more power and financial control over the population.
    Historically, the need for that control was to defend the nation in war (James
    Dale Davidson & Lord William Rees-Mogg, The Sovereign Individual , 1999). In recent
    times, many nation-states have become bloated hierarchies that serve a class of
    bureaucrats and their dependents. Private money that circulates widely would challenge
    the interests of nation-states, so it can only succeed if they cannot stop it
    from being used as payment.Bitcoin is unique in that it uses cryptography to create
    a digitally scarce asset, which, if you choose to, only you control with a private
    key on an immutable ledger. Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the
    advantage of no longer having to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank.
    Bitcoin is unstoppable and immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability
    depends on the proof-of-work algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a
    network that runs on many physical computers (“machines”) in many different physical
    locations. All are working with the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions.
    They all follow the same rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance
    and scarcity of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single
    ‘place’ anywhere where anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works
    as designed, it is unstoppable, immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical
    disruption. The immutability depends on decentralization, which in turn depends
    on a consensus algorithm, which, in the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We
    know that private money has to be decentralized because there is a long history
    of people issuing private currencies. At first, it used to be done by private
    banks, in the era of free banking, until the introduction of government fiat currency.
    In the present, some towns issue a local currency. The first digital currency
    that made use of cryptography was DigiCash, and the first private digital currency
    in circulation was e-gold. As mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold.
    This tendency to forbid and stop private digital currency was the reason why in
    2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way
    to decentralize private currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple
    nodes that could coordinate without needing to trust any individual node. That
    is why he had to solve the problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent
    Bitcoin because he found a practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’
    which deals with the problem of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants
    that are not to be trusted. That was the audacious goal he took on and reached.
    The solution enables tokens that are digital and scarce at the same time. His
    Bitcoin solution and software did not get much attention at first because almost
    no one cared about non-fiat currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in
    cryptography and programming did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer:
    Nakamoto hit a money target that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals
    Problem was a multidisciplinary achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track
    when making sense of Bitcoin. A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook
    the reasons for its functioning in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical
    sense of money transmission, and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we
    can appreciate the political factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial
    opportunity.The key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency

    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Bitcoin is unique in that it uses cryptography to create a digitally
    scarce asset, which, if you choose to, only you control with a private key on
    an immutable ledger. Bitcoin’s immutability is a new quality. It has the advantage
    of no longer having to trust an identifiable authority, such as a bank. Bitcoin
    is unstoppable and immutable because it is decentralized. Its immutability depends
    on the proof-of-work algorithm for distributed consensus. Bitcoin is a network
    that runs on many physical computers (“machines”) in many different physical locations.
    All are working with the same ledger with blocks of the same transactions. They
    all follow the same rules for achieving consensus, which automates the issuance
    and scarcity of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin runs in so many places, there is no single
    ‘place’ anywhere where anyone could go to stop it. As long as the system works
    as designed, it is unstoppable, immutable, and uncensorable. That was a radical
    disruption. The immutability depends on decentralization, which in turn depends
    on a consensus algorithm, which, in the case of Bitcoin, depends on proof-of-work.We
    know that private money has to be decentralized because there is a long history
    of people issuing private currencies. At first, it used to be done by private
    banks, in the era of free banking, until the introduction of government fiat currency.
    In the present, some towns issue a local currency. The first digital currency
    that made use of cryptography was DigiCash, and the first private digital currency
    in circulation was e-gold. As mentioned above, the U.S. government shut down e-gold.
    This tendency to forbid and stop private digital currency was the reason why in
    2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, focused on the way
    to decentralize private currency. The new digital currency had to have multiple
    nodes that could coordinate without needing to trust any individual node. That
    is why he had to solve the problem of reaching consensus. He could only invent
    Bitcoin because he found a practical solution to ‘The Byzantine Generals Problem,’
    which deals with the problem of ensuring a trusted consensus with participants
    that are not to be trusted. That was the audacious goal he took on and reached.
    The solution enables tokens that are digital and scarce at the same time. His
    Bitcoin solution and software did not get much attention at first because almost
    no one cared about non-fiat currencies at the time. Even most of his peers in
    cryptography and programming did not pay much attention. To paraphrase Schopenhauer:
    Nakamoto hit a money target that few could even see. Solving the Byzantine Generals
    Problem was a multidisciplinary achievement. That is why it is so easy to go off-track
    when making sense of Bitcoin. A casual investigation of Bitcoin will overlook
    the reasons for its functioning in this way.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical
    sense of money transmission, and knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we
    can appreciate the political factor of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial
    opportunity.The key qualities of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness:
    it is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence

    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.The Politics of MoneyWith a historical sense of money transmission, and
    knowing that Bitcoin is unstoppable money, we can appreciate the political factor
    of money. This new angle enables a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity.The key qualities
    of Bitcoin are:1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness: it
    is easy to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate
    beyond the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets

    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.1.   Scarcity: it is hard to create;2.   User-friendliness: it is easy
    to hold, send, and receive;3.   Supply predictability: no one can inflate beyond
    the issuance schedule;4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance
    to confiscation and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had
    to be private money because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing
    a decentralized cryptocurrency. They can issue digital fiat currency already.
    There is no point in using a blockchain with a consensus algorithm because digital
    fiat currency does already function according to its purpose. Governments can
    only benefit from a decentralized currency indirectly, at a later stage of adoption,
    in case the top cryptocurrencies become viable assets for central bank balance
    sheets. The first central bank that expands their portfolio into cryptocurrency
    will have a first-mover advantage. If other central banks also buy, the price
    will rise further to a new and more stable level, securing a profit for the first
    mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not
    work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any
    decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies
    that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin
    described above is against the status quo; the political and economic elite has
    failed the public with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto
    enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting
    a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different
    models and theories about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing
    society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system
    will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,”
    according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency,
    is a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators
    of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money.
    Although different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind
    the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in
    handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail
    the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy.
    Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation,
    currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to
    Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why
    anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government
    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money

    do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything the government
    does for you comes at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else.
    In contrast, liberals, democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that
    governments deserve their place in the present and the future and that their officials
    will exercise sovereignty well enough. That includes the money system as it is.
    Politicians like fiat money. More specifically, they like the ability to create
    more money at little cost; they like taking on public debt, and the central planning
    of the interest rate. The official narrative around fiat currency presents the
    monetary status quo as necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends
    in part on fiat money, but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern
    sovereignty is a condition for the ability to print money.While fiat currency
    requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist
    that coercion while competing as a monetary good. This difference of political
    opinion between the mainstream and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path
    of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes open competition for monetary
    goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary pillar of the government.
    Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians only had debate
    and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary;
    they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial
    status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and the mainstream has become
    a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the
    door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting
    the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and
    libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows,
    fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then at some point, the weaker
    authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies that build on top
    of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing government and
    rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities,
    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.4.   Freedom: you can use it without permission;5.   Resistance to confiscation
    and censorship: it is difficult to seize.Cryptocurrencies had to be private money
    because it is unlikely that governments benefit from issuing a decentralized cryptocurrency.
    They can issue digital fiat currency already. There is no point in using a blockchain
    with a consensus algorithm because digital fiat currency does already function
    according to its purpose. Governments can only benefit from a decentralized currency
    indirectly, at a later stage of adoption, in case the top cryptocurrencies become
    viable assets for central bank balance sheets. The first central bank that expands
    their portfolio into cryptocurrency will have a first-mover advantage. If other
    central banks also buy, the price will rise further to a new and more stable level,
    securing a profit for the first mover.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the
    foundation of a new financial system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top
    of a money system without having to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at
    an early stage. These new types of financial services can only grow with the liquidity
    of the cryptocurrency. Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part
    of their life so that using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use
    products and services that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream
    until it is guaranteed to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency
    is widespread, your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This
    new financial system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit
    if they cannibalize their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there
    are a dozen central banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the
    national currency. In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met,
    this scheme can not work. Fiat currency is already digital; there is no need for
    a blockchain, any decentralized ledger, or consensus algorithm. These techniques
    only help currencies that lack the authority of a nation with a central bank.
    The proposition of Bitcoin described above is against the status quo; the political
    and economic elite has failed the public with regard to managing the money supply.
    According to crypto enthusiasts, they have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government
    is like trusting a parent—they may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists
    have different models and theories about parenting, politicians have different
    ideas about organizing society and the powers of authority. A good-enough government
    and legal system will have the power of authority, but only with the “consent
    of the governed,” according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin,
    the first cryptocurrency, is a charged political project because the creators
    and most of the innovators of Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over
    the creation of money. Although different types of activists vary in their political
    views, those behind the growth of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible
    track record in handling the supply of money. All political authority has failed
    or will fail the test for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of
    monetary policy. Financial history is riddled with instances of capital controls,
    asset confiscation, currency debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default
    (J.T. Reed, How to Protect Your Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression,
    2010). That is why anarchists and most libertarians believe that most or all parts
    of the government do not deserve your trust and support. They claim that anything

    of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not work. Fiat currency
    is already digital; there is no need for a blockchain, any decentralized ledger,
    or consensus algorithm. These techniques only help currencies that lack the authority
    of a nation with a central bank. The proposition of Bitcoin described above is
    against the status quo; the political and economic elite has failed the public
    with regard to managing the money supply. According to crypto enthusiasts, they
    have betrayed our trust.Trusting the government is like trusting a parent—they
    may or may not deserve it. Just as psychologists have different models and theories
    about parenting, politicians have different ideas about organizing society and
    the powers of authority. A good-enough government and legal system will have the
    power of authority, but only with the “consent of the governed,” according to
    the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is
    a charged political project because the creators and most of the innovators of
    Bitcoin reject the authority of any government over the creation of money. Although
    different types of activists vary in their political views, those behind the growth
    of Bitcoin maintain that governments have a terrible track record in handling
    the supply of money. All political authority has failed or will fail the test
    for being a ‘good-enough government’ within the realm of monetary policy. Financial
    history is riddled with instances of capital controls, asset confiscation, currency
    debasement, hyperinflation, and sovereign default (J.T. Reed, How to Protect Your
    Life Savings from Hyperinflation & Depression, 2010). That is why anarchists and
    most libertarians believe that most or all parts of the government do not deserve
    your trust and support. They claim that anything the government does for you comes
    at your expense, or at the greater expense of someone else. In contrast, liberals,
    democrats, republicans, and conservatives believe that governments deserve their
    place in the present and the future and that their officials will exercise sovereignty
    well enough. That includes the money system as it is. Politicians like fiat money.
    More specifically, they like the ability to create more money at little cost;
    they like taking on public debt, and the central planning of the interest rate.
    The official narrative around fiat currency presents the monetary status quo as
    necessary and proper. Mainstream political action depends in part on fiat money,
    but the official story hides this critical fact. Modern sovereignty is a condition
    for the ability to print money.While fiat currency requires the coercive power
    of a state, decentralized cryptocurrencies can resist that coercion while competing
    as a monetary good. This difference of political opinion between the mainstream
    and the creators of Bitcoin will shape the path of adoption for cryptocurrency
    because it unleashes open competition for monetary goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets
    weakens the monetary pillar of the government. Before Bitcoin was a monetary good,
    anarchists and libertarians only had debate and rhetoric as tools of persuasion.
    After Bitcoin, no more debate is necessary; they can act on their conviction by
    holding crypto-assets. They can exit the financial status quo. A pointless discussion
    between a minority and the mainstream has become a material contest, to be fought
    with disruptive money. Cryptocurrency opens the door to exit the fiat monetary
    system. Whoever takes that exit, stops supporting the political mainstream. With
    every holder of cryptocurrency, the anarchist and libertarian case gains strength.
    As the decentralized power of crypto-assets grows, fiat currency weakens. If that
    process continues, then at some point, the weaker authority will start to fail
    at regulation of the companies that build on top of cryptocurrencies. This could
    start a feedback loop of failing government and rising influence for the holders
    of crypto-assets.Governments, as sovereign entities, are not usually thought of
    as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence is only challenged by other
    nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with debatable ethics, also known
    as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s monopoly in the domain
    of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option to compete with the
    government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money was not done. Even
    if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local currency or currency
    for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at money, such as e-gold,
    were futile because they could easily be stopped. However, Bitcoin could—and most
    likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency to have a chance to challenge
    the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and edgy. It was a new way in which
    political minorities could exit the financial status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin
    was not subject to overt attempts to stop it. One reason is that most government
    officials and central bankers have not made up their minds about it. Even if they
    are vaguely against it, they do not know what they are looking at. This is obvious
    when you see a parliamentary committee investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing
    central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners, and traditional finance types.
    Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians say they want cryptocurrencies
    outlawed because they undermine the interests of the U.S.A. They know what they
    are looking at: much of the geopolitical power of the U.S. comes from the U.S.
    dollar as an international reserve currency. However, most politicians and central
    bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency. They take their old yardstick
    for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency does not resemble
    fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely new asset class.
    Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed a new asset class
    because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity, undoubtedly similar
    to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central bank assets. But
    in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became money, and then
    went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like for gold holders
    and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become money. It has
    all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones, such as the
    ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and politicians
    tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but their frame
    is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that most governments
    do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion from crystallizing
    against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem and make it even
    more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians fail to grasp
    cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments in Bitcoin,
    other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires basic
    knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into the details,
    which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician, finance
    MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position to
    gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets through
    the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.Cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets are the foundation of a new financial
    system. An entrepreneur can build a company on top of a money system without having
    to talk to bankers. Note that we are still at an early stage. These new types
    of financial services can only grow with the liquidity of the cryptocurrency.
    Your customers have to see crypto-assets as a regular part of their life so that
    using them causes zero friction. Most people do not use products and services
    that frustrate them. No technology reaches the mainstream until it is guaranteed
    to be easy to use for almost anyone. In a world where cryptocurrency is widespread,
    your company can offer a customer faster and easier service. This new financial
    system competes with fiat currency. Governments can only benefit if they cannibalize
    their own fiat system. At the time of this writing, there are a dozen central
    banks who have plans to launch a ‘blockchain version’ of the national currency.
    In the opinion of many crypto enthusiasts that I have met, this scheme can not

    are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example, the monopoly on violence
    is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war, or by risk-takers with
    debatable ethics, also known as criminals. Likewise, Bitcoin challenges the government’s
    monopoly in the domain of money and finance. Any financial operator has the option
    to compete with the government and banks. Before Bitcoin, printing your own money
    was not done. Even if you did, you had to keep the scope limited, like with local
    currency or currency for use inside a multiplayer game. Ambitious attempts at
    money, such as e-gold, were futile because they could easily be stopped. However,
    Bitcoin could—and most likely can—not be stopped, so it is the first currency
    to have a chance to challenge the sovereignty of the state. It was naughty and
    edgy. It was a new way in which political minorities could exit the financial
    status quo.Up until 2019, Bitcoin was not subject to overt attempts to stop it.
    One reason is that most government officials and central bankers have not made
    up their minds about it. Even if they are vaguely against it, they do not know
    what they are looking at. This is obvious when you see a parliamentary committee
    investigate cryptocurrency by interviewing central bankers, cryptocurrency practitioners,
    and traditional finance types. Since late 2019 and in 2020, several U.S. politicians
    say they want cryptocurrencies outlawed because they undermine the interests of
    the U.S.A. They know what they are looking at: much of the geopolitical power
    of the U.S. comes from the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency. However,
    most politicians and central bankers do not understand the vision for cryptocurrency.
    They take their old yardstick for deciding whether it is money and see that cryptocurrency
    does not resemble fiat currency. They call it a digital commodity, or an entirely
    new asset class. Within the frame of their job, they are correct. It is indeed
    a new asset class because there is nothing else like it. It is also a commodity,
    undoubtedly similar to gold, and gold is serving as a mere commodity or as central
    bank assets. But in the past, gold was money. It started as a commodity, became
    money, and then went back to being a commodity for most people and only money-like
    for gold holders and central banks. Likewise, a scarce digital commodity can become
    money. It has all the necessary attributes to become money, plus a few extra ones,
    such as the ability to send it from one smartphone to another. Elite bankers and
    politicians tend to view the surface attributes of cryptocurrency correctly, but
    their frame is too narrow to see the big picture. Another possible reason that
    most governments do not try to stop Bitcoin could be to prevent a path of rebellion
    from crystallizing against their policies.A rebellion would empower the ecosystem
    and make it even more robust. It seems that most of the elite bankers and politicians
    fail to grasp cryptocurrency. It is nearly impossible to keep up with the developments
    in Bitcoin, other blockchains, and crypto-assets. Understanding how it works requires
    basic knowledge of a dozen branches of science. From there, you can dive into
    the details, which all come from specialized technical fields. A traditional politician,
    finance MBA, and even many conventional technology investors are not in a position
    to gauge cryptocurrencies accurately. They are too busy rendering crypto-assets
    through the lens of their own job, background, and responsibilities.What Cryptocurrency
    can BecomeAccording to some people, Bitcoin, and perhaps other blockchains, can
    secure all the value exchanges in the world. Any financial instrument that moves
    value around could become an automated contract on top of a decentralized digital
    currency. You can have multiple platforms on top of a cryptocurrency that keeps
    various types of arrangements secure, with different privacy and security features.
    Any ‘contract’ about a ‘financial product’ can then control a specific sum or
    flow of money. Those who want to deal with that kind of payment will be early
    adopters. As the demand for that money grows, more contracts and products become
    available. It becomes easy to water down the security for individual contracts
    and assets by having them run on an independent but smaller blockchain. The market
    will converge on the level of security and settlement assurances for each type
    of asset. Each product or service on top of a cryptocurrency will have to reach
    a balance between constraints. One way of defining these constraints is security
    , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010).
    These constraints form a triangle from which the designer picks two of the three
    for a given system. Each of these balanced security solutions has to be built
    by a company. Maybe that company could be founded by you.It seems that Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can already hold their own in parts of the economy.
    We can expect future functionality to absorb a broader range of transactions.
    We will depend less on institutions and will have less exposure to the arbitrary
    central planning of the money supply. Entrepreneurs will be free to create exactly
    the financial services that the global population demands, without having to jump
    through hoops set by regulators. Building on Bitcoin prevents dealings with people
    who must comply with regulations designed for a world in which the transport of
    value requires a third party. That freedom to disrupt global finance will meet
    resistance from the existing institutions because money is a piece of nation-state
    politics.While fiat currency requires the coercive power of a state, decentralized
    cryptocurrencies can resist that coercion while competing as a monetary good.
    This difference of political opinion between the mainstream and the creators of
    Bitcoin will shape the path of adoption for cryptocurrency because it unleashes
    open competition for monetary goods. Liquidity for crypto-assets weakens the monetary
    pillar of the government. Before Bitcoin was a monetary good, anarchists and libertarians
    only had debate and rhetoric as tools of persuasion. After Bitcoin, no more debate
    is necessary; they can act on their conviction by holding crypto-assets. They
    can exit the financial status quo. A pointless discussion between a minority and
    the mainstream has become a material contest, to be fought with disruptive money.
    Cryptocurrency opens the door to exit the fiat monetary system. Whoever takes
    that exit, stops supporting the political mainstream. With every holder of cryptocurrency,
    the anarchist and libertarian case gains strength. As the decentralized power
    of crypto-assets grows, fiat currency weakens. If that process continues, then
    at some point, the weaker authority will start to fail at regulation of the companies
    that build on top of cryptocurrencies. This could start a feedback loop of failing
    government and rising influence for the holders of crypto-assets.Governments,
    as sovereign entities, are not usually thought of as a competitor. For example,
    the monopoly on violence is only challenged by other nation-states by waging war,
