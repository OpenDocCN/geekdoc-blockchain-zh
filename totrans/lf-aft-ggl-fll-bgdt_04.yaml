- en: 'As Jerry Bowyer writes in Forbes, “If advertising dies [as support for media],
    then what we call media dies too. The whole system which started with newspapers,
    moved on to radio, then TV, and then various forms of blogging and streaming is
    basically the same business model: Gather a bunch of people together who think
    they’re there for one thing, but are really there for something else.”[¹](notes.html#ch04note-1)
    It’s a bait and switch, and no one likes it. Despite all its heroic advances,
    Google still gets no less than 95 percent of its revenue from ads tied to its
    search engine.'

  zh: 正如杰里·鲍耶在福布斯中写道，“如果广告（作为媒体的支持）消失了，那么我们称之为媒体的东西也会消失。整个系统始于报纸，然后转向广播，然后是电视，然后是各种形式的博客和流媒体，基本上是相同的商业模式：聚集一群认为自己在那里是为了一件事，但实际上是为了另一件事的人。”[¹](notes.html#ch04note-1)
    这是一种诱饵和转换，没有人喜欢它。尽管谷歌取得了许多英勇的进步，但仍然有至少95％的收入来自与其搜索引擎相关的广告。

    away for “free.” Sergey Brin asked the crucial question early in Google’s history:
    “How does the strategy change if the price is zero?”[²](notes.html#ch04note-2)
    The answer turned out to be: “We win the entire market.” In 2014, Google summoned
    Jeremy Rifkin to its lecture series to sum it all up. He heralded a “zero marginal
    cost society.” Under the new regime, the price of every incremental good and service,
    from search to software, from news to energy, will plunge toward “free” as every
    device and entity in the world is subsumed in an Internet of Things, where exponential
    network effects yield a new economy of leisure and abundance.[³](notes.html#ch04note-3)

    答案是：“我们赢得整个市场。” 2014年，谷歌邀请杰里米·里夫金参加其讲座系列，总结了一切。他预示了一个“零边际成本社会”。在新的体制下，从搜索到软件，从新闻到能源的每一种增量商品和服务的价格都会朝着“免费”暴跌，因为世界上的每个设备和实体都被纳入了物联网，指数级的网络效应产生了一个新的闲暇和丰富的经济。[³](notes.html#ch04note-3)
    里夫金向观众保证这确实是一个谷歌世界。
- en: But not only is “free” a lie, as we’ve seen, but a price of zero signifies a
    return to the barter system, a morass of incommensurable exchanges that the human
    race left behind in the Stone Age. You pay not with money but with your attention.

    media usage has doubled from five hours to ten hours per person. Free porn is
    both a vessel and a symbol of the addictive properties of free stuff. Meanwhile,
    ads delivered per person have remained stable at around 350 per day. Ads viewed
    per hour of media use, including print media, have dropped by half. In a world
    of digital devices, people are learning to cancel, mute, or avoid advertisements

- en: A blogger called Daniel Colin James came to my attention through a post on my
    Telecosm Lounge message board. Writing at a blog called Hacker Noon—“where hackers
    start their afternoons”[⁶](notes.html#ch04note-6)—James has cogently documented
    Google’s advertising vulnerabilities. His revelations begin with Apple’s decision
    late in 2015 to introduce an ad blocker in its iPhone. This was a major blow against
    the online strategy of “aggregate and advertise,” which was widely alleged to
    be Google’s path to permanent near-monopoly. Since the iPhone is the source of
    some 75 percent of all Google’s mobile ad revenues, Apple’s move struck at the
    heart of Google’s mobile strategy. Beyond its free, open source, “sharing-economy”
    Android platform, Google’s response did not arrive until a year later. Then it
    chose deceptively to copy Apple.

    Noon 的博客上撰写文章——“黑客们的下午起始之地”[⁶](notes.html#ch04note-6)——James 巧妙地记录了谷歌的广告漏洞。他的揭示始于苹果在
    2015 年底决定在 iPhone 上引入广告拦截器。这对于“聚合和广告”在线策略来说是一个重大打击，这种策略被普遍认为是谷歌通往永久近乎垄断的途径。由于
    iPhone 是谷歌移动广告收入的约 75％来源，苹果的举动直指谷歌的移动战略的要害。除了其免费、开源、共享经济的 Android 平台之外，谷歌的回应直到一年后才到来。然后它选择了欺骗性地模仿苹果。
- en: Google’s industry-leading advertising Analytics tools apparently revealed that
    its users liked the idea of blocking ads. Customers come first, so in its Chrome
    browser, Google introduced its own ad-blocker. Google’s angle was that its blocker
    would apply only to ads condemned by the Coalition for Better Ads. In other words,
    since Google’s ads were famously discreet and camouflaged, it announced it would
    block the ads of flagrant, garish, or slaphappy rivals. James speculates that
    this action might be illegal for a search engine.

  zh: 谷歌行业领先的广告分析工具显然显示，其用户喜欢屏蔽广告的想法。客户至上，因此在其 Chrome 浏览器中，谷歌引入了自己的广告拦截器。谷歌的角度是，其拦截器只会针对由“更好广告联盟”谴责的广告。换句话说，由于谷歌的广告以低调和伪装著称，它宣布将屏蔽那些过分、花哨或草率的竞争对手的广告。James
    推测这种行为可能违法，特别是对于搜索引擎来说。
- en: As James recognizes, for the online unwanted ads industry, ad-blocking is ultimately
    suicidal. Between 2015 and 2016, he reported, ad-blocking rose 102 percent, with
    16 percent of smartphone users globally using the technology. In the United States—the
    source of 47 percent of Google’s revenues—25 percent of desktop and laptop users
    were auto-deleting commercials. Leading this movement were youthful cohorts coveted
    by advertisers. As James notes with some relish, only 0.06 percent of smartphone
    ads were clicked through. Since more than 50 percent of the clicks were by mistake,
    according to the surveys, the intentional response rate was 0.03 percent.[⁷](notes.html#ch04note-7)
    Acceptable chiefly for spammers, this result cannot be part of Google’s plan.

    这个结果主要适用于垃圾邮件发送者，这不可能是谷歌计划的一部分。

    of “life after television” for $9.95 a month. I am an addict, and I wish that
    Google were adequately compensating its content suppliers. But it is not. The
    world’s largest streaming music site, with a 52 percent share, YouTube pays only
    13 percent of all music streaming royalties. Google faces intense competition
    from scores of vendors of streaming video for pay. In this field, Google is just
    another player, experiencing the slings and arrows of real price discovery.

- en: James’s second key point is that while pure info-search is still dominated by
    Google, commercial search—intentional searches for products to buy—is shifting
    dramatically to Amazon. By 2017, Amazon had 52 percent of the product-search market,
    and its gains were accelerating; Google languished at 26 percent. Viewers who
    wanted to buy something were beginning their searches with Amazon. The Seattle
    giant could actually sell it to them—with one click, no less—rather than leading
    them to the product with an ad followed by a rigmarole of passwords, user names,
    CAPTCHAs, EULAs, and credit card bumf. Amazon’s reviews, spurious though many
    presumably are, are simply more trusted than Google’s paid ads and intermediations.

  zh: 詹姆斯的第二个关键观点是，虽然纯信息搜索仍然由谷歌主导，但商业搜索——即有意购买产品的搜索——正在明显转向亚马逊。到2017年，亚马逊在产品搜索市场占据了52％的份额，其增长势头正在加速；而谷歌则停滞在26％。想要购买东西的观众开始他们的搜索从亚马逊开始。这家西雅图巨头实际上可以通过一次点击就将产品卖给他们，而不是通过广告引导他们，然后是一系列繁琐的密码、用户名、验证码、最终用户许可协议和信用卡信息。亚马逊的评论，尽管许多评论可能是虚假的，但比起谷歌的付费广告和中介来说，更受信任。为什么不呢？

    had applied its AI tools to the unseen back end, where it targeted ads and analyzed
    responses to them. It took a full two years to respond with household devices
    that copied Amazon’s. But there was a deeper problem. Both Google’s mobile-first
    strategy and Amazon’s Alexa turned the industry toward voice-accessed AI. Voice
    access largely nullifies Google’s search-ad dominance. Barking voice ads into
    a search stream differs radically from inserting decorous text amid thousands
    of responses to a textual search request. This was a retrograde strategy harking
    back to the world of radio in its death spiral. Here more and more ads were needed
