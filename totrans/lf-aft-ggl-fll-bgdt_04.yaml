    in a slow but discernible death spiral.

    then what we call media dies too. The whole system which started with newspapers,
    moved on to radio, then TV, and then various forms of blogging and streaming is
    basically the same business model: Gather a bunch of people together who think
    they’re there for one thing, but are really there for something else.”[¹](notes.html#ch04note-1)
    It’s a bait and switch, and no one likes it. Despite all its heroic advances,
    Google still gets no less than 95 percent of its revenue from ads tied to its
    search engine.'

    away for “free.” Sergey Brin asked the crucial question early in Google’s history:
    “How does the strategy change if the price is zero?”[²](notes.html#ch04note-2)
    The answer turned out to be: “We win the entire market.” In 2014, Google summoned
    Jeremy Rifkin to its lecture series to sum it all up. He heralded a “zero marginal
    cost society.” Under the new regime, the price of every incremental good and service,
    from search to software, from news to energy, will plunge toward “free” as every
    device and entity in the world is subsumed in an Internet of Things, where exponential
    network effects yield a new economy of leisure and abundance.[³](notes.html#ch04note-3)
    Rifkin assured his audience that it is indeed a Google world.'

    He may well have succeeded by now, save for the occasional subpoena from an officious
    regulator somewhere. But for the rest of us, all the free stuff leads to transactional

    quoted by Needham & Company’s Laura Martin, over the past seventy years daily
    media usage has doubled from five hours to ten hours per person. Free porn is
    both a vessel and a symbol of the addictive properties of free stuff. Meanwhile,
    ads delivered per person have remained stable at around 350 per day. Ads viewed
    per hour of media use, including print media, have dropped by half. In a world
    of digital devices, people are learning to cancel, mute, or avoid advertisements
    that they do not want to see. As soon as the next generation of innovators creates
    a new payment and security model, this trend will accelerate.

    “free” goods, Jonathan Taplin revealed in Move Fast and Break Things that Google

    intermediator. Although Google’s list of business principles leads off with “The
    customer comes first,” Google has few end customers at all. Beyond the coddled
    purchasers of its ads, Google’s customer base is tiny compared with Amazon’s,
    which unlike Google was never shy about collecting money.

    Telecosm Lounge message board. Writing at a blog called Hacker Noon—“where hackers
    start their afternoons”[⁶](notes.html#ch04note-6)—James has cogently documented
    Google’s advertising vulnerabilities. His revelations begin with Apple’s decision
    late in 2015 to introduce an ad blocker in its iPhone. This was a major blow against
    the online strategy of “aggregate and advertise,” which was widely alleged to
    be Google’s path to permanent near-monopoly. Since the iPhone is the source of
    some 75 percent of all Google’s mobile ad revenues, Apple’s move struck at the
    heart of Google’s mobile strategy. Beyond its free, open source, “sharing-economy”
    Android platform, Google’s response did not arrive until a year later. Then it
    chose deceptively to copy Apple.

- en: Google’s industry-leading advertising Analytics tools apparently revealed that
    its users liked the idea of blocking ads. Customers come first, so in its Chrome
    browser, Google introduced its own ad-blocker. Google’s angle was that its blocker
    would apply only to ads condemned by the Coalition for Better Ads. In other words,
    since Google’s ads were famously discreet and camouflaged, it announced it would
    block the ads of flagrant, garish, or slaphappy rivals. James speculates that
    this action might be illegal for a search engine.

- en: As James recognizes, for the online unwanted ads industry, ad-blocking is ultimately
    suicidal. Between 2015 and 2016, he reported, ad-blocking rose 102 percent, with
    16 percent of smartphone users globally using the technology. In the United States—the
    source of 47 percent of Google’s revenues—25 percent of desktop and laptop users
    were auto-deleting commercials. Leading this movement were youthful cohorts coveted
    by advertisers. As James notes with some relish, only 0.06 percent of smartphone
    ads were clicked through. Since more than 50 percent of the clicks were by mistake,
    according to the surveys, the intentional response rate was 0.03 percent.[⁷](notes.html#ch04note-7)
    Acceptable chiefly for spammers, this result cannot be part of Google’s plan.

    was offering its YouTube users a taste of ad-free nirvana, dubbed YouTubeRed.
    A devout YouTubeRed user, I can attest that it is a revel—a truly lavish offering
    of “life after television” for $9.95 a month. I am an addict, and I wish that
    Google were adequately compensating its content suppliers. But it is not. The
    world’s largest streaming music site, with a 52 percent share, YouTube pays only
    13 percent of all music streaming royalties. Google faces intense competition
    from scores of vendors of streaming video for pay. In this field, Google is just
    another player, experiencing the slings and arrows of real price discovery.

- en: James’s second key point is that while pure info-search is still dominated by
    Google, commercial search—intentional searches for products to buy—is shifting
    dramatically to Amazon. By 2017, Amazon had 52 percent of the product-search market,
    and its gains were accelerating; Google languished at 26 percent. Viewers who
    wanted to buy something were beginning their searches with Amazon. The Seattle
    giant could actually sell it to them—with one click, no less—rather than leading
    them to the product with an ad followed by a rigmarole of passwords, user names,
    CAPTCHAs, EULAs, and credit card bumf. Amazon’s reviews, spurious though many
    presumably are, are simply more trusted than Google’s paid ads and intermediations.
    Why not?

    measures commanded the world’s leading cloud deployment, somehow Amazon defeated
    them in marketing cloud services by 57 percent to 16 percent as of 2017\. This
    advance in collecting money from real customers must have been baffling to Google.
    It fought back, as it normally does, with a stream of YouTube speeches and technical
    presentations demonstrating the superiority of Google’s cloud offerings, its global
    SQL reach, its facile user interfaces, its instant responses, its MapReduce, Hadoop,
    and “Spanner” big-database schemes, its massive fiber deployments and world-spanning
    data centers, its idealism, its tech conference éclat. But somehow when people
    had to choose a cloud service, they were turning not to Google but to Amazon Web
    Services. Who would have thunk it?

    publicized “mobile first” mantra, which had led to its acquisitions of Android
    and Ad Mob, and toward “AI first.” Google was the recognized intellectual leader
    of the industry, and its AI ostentation was widely acclaimed. Indeed it signed
    up most of the world’s AI celebrities, including its spearheads of “deep learning”
    prowess, from Geoffrey Hinton and Andrew Ng to Jeff Dean, the beleaguered Anthony
    Levandowski, and Demis Hassabis of DeepMind.

    AI talent. It must have been discouraging, then, to find that Amazon had shrewdly
    captured much of the market for AI services with its 2014 Alexa and Echo projects.
    It launched actual hardware to bring AI to everyone’s household in the form of
    elegantly designed devices that answered questions and ordered products while
    eschewing ads.

    had applied its AI tools to the unseen back end, where it targeted ads and analyzed
    responses to them. It took a full two years to respond with household devices
    that copied Amazon’s. But there was a deeper problem. Both Google’s mobile-first
    strategy and Amazon’s Alexa turned the industry toward voice-accessed AI. Voice
    access largely nullifies Google’s search-ad dominance. Barking voice ads into
    a search stream differs radically from inserting decorous text amid thousands
    of responses to a textual search request. This was a retrograde strategy harking
    back to the world of radio in its death spiral. Here more and more ads were needed
    to prop up a dwindling supply of content, and the chief winners were charismatic
    un-Googly talkers, such as Rush Limbaugh.

    Google will know. It hopes to use these data to enrich its advertising systems
    and escape the problems of voice ads in the Google Assistant stream. But if people
    don’t want ads in their search results, YouTube videos, and news streams, they
    won’t want them in their dishwashers either.

    real customers. It is escape from the challenges of security. Who wants to steal
    free goods? If the vast bulk of your product line is free, you avoid many of the
    real time demands of preventing hacks and thefts. You rarely have to establish
    a ground state and defend it. Indeed, in a stream of free goods, the chief hacker
    is Google and its insidious ad-insert hocus pocus. Google can post cavalier assurances
    on its websites that place the burden of security on the customers. “If you see
    something say something,” implies Google, echoing the TSA’s feel-good strategy,
    chiefly designed to shift the responsibility to the “customers.”

    For every other player on the Net, the lack of security is the most relevant threat

    you’ve never heard of are investing billions right now in that effort. Collectively
    they will give birth to a new network whose most powerful architectural imperative
    will be security of transactions as a property of the system rather than an afterthought.
    So fundamental will security be to this new system that its very name will be
    derived from it. It will be the cryptocosm.
