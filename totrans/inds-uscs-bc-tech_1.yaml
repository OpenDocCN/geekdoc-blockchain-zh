- en: The editor acknowledges the support and efforts of a number of colleagues. First
    and foremost, I would like to thank the contributors to this book, 31 authors
    and co-authors from academia as well as industry from around the world who collectively
    developed and submitted a total of 14 chapters. Without their efforts in developing
    quality chapters conforming to the required guidelines and meeting often the strict
    deadlines, this text would not have been possible. Their names and brief biographical
    notes are listed in a separate section in this book.

    board of this book who willingly volunteered their time in reviewing the book
    chapters and providing further advisory and editorial support. Their names and
    affiliations also appear in a separate section in this book.

    Imran, Hanya, Arif and Ozair - for their continued support, love, and encouragement.
    Every good wish, also, for the youngest and the most delightful in our family:
