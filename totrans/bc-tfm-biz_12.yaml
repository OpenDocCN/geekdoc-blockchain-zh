- en: Big data:  a term that describes the large volume of data—both structured and
    unstructured—that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. These datasets are
    so voluminous and complex that traditional data-processing application software
    is inadequate to deal with them.

- en: Bitcoin:  an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. It is a type
    of cryptocurrency. It is the first decentralised digital currency, because the
    system works without a central bank or single administrator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain:  a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another
    cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically. The cryptography underlying blockchain
    ensures a ‘trustless’ system, thereby removing the need for intermediaries to
    manage risk, making data on a blockchain immutable, traceable, and verifiable.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Consensus mechanism:  a feature in decentralised networks to determine the
    preferences of the individual users (or nodes) and to manage decision-making of
    the whole network. The key to any blockchain: with a consensus algorithm, there
    is no longer the need for a trusted third party and, as a result, decisions can
    be created, implemented, and evaluated, without the need for a central authority.'

- en: Cryptocurrency:  a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that
    uses cryptography to secure its transactions, control the creation of additional
    units, and verify the transfer of assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cryptocurrency mining:  a race that rewards computer nodes for being first to
    solve cryptographic puzzles on public blockchain networks. By solving the puzzle,
    the miner verifies the block and creates a hash pointer to the next block. Once
    verified, each block in the chain becomes immutable.

- en: Cryptography:  protects data from theft or alteration, and can also be used
    for user authentication. Earlier cryptography was effectively synonymous with
    encryption but nowadays cryptography is mainly based on mathematical theory and
    computer science practice.

- en: Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO):  an organisation that is run through
    rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. A DAO’s financial transaction
    record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain. It is an organisation
    without management or employees, run completely by autonomous code.

- en: Decentralised networks:  a computing environment in which multiple parties (or
    nodes) make their own independent decisions. In such a system, there is no single
    centralised authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties.

- en: Digital signatures:  a digital code (generated and authenticated by public key
    encryption) that is attached to an electronically transmitted document to verify
    its contents and the sender’s identity. Digital signatures are based on public
    key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography.

- en: 'Distributed application (DApp):  blockchain-enabled products and services are
    commonly referred to as decentralised applications, or DApps. A DApp has at least
    two distinctive features: (1) any changes to the protocol of the DApp have to
    be approved by consensus; and (2) the application has to use a cryptographic token,
    or cryptocurrency, which is generated according to a set algorithm. Bitcoin is
    probably the best-known DApp.'

- en: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):  a digital system for recording the transaction
    of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple
    places at the same time. A blockchain is a distributed ledger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Distributed networks:  distributed networking is a distributed computing network
    system, said to be distributed when the computer programming and the data to be
    worked on are spread out across more than one computer. Usually, this is implemented
    over a computer network. Participants in a distributed network are able to verify
    and authenticate other users’ transactions and exchanges. For this reason, the
    community values its own worth and reputation.

- en: Double-spending problem:  this arises when a given set of crypto-tokens is spent
    in more than one transaction. By solving the double-spending problem, digital
    or cryptocurrency has now become viable.

    are safe and humane, and that consumers can be guaranteed of the origins and quality
    of the products they consume.

- en: Hash Algorithm:  each block of data on a blockchain receives a hash ID, as a
    database key, calculated by a Secure Hash Algorithm. This block hash is fixed.
    In other words, the hash ID allocated to the block never changes. Hash Algorithms
    are used in a variety of components of blockchain technology, one of them being
    the hash ID, which is a unique string of 64 numbers and letters linked to data
    in each block.

- en: Hash Function:  this is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary
    size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a Hash Function are called
    hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.

- en: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT):  a process that relies on the sheer
    number of nodes in order to confirm trust. Assuming that a malicious attach on
    the network will occur, the PBFT provides a level of assurance and trust that
    would not otherwise be achievable.

- en: Proof of Stake (PoS):  a way of validating transactions and achieving a distributed
    consensus. It is an algorithm and its purpose is to incentivise nodes to confirm
    transactions. PoS uses someone’s stake in a cryptocurrency to ensure good behaviour.

- en: Self-sovereign identity:  the concept that people and businesses can store their
    own identity data on their own devices, and provide it efficiently on request.
    The key benefits of self-sovereign identity are the user only provides the information
    that is needed by the provider and the provider only receives and stores essential
    information (and with the identity-owner’s express permission).

- en: Smart contracts:  programmable applications that can be automated to initiate
    on satisfaction of certain conditions. These conditions can include complex conditional
    logic. The smart contract verifies that parties to a transaction can meet their
    promises, and then the technology manages the exchange so that each promise is
    satisfied simultaneously, almost certainly eliminating risk for all parties to
    the transaction.
