- en: The development of nourishment and food is an essential requirement of nations
    for their affluence and welfare. Agriculture is the science and specialty of developing
    plants and livestock. In sedentary human civilization, agriculture plays a key
    role. The agribusiness needs to do a ton of work to keep up and fabricate the
    purchaser’s trust with regards to the food quality check. A blockchain-based agricultural
    arrangement holds a guarantee for the agro-business with its capacity to acquire
    clarity and transparency in the framework. Minimal effort agrarian protection
    plans are progressively seen as instruments for giving social assurance to the
    individuals influenced by floods or dry seasons. In assisting with the diminishing
    effects, they endure because of such occasions. Therefore, this chapter introduces
    the idea of blockchain technology, extensive literature survey, including a review
    of blockchain development in the nourishment sector followed by the cases in the
    food supply chain. This chapter presented various opportunities and an ideal architecture
    of how blockchain will function in the farming sector. Finally, the chapter concludes
    by featuring open research difficulties in this field.

    The innovations in the field of blockchain are surely transforming numerous industries
    from banking to the healthcare sector and also the real estate business. Now research
    works are going on to implement the same in the agricultural sector. With the
    advancement in IoT applications, the technological domain, as well as financial
    sectors have acquired substantial growth in ecological observing applications
    to assess the quality of water, soil, and air. The world population is calculated
    to be 7.8 billion as of April 2020\. With the continuous increase in population,
    there is a drastic increase in the demand for per-capita food.

- en: Studies in 2014-15 showed that an adult has a 6.1 percent more calorie urge
    as compared to that of an adult in 1975-76\. Increasing demand for food has remarkably
    affected the environment, which as a result has endangered many species. The destruction
    caused to the environment due to high food demand is in the form of deforestation,
    increased levels of carbon emission, *etc*. If the food supply chain is efficiently
    organized then there is a potential of reducing carbon footprint and environmental
    hazards which in turn will guarantee food safety [[1](#r1)]. In the current food
    supply chain, there are several stakeholders involved from production to consumption,
    making the situation difficult to retrieve actual step-by-step data for analysis.
    It is presented in the reports that in agricultural farming activities, a significant
    amount of carbon is produced in various processes. In the United States, it is
    estimated that among all the factors responsible for the generation of greenhouse
    gases, only transportation of food contributes 11% to the emission. It is observed
    that food production must be doubled by 2050 to meet the nutrients requirement
    of every individual [[2](#r2)].

    want to know detailed information about their eatables and others. People show
    very little reliance on the existing food system. Blockchain has provided exciting
    solutions for these problems. It provides eternal evidence for each proceeding
    part which is then arranged into various blocks and no changes can be reflected
    there. It also helps in replacing those physical trackers and monitoring entities
    to prevent the imprecise impact of the traditional supply chain [[3](#r3)]. Tracking
    of the supply chain is the most important measure to protect the safety of eatables,
    securing them from malign vulnerabilities and encouraging food certification.
    LetsFarm is a start-up utilizing computerized reasoning with AI to enable ranchers
    over the globe. It utilizes transparent instruments and advancements to associate
    farmers so they can get the data they need from any place. Appropriate data can
    assist farmers with increasing their yield and to have a better salary from similar
    harvests that they are developing. LetsFarm likewise engages farmers with auxiliary
    salary by giving crucial data and expanding the pay of farmer’s family units.
    After all, the overall growth of ranchers is the progress of the country all in
    all!. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature, and Food Quality financed the
    main research venture, “Blockchain for Agri-food” which has been proposed to investigate
    blockchain suggestions for Agri-food. Pilot research shows that blockchain innovation
    empowered nourishment to be followed from farm to market in only a couple of seconds
    [[4](#r4)]. Blockchain additionally assists with watching bottomless items and
    diminish instances of illicit gathering and delivery cheats. The United Nations
    uncovers that nourishment fakes cost the worldwide economy around $40 billion
    every year because of unlawful exchanges. A ton of advancements originated from
    new businesses and the rural division isn't a special case. Ripe.io and Pavo Coin
    are two ongoing business models that use blockchain in the supply chain [[5](#r5)].

    and offers clients an elevated level of straightforwardness. The framework created
    by Ripo.io can distinguish mugginess, readiness, and the temperature of the item.
    In this way, the rancher gets the data about the states of things. Blockchain
    achieving decentralization is not entirely technical in nature rather it’s a combination
    of technical and smart engineering incentives. It began in 2008 with Satoshi Nakamoto,
    whose real identity is still not known to anyone, released a white paper that
    introduced a purely peer-to-peer version of crypto cash called bitcoin. There
    are four types of blockchain named as a private blockchain, public blockchain,
    federated blockchain, and the last one being hybrid. In private blockchain access
    is controlled, only a few users have the permission to view and verify the transaction.
    It is used in services where data security is a prime concern [[6](#r6)]. A public
    blockchain is one that has open access to all though transactions are anonymous.
    Transactions are transparent to those who have view access in the ledger. Federated
    blockchain is operated by a group or federation and only the members of the group
    have access. Hybrid refers to the system which uses public blockchain but also
    hosts private blockchain. Though data is stored on a public blockchain yet data
    privacy is not intruded. There is an incentive that is provided to the nodes for
    behaving honestly. There are two incentive mechanisms in the bitcoin named block
    reward and the other is transaction payment. In the service of creating a block
    in the blockchain, initially, the creator of the block includes the generation
    of special coin transactions in the block and then chooses the receiver address
    of this agreement. Block maker gets to the opportunity to gather the reward only
    if the block terminates up on long-term consensus branch. In the blockchain, the
    worth of block reward gets halved after every four years. Block reward is how
    new bitcoins are made and it is assessed that it will run out in 2140\. There
    will be no new bitcoins if this standard remains unchanged. In transaction fees,
    the procedure creator of the transaction can decide to make the yield estimation
    of coin lesser than input esteem, and the rest of the amount will be the transaction
    expense to the creator of the block which is placed on the consensus branch [[7](#r7)].
    There are many problems associated with these methods such as how to pick a random
    junction for each transaction or how to keep away every node from running the
    bitcoin node for collecting the reward. To improve upon this now bitcoins are
    generated by the process of consensus mechanism which includes various processes
    such as PoW, PoS, DPoS, and PBFT. In the Proof of Work (PoW) process, a bitcoin
    miner who finds the hash value first will be permitted to include another new
    block of exchange to the blockchain. In the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, the
    more coins the stakeholder has, it is more likely that they will include a new
    block of exchange to the blockchain. In Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), coin
    holders can utilize their balance to choose a list of modes to be possibly permitted
    to add new transaction blocks to the blockchain. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (PBFT) relies on no. of nodes to affirm trust. When enough feedbacks are obtained
    which in general is 51%, the transaction is declared as a valid transaction. There
    are mainly two important terminologies in the blockchain named as a consensus
    mechanism and smart contracts which need to be understood before studying the
    utility of it in the agricultural domain. Consensus Mechanism is a way to guarantee
    a mutual agreement on a data point. Each vertex in the system grid has a duplicate
    of a similar record(ledger). It is secured in nature and an economic framework
    of the cryptographic protocol. Objectives of a consensus mechanism include agreement
    seeking, collaboration, cooperation, inclusive property, and participation. There
    are three basic steps of consensus, the first one being endorsement which determines
    whether to accept a transaction or not. Then comes ordering, which sorts all the
    transactions into a series in a specified period. The last one is the validation
    which verifies the endorsement policy. Smart contracts, also known as a self-executing
    contract, is a computer convention that digitally facilitates, checks, or upholds
    the presentation of an agreement by avoiding middlemen interaction and validates
    it over a decentralized platform by all peers who stores the blockchain. It is
    used for the exchange of money, shares, *etc*. It is self-verifying, self-executing
    in nature, and has resistance to any change. It turns legal obligations into automated
    processes. It is cheaper as there are no third-party fees involved. It guarantees
    a greater degree of security.

- en: In a traditional system, the seed company produces the seed which is identified
    according to global standards and updates the local record. The farmer buys the
    seed, harvests the crops, and sends it to the grain elevator which stores the
    produced crop in various warehouses. Various grain processors buy the grains from
    warehouses and refine them to make the end product. Then distributors take those
    end products and sell them to retailers who further sell the product in small
    identifiable quantities to the customer [[8](#r8)]. Agriculture in India can be
    categorized into various phases such as production, supply chain, processing,
    and marketing. Fig. ([**1**](#f1)) represents the various phases in the chain
    that lead to credit risk and limit the flow of credit due to poor supply of inputs
    and outdated farming policies in the production phase, high wastage, and poor
    transportation facility along with many intermediaries in supplying phase.

    change any record subtly like date, and substance which will stay unaltered. A
    single scanning of a QR code will give a shopper all data about nourishment –*i.e.*
    which type of seeds are used for the production purpose, what pesticides are used
    in the process, how much time it is put in the shop *etc*. Similarly, it can be
    used for poultry purposes to know the exact time, what conditions it lived in,

    production purposes. Among all sectors, the primary sector of India contributes
    significantly to the economy though it is decreased down to 15% due to the continuous
    evolvement of industries and other commercial sectors. Fig. ([**2**](#f2)) shows
    the division of available land in India. India is the second biggest natural product

    There are some regular issues in nourishment supply networks, for example, food
    quality and security, food tracing, nourishment trust, and inefficiency of the
    store network, which includes extra danger to the whole economy, society, and
    human health. From the makers' point of view, the utilization of blockchain innovation
    sets up a trusted association with customers and develop the notoriety of their
    items, by clearly giving data of individual item in the blockchain [[35](#r35)].
    This would make it hard for providers of misrepresentation and low-quality items
    to remain in business sectors and enforces all providers to improve the nature
    of their products in the entire farming and nourishment parts. Undertakings can
    accomplish the estimation of their items and in this manner increment their competition
    in the market. It helps to address the purchasers' anxiety about the quality,
    security, and ecological accessibility of nourishment. The utilization of blockchain
    makes it possible for the producers and purchasers to associate with each other
    since customers can comprehend the nourishment creation process easily and in
    a more characteristic way. The current blockchain innovation in the food store
    network is still in the beginning phase of improvement. All stakeholders, including
    makers, purchasers, and government administrative bodies, would thus be able to
    be profited [[36](#r36)]. For instance, the DNA of domesticated animals, pesticide
    build-ups of vegetables, or grain can be checked and confirmed by any stakeholder
    engagement with the supply network of the item. In the current time, the gathering
    of such information for all items can lead to higher costs, yet for the testing
    phase, it tends to be done on the sample test. Alibaba, JD.com, and Wal-Mart are
    effectively executing blockchain detectability ventures and utilizing it to follow

    most vital difficulties looked at by internet business organizations, particularly
    in developing nations like India. But this difficulty is not creating hindrances
    anymore due to the setups of e-commerce organizations like Grofers, big basket,
    *etc*. Moreover, internet business retailers likewise need to deal with small
    orders including various diversified items that require more time which causes
    high working expenses for web-based business organizations. A business venture
    of Hubei locality in India, Old Farmers' Shopping Mall which is a web-based business
    organization, can be followed back to the source and all the creation data is
    a questionable asset by customers. Before the products are placed in the stores,
    various detailed data such as seed sowing, irrigation information, preparation,
    and fertilizing are recorded. They additionally give fundamental information on
    makers, transportation coordinators, stockpiling days, and stock-keeping temperature
    [[37](#r37)]. Clients just need to filter the QR code on the products and all
    the data will be accessible to them. This strategy can successfully keep away
    from the phony of illicit traders, middlemen, and remake customer’s trust in farm
    items from online businesses and their providers. Blockchain innovation may give
    appropriate answers for some parts of these issues such as data security. It gives
    private key encryption which is an incredible asset that gives the confirmation
    prerequisites. It would thus be able to connect the information of all parts of
    sowing and collection of rural items securely and unchangeably. The blockchain
    furnishes a computerized payment arrangement with zero rates. Besides, the utilization
    of digital currency in the exchange of agricultural items will lessen exchange
    costs more significantly. It also reduces the expenses of cultivators. Numerous
    rural items are delivered by family units but due to the low exchange volume and
    little scope, customary internet businesses are not willing to offer assistance
    for them, accordingly barring these members from the market. Blockchain can significantly
    lessen exchange costs and consolidate them into the market once more.

    fees before the crop season starts and get protection pay if they experience a
    misfortune on their farmland. In this way, the safety net provider bears all the
    safeguarded hazards and cultivators can deal with their budgetary presentations
    to climatic conditions. Besides, complete insurance inclusion with no deducible
    amounts is conceivable and installments can be made convenient and automated soon
    after an unfavorable climate occasion is estimated. Errors among pay-out and on-farm
    misfortune can happen which is indicated as premise chance. Three sources of premise
    hazard can happen named spatial premise hazard, temporal basis hazard, and plan
    premised hazard. The spatial premise hazard denotes any contrasts among estimated
    and the on-farm climate through spatial separation technique. Temporal or fleeting
    premise hazard defines that an uncertain time window is picked for list assurance
    as depicted that instead of evaluating developing season precipitation procedure

    but in some cases, they are inclined to issues emerging from deviated data issues.
    Ranchers are needed to be better educated about both unfavorable choices and moralized
    hazard issues. A Swiss-based organization Etherisc gives decentralized harvest
    protection dependent on blockchain innovation that gives pay-outs dependent on

    utilization of an Ethereum blockchain-based keen agreement in which pay-outs would
    be made in the digitalized currency Ether. Another brilliant harvest protection
    supplier is Arbol where a rancher can suggest an agreement that incorporates the

    The various stages of agriculture include soil and crop monitoring, storage, and
    distribution system of eatables and marketing as shown in Fig. ([**5**](#f5)).
    A lot of data is required to be collected to maintain the quality of the supply
    chain and to establish the faith of customers in blockchain technology. In the
    soil monitoring system, data such as pH, temperature, and amount of other minerals
    of soil should be stored. The number of pesticides, fertilizers used and the water
    used for the irrigation purpose needs to be stored which is now possible using
    the sensors such as IoT devices. Various weather controls need to be noted down
    such as wind speed, moisture content, barometric pressure, precipitation, ultraviolet
    radiation, *etc*. In terms of storage and distribution of entities data such as
    quality control labels, transportation information using sensors, and data related
    to the security of food during the inspection of warehouses need to be entered
    [[41](#r41)]. In the marketing procedure, the bill of the data including the taxes
