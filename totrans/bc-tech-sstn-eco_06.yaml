- en: Today blockchain technology provides us with a formidable tool in the struggle
    to trace economic resources, especially in the context of the circular economy.
    The circular economy has been proposed as a key element in the transformation
    of production models in the context of European post–covid-19 recovery plans with
    particular reference to the Next Generation EU instrument. It is also a fundamental
    part of the European Green Deal. All of which comes under the umbrella of the
    United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda. The circular
    economy lays the foundations for the promotion of a new production and consumption
    model in which the value of products, materials, and resources remains within
    the economy for as long as possible, minimizing the generation of waste. This
    gives rise to a series of processes in which resource traceability is a key factor
    in preserving process integrity and guaranteeing process authenticity to the State,
    citizens, and companies. In this context, blockchain technology can provide solutions
    that are aligned with the 2030 Agenda. This technology facilitates the procedures
    and processes of logistics and of IoT sensor records via smart contracts through
    intrinsic properties that include timeproof sealing and data record immutability.
    In the present chapter, we describe the technological advantages that blockchain
    technology offers the circular economy. Sustainability is the cornerstone of blockchain
    models within the framework of the 2030 Agenda, so energy pollution in transactions
    or mining should be avoided. If we are able to overcome current environmental
    deterrents, distributed ledger technologies should represent a powerful tool in
    circular economy projects. In this chapter, we would hope to contribute to the
    debate on future paths towards sustainability. Specifically, we will describe
    how Blockchain as a Service-based traceability platform could be introduced into
    the circular economy while guaranteeing their straightforward but highly effective
    deployment in, for instance, the agrifood sector, at only minimal cost to SMEs.
    The underlying idea is based on finding blockchain solutions aligned with Sustainable
    Development Goals in order to ensure that the principal objectives and philosophy
    of the circular economy are upheld.

    at the forefront, provides an opportunity to establish a new framework for processes
    in circular economy (CE) projects. This chapter offers both an overview of the
    CE as a concept and of the challenges it faces, and a novel solution to the issue
    of traceability within the CE by using a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) model
    that relies on a cutting-edge DLT which, unlike classic blockchain and Ethereum
    approaches, guarantees sustainability. A key concept of our model is that of token
    and “tokenization” which, beyond the use of technology as a support for cryptocurrencies,
    facilitates digitizing and operating with any other type of asset.

    Network (NDL)-based solution that overcomes the disadvantages of blockchain and
    Ethereum—in terms of sustainability due to their high energy consumption—and offers
    additional advantages. Finally, in Sect. [4](#Sec12), we conclude by reflecting
    on the implications and future challenges represented by the employment of DLTs
    specifically, and of emerging digital technologies in general, in order to improve
    CE models and fulfill the 2030 Agenda.

    toxicity, or loss of biodiversity are widely used to describe part of the reality
    with which *Homo sapiens* engages. This reality is based on what is called a linear
    economy or a traditional economy model and is characterized by extracting, transforming,
    and generating waste—as such it has made itself unsustainable [[13](#CR13), [33](#CR33)].
    The inefficiency of the linear model is mainly due to the negative externalities
    it generates—destabilizing and endangering the economic, environmental, and social
    sustainability of our ecosystems—and how they affect natural ecosystems [[10](#CR10)–[12](#CR12),
    [14](#CR14), [38](#CR38), [45](#CR45), [50](#CR50)]. All this is a challenge to
    the survival of organizations, the global economy, and, indeed, the planet itself—as
    is reflected in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Consequently, we
    need to respond to this inefficiency and move towards a new paradigm that is based
    on sustainable sociotechnical systems [[24](#CR24), [42](#CR42)].

    the paradigm are deep-rooted and did not come into being on a specific date or
    through a specific author. As early as 1965, Kenneth E. Boulding pointed out that
    humanity had for centuries thought that resources were unlimited. In the context
    of a sparsely populated planet, this was quite conceivably the case. However,
    the evolution of the Earth's population has converted ours into a finite, limited,
    crowded planet. That is why Boulding proposed we think of the earth as if it were
    a spaceship, from which we cannot throw out waste. He introduced the idea of “stable
    circular flow”, necessary for the medium-term survival of the planet.

    European Commission, Stahel and Reday-Mulvey [[44](#CR44)] introduced the idea
    of substituting the use of energy for that of labor. We should recall that in
    the 1970s energy prices soared and unemployment levels grew significantly. In
    their report, the authors argued that more manpower and fewer resources were needed
    to renovate existing buildings rather than erect new ones. They included the vision
    of an economy in cycles or loops (a circular economy) that, in addition to having
    a positive impact on job creation and economic competitiveness, would save resources
    and reduce waste generation. These principles were valid for any stock or capital,
    from mobile phones to arable land or our cultural heritage. Stahel is credited
    with having invented the expression “[from] Cradle to Cradle” (C2C). This links
    with the idea of regenerative design, which developed from the principles of agriculture
    and was initially applied to architecture. This idea of regeneration is one of
    the foundations of the CE framework, developed thanks to Lyle, McDonough, Braungart,
    and Stahel. As early as 1980, CE as a term was used to describe a system of interaction
    between the economy and the environment [[39](#CR39)] (Fig. [1](#Fig1)).![../images/520662_1_En_6_Chapter/520662_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_6_Chapter/520662_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png)

    flow’ of industrial materials. Product components can be designed for continuous
    recovery and reuse as biological and technical nutrients in these metabolisms.
    The C2C framework eliminates the traditional concept of waste since waste equates
    with nutrients. In addition, systems that collect and recover the value of these
    materials after their use need to be created and used. The need to control energy
    and water input is also addressed. One of the key principles of the CE foregrounds
    energy: only renewable energy sources should be used and networks should be decentralized.

    interacts with its environment creating an ecosystem in which, according to systems
    theory, the parts and whole are interdependent. Interactions occurring within
    this ecosystem are guided by physical, biological, and social laws and continually
    draw matter and energy from the ecosystem. Secondly, nutritional, physical, biological,
    economic, and psychosocial maintenance functions are performed within this ecosystem.
    Hence, the theory holds immense value when examining these functions at different
    levels and their interrelationships over time. Thirdly, industry and resources
    are interdependent. Therefore, ecological wealth depends on the decisions and
    actions of countries and industries. The welfare of a given industry cannot be
    separated from the welfare of the entire ecosystem [[6](#CR6)]. So, we must establish
    a balance between the demands of the ecosystem and those of individuals.

    the official manifesto says, “using the resources available in cascade systems,
    (…) the waste of a product becomes the input to create a new cash flow.” The main
    idea is to copy the behavior of natural ecosystems in the way that they consume
    local products and do not generate waste. For Pauli, all waste generated should
    be reintroduced into the production process as new raw materials, exactly as happens
    in Nature. The use of waste for other processes would also benefit the economy
    by generating new jobs.

    by design [[23](#CR23), [25](#CR25)]. It is designed to depend on renewable energy,
    minimizing the use of fossil fuels. In general, it eliminates or mitigates the
    use of toxic chemicals and waste through a design that stipulates minimal resource
    use in manufacturing and a reduction in the production-energy balance, water footprint,
    and carbon footprint. A company can be considered to produce according to the
    CE paradigm when its process is regenerative with respect to input and it has
    a low environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint.
    Production under the CE paradigm seeks to optimize the process and minimize the
    negative externalities generated [[27](#CR27), [34](#CR34)]. These concepts are

    that can be renewed without a human process. Biological nutrients are recycled
    through biochemical processes such as conversion into biomass, anaerobic digestion,
    in which organic matter kills microorganisms and produces biogas; and composting,

    to economic, environmental, and/or social sustainability for third parties and
    for society in general. Laczniak [[22](#CR22)] suggests that negative externalities
    represent the hidden costs of market exchanges and that we remain ignorant of
    their true costs unless these are identified and quantified. The most important

    a governance system based on a highly speculative design make it inadvisable.
    Moreover, it totally contradicts the 2030 Agenda’s SDGs. The case of Ethereum

    intelligent solution to simplify processes and improve efficiency, it still uses
    consensus transaction systems—like PoW or PoS (Proof of Stake)—which constitute
    separate networks that move away from the paths of sustainability due to the energy
    they invest in mining tokens. Nonetheless, it is an interesting starting point
    from which to establish designs and applications that help develop CE projects

    context. We define a BaaS perspective as being one in which we offer a cloud-based
    solution for users to build their own dApps and their own blockchains. These would
    include applications and smart contracts and defy the current mainstream framework
    under the umbrella of the Ethereum platform.

    Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum is eco-friendly solutions and both contradict the
    SDGs with regard to energy consumption and operative governance models. Sustainable
    Development Goals 16 and 17 demand a new governance model for future DLTs. Therefore,
    a new generation of DLTs will need to provide an accurate answer to the problems
    of the currently best-known blockchain platforms.

    deployment of dApps, cutting consumption of electricity and simplifying dApp adoption,
    both in the market and for end-users. Furthermore, as propose, this approach can
    facilitate the tokenization of IoT devices, as we mentioned earlier. Merging a
    BaaS perspective with IoT tokenization (a BIoT approach) is one of the most striking
    challenges in securing the traceability of CE project processes.

    is based on a tokenizable model for CE projects. Within this kind of DLT framework—called
    RETIS—a two layer ledger enhances the security of platform-issued tokens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This ledger of ledgers is called ARCA. It acts on two levels; on the first,
    it guarantees the transmission of the data contained in the tokens, distributing
    this to all participating nodes. On the second level—which controls the governance
    of ledger management and of the transactions that occur in it, with specific hashes
    for their issuance—all nodes are synchronized.

    a cascade-of-nodes system. To do so, it uses two types of nodes: so-called “slaves”,
    which are established by the light nodes (those deployed in a cloud); and “master”
    nodes, which are deployed within the platform system with dedicated hardware.
    The cascade-of-nodes system is designed to perform double verification of the
    data and/or smart contracts to be transacted. The slave nodes are in charge of
    verifying all orders from the master node before including them in the corresponding
    block. This system issues tokens with an average of 150000 transactions per second,
    use no type of payment and does not involve high energy costs because of its internal
    governance.'

    which can protect assets from any physical medium in real environments. It acts
    as a virtual safe box with two different private keys to access the information
    stored in each token contained within it. As well as facilitating massive transactions,
    it can be deployed on all types of devices (smartphones, Raspberry, tablets),
    and can be used with multiple technologies (Doker, Kubernetes, etc.). By virtue
    of its dual-tier architecture, ARCA seamlessly integrates with Hyperledger for
    guaranteed interoperability. Hence, the tokens issued can be exported or imported
    from other ledgers.

    It facilitates block building in each of the blockchains on the platform. This
    ensures vertical and horizontal scalability (permitting thousands of transactions
    per second in RETIS) that forms a 3D mesh to deal with all data from all operators
    in a CE project. This process was defined by [[3](#CR3)]. Moreover, the platform
    includes EQUO, a framework that acts as a tool to develop native dApps.

    from the scientific fields that surround it. Contributions from technology are
    also necessary and welcome. The blockchain in particular can be a validation tool
    for CE-related issues of sustainability. However, we would stress that it must
    also be supported by sustainable mining, with renewable energy and the reuse of
    materials and equipment, to avoid increasing companies’ carbon footprints. Once
    this obstacle has been overcome, we consider that blockchain technology will offer
    the CE a wide range of alternative applications, especially with regard to the
    measurement, certification, and recording of sustainability indicators, measurements,
    parameters, footprints, and so on.

    emergent digital technologies could represent for a more sustainable economy,
    a true circular economy. Both CE and blockchain technology have emerged in the
    last decade, and they are not alone. The current digital revolution affects emerging
    technologies like Artificial Intelligence, robotics, the IoT, and quantum computing.
    The creative, experimental combination of all of these will enable us to generate
    more efficient solutions and tackle new, more complex problems than we are currently
    capable of handling. Energy sustainability in the use of these technologies is
    essential for them to form part of a general CE framework. Similarly, the consumption
    of minerals and other resources in the manufacture of these systems poses significant
    challenges to the CE itself. While it is true that digitization enables us to
    reduce certain types of consumption—of paper, for example—it sharply increases
    others, generating environmental and social problems.

    hand for decades to come. We predict significant successes together with challenges
    that are even more complex than those we currently face, given that social expectations
    of these systems are gradually growing. In the future, one very important challenge
    will be to determine how to merge blockchain and Artificial Intelligence solutions
    to achieve more efficient, sustainable platforms and tools to manage CE projects.
    Another will be how to deploy simple, easily-used, state-of-the-art blockchains
    (DLTs) in specific projects, within a scalable, interoperable framework, which
    provides all stakeholders with easy access.

    that, in combination with DLTs, provide even more comprehensive solutions.
