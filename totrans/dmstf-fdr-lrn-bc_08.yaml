- en: The cumulative amount of greenhouse gases that are shaped by our actions is
    a carbon footmark. In the US, the total carbon footmark of a humanoid is 16 tonnes,
    one of the largest amounts in the world. The average is closer to 4 tonnes worldwide.
    The average universal carbon footmark per year requirements is to drop below 3
    tonnes by 2050 to have the utmost chance of stopping a 2°C point rise in worldwide
    temperature. Rahul et al. already predicted that the carbon footprint reduced
    by 17% with the use of IoT-enabled services. In this research study a novel approach
    to reduce carbon footprint using IoT with reinforcement AI learning is presented,
    which further reduced carbon footprint by 5% when using and nearly 7% when it
    is done using Q-Learning. The detailed findings are included to demonstrate the
    result.

- en: A carbon footmark is the quantity of greenhouse vapours emitted by a single
    humanoid operation into the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide (Whig et al., 2022).
    A carbon footprint may be a large measure that can be attributed to an individual's
    behaviour, a family, a case, an entity, or even a country as a whole (Anand et
    al., 2022). Tons of CO[2] corresponding gases, counting methane, nitrous oxide,
    and other greenhouse vapours, are typically measured as tonnes of CO[2] produced
    each year, an amount that can be augmented with tonnes of CO[2] corresponding
    vapours (Alkali et al., 2022; Chopra & WHIG, 2022).

- en: Many variables are taken into account when assessing a carbon footprint some
    are shown in Figure.1\. Pouring to the grocery supply, for instance, burns a sure
    quantity of gasoline, and the main foundations of greenhouse gases are fossil
    fuels (Chopra & Whig, 2022b, 2022a; Madhu & WHIG, 2022). Yet the grocery shop
    is operated by gas, and the workers have probably gone to work, meaning the store
    has a carbon footprint of its own. In addition, all the items that the store offers
    have been delivered there, meaning that the overall carbon emissions must also
    be taken into account (Bhargav & Whig, 2021; George et al., 2021; Khera et al.,
    2021; Mamza, 2021; Pawar, 2021; Whig & Rupani, 2020). In comparison, the berries,
    potatoes and essences produced by the supermarket were all cultivated or raised
    on plantations, a methane producing operation that has a greenhouse effect 25
    times greater than CO[2] (Arun Velu, 2021; Reddy, 2019; Velu & Whig, 2021; verma,
    2019; Whig, 2019b, 2019a). The carbon foot print is well defined by Figure 1.

    according to NASA. The United States receives about 81 percent of its overall
    electricity from the combustion of fossil fuels, according to the National Academy
    of Sciences (chouhan, 2019; Mathurkar et al., 2021; Nadikattu et al., 2020b, 2021;
    Ruchin & Whig, 2015; Sharma et al., 2016; Shrivastav et al., n.d.). One of the
    key reasons that green energy still needs to take off in the United States, or
    internationally, is that it is still impossible to store renewable energy sources.
    IoT has the ability to transform electricity grids by smart metering and forecasts
    to be powered by renewable sources such as wind and solar power. By converting
    from fossil fuels to clean energy sources, big cities are expected to reduce their
    carbon dioxide emissions by more than half (Chopra & Whig, 2021; Nadikattu et
    al., 2020a; Velu & Whig, n.d.; Whig2*, 2020). New technologies, in Industry 4.0
    like AI, IoT and ML have been seen as a boon to reducing Carbon footprint. IoT
    Plays an important role in reducing Carbon Footprint (S. N. Ahmad & Whig, 2011;
    Pawan Whig 2 Anupam Priyam3, 2018; Whig & Ahmad, 2018).

    buildings, maintaining track of occupancy and other variables (Bhatia & Whig,

    learning (P. W. and S. N. Ahmad, n.d.; ahmad, 2016). To come up with a solution
    to the problem, the machine uses trial and error. For the actions it performs,
    the artificial intelligence receives either rewards or penalties to get the machine
    to do what the programmer wants. Its aim is to optimize the cumulative payout
    (Rashmi Sinha, 2015).

    energy per capita and primary energy consumption are increased drastically being
    a major cause in the increase in carbon level.

    Primary energy consumption and it is observed that R²= 0.9533\. It is observed
    that the Energy per capita is 95% similar to Primary energy per capita and is
    5% dissimilar to it.

- en: Thus, it is concluded that the use of IOT with Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
    is the most efficient and fruitful to reduce the Carbon Footprint as compared
    to any other technology implementation because it reduces the Carbon emission
    by 30% as compared to a house without IOT whereas only IOT implementation reduces
    it by 23% and IOT with Reinforcement Learning (Markov decision process) reduces
    it by 28%.
