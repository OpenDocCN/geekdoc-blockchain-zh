  zh: 加密货币冬天
- en: As cryptocurrency prices rose, more financial experts and economists attacked
    the very notion of a cryptocurrency. Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman
    said that, contrary to what many seemed to believe, Bitcoin represented not the
    future of money but a three-hundred-year step backward. “Cryptocurrencies have
    no backstop, no tether to reality,” he wrote. “If speculators were to have a collective
    moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins
    would become worthless.”

  zh: 随着加密货币价格的上涨，更多金融专家和经济学家开始攻击加密货币的概念。经济学家和诺贝尔奖得主保罗·克鲁格曼表示，与许多人相信的相反，比特币代表的是货币的未来，而是一个三百年的倒退。他写道：“加密货币没有后盾，没有与现实相连的锚。“如果投机者突然怀疑比特币毫无价值，那么，比特币就会变得毫无价值。”

- en: Others noted that investors had given cryptocurrencies two tasks that were impossible
    to accomplish at the same time. On one hand, speculators were hoping cryptocurrencies
    would gain value as they attracted attention. On the other, cryptocurrencies were
    supposed to be a medium of exchange that could buy pizza, a sweater, and a car.
    But people wouldn’t make small purchases such as these using their very valuable
    cryptocurrency balances. As financial journalist Dan McCrum observed, “No one
    uses gold bars from the safe for petty cash.”

- en: As if to prove the critics right, Bitcoin prices began to fall in early 2018
    and then entered a rout. By spring the price had plunged from a high near $20,000
    to below $7,500\. By the end of the year, it had sunk below $4,000\. While Bitcoin
    had still delivered extraordinary returns for those who had gotten in early, many
    investors who joined in 2017 were left whiplashed. Most investors who snapped
    up ICOs ended up with catastrophic losses.
