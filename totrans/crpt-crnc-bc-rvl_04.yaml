- en: As cryptocurrency prices rose, more financial experts and economists attacked
    the very notion of a cryptocurrency. Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman
    said that, contrary to what many seemed to believe, Bitcoin represented not the
    future of money but a three-hundred-year step backward. “Cryptocurrencies have
    no backstop, no tether to reality,” he wrote. “If speculators were to have a collective
    moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins
    would become worthless.”

    to accomplish at the same time. On one hand, speculators were hoping cryptocurrencies
    would gain value as they attracted attention. On the other, cryptocurrencies were
    supposed to be a medium of exchange that could buy pizza, a sweater, and a car.
    But people wouldn’t make small purchases such as these using their very valuable
    cryptocurrency balances. As financial journalist Dan McCrum observed, “No one
    uses gold bars from the safe for petty cash.”

    and then entered a rout. By spring the price had plunged from a high near $20,000
    to below $7,500\. By the end of the year, it had sunk below $4,000\. While Bitcoin
    had still delivered extraordinary returns for those who had gotten in early, many
    investors who joined in 2017 were left whiplashed. Most investors who snapped
    up ICOs ended up with catastrophic losses.

    remains a niche, even elite, pursuit,” he wrote.

    Buffett about the promise of blockchain and to get valuable tips from him on entrepreneurship

- en: Falling prices weren’t the only problem Bitcoin faced. One company, Bitwise
    Asset Management, studied all the Bitcoin trades that occurred over a four-day
    period in March 2019\. It used computer analysis to determine which had been completed
    by real human traders rather than computer-driven programs. Bitwise discovered
    that of nearly $6 billion in reported trades, only $273 million was legitimate.
    This study added to skepticism that investors were actually trading Bitcoin—that
    is, that large amounts of Bitcoin were changing hands each day. Some exchanges,
    it appeared, were trying to inflate their numbers to get a higher ranking on data
    services that would then attract other cryptocurrencies to list there. The more
    cryptocurrencies an exchange offered, the more it received in listing fees and,
    ultimately, in trading.

    As Bitcoin prices fell, crypto supporters comforted and urged one another to “HODL.”
    The term supposedly originated from a crypto supporter in a forum who, in a bout
    of bad typing or out of drunkenness, posted “I AM HODLING.” The phrase evolved
    into a shorthand for holders determined to keep their cryptocurrencies for the
    long term despite short-term volatility and crushing losses. They rejected “FUD”—fear,
    uncertainty, and doubt.

    of fiat currency point out it will always have worth because citizens normally
    pay taxes in their government’s money. In addition, the government then uses those
    funds to pay for public services. However, in November 2018, the State of Ohio
    became the first to accept Bitcoin for tax payments (though the tax bill was still
    in US dollars), setting a precedent for other states to follow.

    of the computer power devoted to mining peaked in mid-2018 and then fell by almost

    In fact, venture capitalists invested four times more money in 2018 in blockchain
    companies than they did in 2017\. But cryptocurrencies attracted less desirable
    attention as well. As interest in cryptocurrencies grew, so did the number of
    thieves and hackers who saw opportunities to enrich themselves.
