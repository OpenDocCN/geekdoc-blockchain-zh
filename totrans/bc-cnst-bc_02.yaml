    Blockchain is an opportunity to create novel forms of economic coordination toward
    better collaboration within and across the built asset life cycle phases. Ongoing
    research tends to focus on blockchain to increase trust in existing processes.
    Instead, we argue blockchain’s disruptive potential is the creation of novel economic
    coordination. Therefore, we intend to advance the thinking around the promise
    of blockchain as an institutional innovation in the construction industry. First,
    we explain how the underlying cryptoeconomic governance mechanisms of blockchain
    can facilitate new decentralized coordination mechanisms between both humans and
    machines. Next, we provide an alternative vision for the governance of construction
    4.0 to explain how cryptoeconomic coordination can address long-standing problems
    in the construction industry. Finally, we propose an adoption framework that can
    guide researchers and practitioners to explore the promise of blockchain and cryptoeconomics
    for the construction industry.

    innovation with the potential to disrupt and substitute existing economic coordination
    [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)]. However, many ongoing research projects develop blockchain
    solutions to increase trust in existing processes. While these are valid and beneficial
    in the short term, they can miss the opportunity to redesign processes and systems
    to the full potential of this new technology.

    network effects and shared digital infrastructure do not come at the cost of increased
    market power and data access by platform operators [[3](#CR3)]. This is achieved
    through blockchain governance, where *cryptoeconomics* incentivizes participants
    through the exchange and distribution of tokens to secure the network. Cryptoeconomics
    enables new forms of economic activity beyond existing forms of monetary incentives
    by taking into account both endogenic and exogenic system variables [[4](#CR4)].
    This is a feature that might be particularly useful for more efficient means of
    coordination in the construction industry. Such new cryptoeconomic systems can
    be created by individuals for any economic system, independent of the traditional
    makers of economies [[5](#CR5)]. Despite this new opportunity to individually
    tailor coordination mechanisms for the construction industry, less thinking has
    been done to imagine implications on a longer time horizon.

    as an institutional innovation in the construction industry. We outline why blockchain
    can be an opportunity to foster collaboration through new economic coordination
    within and across the built asset life cycle phases by describing the connection
    of blockchain governance with the characteristics of the construction industry.
    First, we introduce how blockchain governance is an inherent feature of blockchain,
    enabling the specific affordances associated with the technology. We then discuss
    how those affordances can facilitate new decentralized governance mechanisms between
    humans and machines built on the underlying blockchain networks. Afterward, we
    highlight why blockchain-based governance is especially promising for the construction
    industry. We then introduce a framework to structure the adoption of blockchain
    in construction on three levels through a blockchain-based governance lens. Finally,
    we discuss the contribution, limitations, and outlook.

- en: The ledger represents the data structure of a blockchain, where transactions
    are recorded. The main role of the ledger is to ensure integrity (i.e., explicit
    verifiability of the uniqueness of transactions) through timestamping transactions
    with the cryptographic process of hashing, and applying one-way mathematical functions
    repeatedly to the transaction data. These unique hashes are included in a block
    together with the hash of the previous block. This forms a growing sequential
    chain of transactions that allows noticing if past transaction data has been tampered.
    All data in the ledger is public, transparent, and accessible to everyone in the
    network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ledger runs then simultaneously on different computers, forming a distributed
    network of so-called *nodes*. This creates the possibility to cross-check the
    ledger among all copies in the network to detect malicious versions. It also ensures
    the decentralization of the network. It is very difficult to attack the network
    by taking down nodes since operations will still be ensured by all other nodes
    distributed across the globe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the real challenge is coordinating how nodes in the network validate,
    agree, and write transactions to the ledger without relying on centralized coordinators.
    This was solved for the first time with Bitcoin using a cryptoeconomic governance
    mechanism—the real innovation behind blockchain. On the protocol level of a blockchain,
    this governance process is called the consensus mechanism. In the specific case
    of Bitcoin, a mechanism called proof-of-work protects the network effectively
    from attacks [[11](#CR11)]. A native coin, e.g., bitcoin in Bitcoin or ether in
    Ethereum, incentivizes participants to behave in the interest of the blockchain
    network by compensating nodes that correctly validate and add transactions. As
    long as the majority of these so-called *miners* are more profitable to behave
    honestly, the chain is protected.

    a decentralized network. The network is not controlled by any single actor but
    by consensus code protocols that incentivize the participants toward coordination.
    Blockchains only work because of their cryptoeconomic governance mechanisms—a
    new way of trust-minimized social coordination. Bitcoin, a new decentralized monetary
    system and asset class, was the first and most popular example of such a network
    that has proven to be very secure and resilient.

    can be used to create autonomous workflows for any process that can be formalized
    into programmable rules. In essence, smart contracts encode custom rules on the

    that are open to all (*permissionless*), and transactions can be verified by anyone
    (*public*). They only exist because of the cryptoeconomic governance mechanisms
    that enforce the network rules between all anonymous network participants. Such
    blockchains are generally slow and expensive to use. On the upside, they provide
    the introduced affordances. When referring to blockchain without further specification
    in this chapter, we mean public permissionless blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because it will be insightful to compare the potential path of blockchain-based
    governance adoption in the built environment with the different types of blockchains,
    we make here a short excursion to *private permissioned* blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes institutions are enticed by some blockchain characteristics, but the
    envisioned applications conflict with other affordances of public permissionless
    blockchains. This is often because they want to apply blockchain to existing use
    cases or industry particularities that require restricted infrastructure control
    or data visibility for only a known group. Setting up a blockchain so that only
    this group can join the network and verify transactions results in what is called
    a *permissioned* blockchain. If the network only allows this group to see the
    transactions, it is referred to as a *private* blockchain. If the use case indeed
    needs one of these properties, private permissioned blockchains could be a suitable
    solution [[9](#CR9)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, private permissioned blockchains replicate in some sense existing
    systems with their limitations and curtail possible new forms of economic coordination.
    This is because the rules and operation of the network are ensured and coordinated
    by known actors. Therefore, no cryptoeconomic governance is needed. This makes
    these networks typically faster than public permissionless blockchains.^([1](#Fn1))
    It is also possible to launch smart contracts and tokens on private permissioned
    blockchains. However, such applications will always need to trust the operators
    of the network. Users must be confident that the operators will not shut down
    the system or that the system could be manipulated by a few actors [[12](#CR12)].
    Of course, dependent on the number and diversity of stakeholders running the network,
    private blockchains can still be more trustworthy than traditional centralized
    platforms. In the end, the chosen system should reflect the requirements of a
    given use case by assessing whether and which blockchain is needed [[9](#CR9)].

    a wide selection of use cases. On the one hand, immutable P2P transactions (Fig. [2](#Fig2),
    [A1]), transparency (Fig. [2](#Fig2), [A2]), and scalability (Fig. [2](#Fig2),
    [A3]) allow creation of trusted digital processes to coordinate the global economic
    activity of actors in a decentralized way. Transactions can be conducted directly
    between parties and are not subject to control by other actors (Fig. [2](#Fig2),
    [A]). The simplest use case is transferring protocol native coins (e.g., bitcoin
    or ether) between users. However, other use cases can profit from reaching a consensus
    about individual transactions at the system level. To implement more advanced
    logic on-chain, smart contracts (Fig. [2](#Fig2), [A4]) can encode processes on
    the application layer for various purposes. Since blockchains identify network
    actors only through addresses, both humans and machines can trade with each other
    without the need to disclose their identities. The blockchain ensures confidence
    between pseudonymous (only address is known) actors to trade value peer-to-peer – facilitating
    decentralized market structures not controlled by anyone. For now, such decentralized
    applications (termed dApp’s) are predominantly decentralized financial applications
    (termed DeFi) that replicate existing financial services without the need for
    intermediaries [[18](#CR18)].

    (Fig. [2](#Fig2), [B2]). With that, it is possible to create economic activity
    on the application level, similar to how the underlying blockchain protocols use
    cryptoeconomics to incentivize the operation of their networks. Applications can
    create their own networks with comparable blockchain characteristics, without

- en: CPRs are natural (e.g., forests, pastures, or fishing grounds) or man-made (e.g.,
    irrigation systems or wiki libraries) resources, which are freely shared among
    many users [[20](#CR20)]. The *tragedy of the commons* occurs when users of a
    CPR “overuse”, e.g., “overfish” in the case of fishing grounds, by appropriating
    resources at a higher than the optimal rate in self-interested behavior, resulting
    in a downward spiral of total resource availability [[21](#CR21)]. Historically,
    the common belief was that only centralized and top-down control can coordinate
    optimal resource appropriation, e.g. government interventions. More recent work
    pioneered by economist Elinor Ostrom [[22](#CR22)–[24](#CR24)] and others [[25](#CR25)]
    showed that local actors without a central authority could be more successful
    in sustaining the commons. This self-coordination of resource appropriation can
    be guided by governance design principles—referred to as the eight Ostrom principles.
    The Ostrom principles have been successfully used in many commons-based communities
    to craft effective governance rules without any top-down control [[26](#CR26)].
    However, bottom-up coordination incurs a high cost of information exchange. It
    is tough to scale community governance based on the Ostrom principles to large
    and global systems [[27](#CR27)].

    much aligned with the lens of CPR theory and the Ostrom principles [[28](#CR28),
    [29](#CR29)]. Blockchains have been described as commons-based peer production
    of free and open-source software [[30](#CR30)]. Consequently, blockchains can
    be seen as early evidence of the successful scaling of real-world commons (software)
    on a global scale through new forms of bottom-up economic coordination.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, it is not surprising that emerging literature suggests blockchain
    as a tool to build applications that can scale real-world examples of commons
    [[31](#CR31)]. The potential lies in overcoming collective action problems by
    using blockchain's transparency and incentive systems to build bottom-up coordination.
    Because of their cryptoeconomic governance mechanisms, blockchains decrease the
    cost of information exchange by minimizing opportunism and uncertainty by combining
    transparency with cryptographic enforcement [[32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)]. The adoption
    of blockchain-based transparent decision-making procedures and decentralized incentive
    systems for community governance in commons could help avoid the tragedy of the
    commons [[34](#CR34)]. The Ostrom principles could guide such applications by
    encoding respective governance rules [[35](#CR35), [36](#CR36)]. With that blockchain
    could create networked governance to scale real-world commons, similar to how
    the stock market enabled corporations to scale [[37](#CR37)]. Such crypto commons
    could allow new types of value creation with crypto assets rather than shares
    of stock, contributors rather than employees, and decentralized collaboration
    rather than centralized ownership [[37](#CR37)]. Overall, collective action use
    cases might be more efficiently governed by crypto-commons rather than existing
    forms of centralized and top-down forms of coordination.

    cryptoeconomic coordination on the blockchain is called a decentralized autonomous
    organization (DAO). A DAO is a blockchain-powered organization that can run without
    any central authority [[38](#CR38)]. The decentralized governance of a DAO is
    facilitated by a set of self-executing rules deployed with smart contracts on
    a blockchain to enable self-coordination and governance of people [[39](#CR39)].
    By defining governance mechanisms in smart contracts, the DAO can self-operate,
    self-govern, and self-evolve [[38](#CR38)]. It is essential to note the difference
    between a DAO and operations that use artificial intelligence (AI) [[15](#CR15),
    [16](#CR16)]. An AI system is often designed to make internal autonomous decisions.
    By contrast, a DAO defines its own coordination rules and governance system. In
    this way, it can make decisions based on the external input of participating actors.
    These actors only need to own a recognized address, so the actors can be machines,
    another DAO, or a distributed group of human decision-makers.

    new. For example, integrated project delivery (IPD) is a project delivery model
    that creates inter-organizational governance structures to jointly manage complex
    projects across firm boundaries [[46](#CR46)]. While some project delivery models
    use only informal mechanisms of collaboration [[46](#CR46), [52](#CR52), [53](#CR53)],
    the current trend has been the development of formalized incentive structures
    through the use of multi-party relational contracts. Project clients, contractors,
    and planners collaborate on equal standing with their own decision-making power
    and autonomy [[54](#CR54)], yet are incentivized to make decisions for the collective
    good. Target Value Design and Shared Risk Rewards are examples of such performance-oriented
    bottom-up incentive structures [[55](#CR55), [56](#CR56)]. Cryptoeconomic governance
    could improve and extend such incentive structures with tokenization and smart
    legal contracts. In the longer term, embracing cryptoeconomic incentives could
    slowly reduce the negative impacts of fragmentation without the need to integrate
    the value chain through centralized approaches.

    and interactions among these influence the functioning of the overall system [[57](#CR57),
    [58](#CR58)]. System-level characteristics cannot be understood as a simple sum
    of subsystem behaviors. Instead, properties such as emergence, adaptation, spontaneous
    order, feedback loops, and nonlinear behavior of the overall system need to be
    expected [[57](#CR57)]. The internal interactions of the networked subsystems
    are often stronger than external control attempts [[58](#CR58)]. This is why complex
    systems behave strangely in the eyes of humans that are used to think in linear
    ways with a proportional outcome to a given input, and therefore governance of
    such systems is often perceived as very difficult [[59](#CR59)].

    many multidisciplinary individuals and firms equally valuable in the system's
    operation [[60](#CR60), [61](#CR61)]. The construction workflow has high interdependence
    between stakeholders and many overlaps of construction stages and elements [[62](#CR62)].
    Design and coordination tasks often require reciprocal interdependence between
    the involved parties [[63](#CR63), [64](#CR64)]. Project outcomes and performance
    indicators must be already defined at the initial stage of a project, so they
    are likely to change throughout the project [[65](#CR65)]. Finally, there are
    many uncertainties from external parties (e.g., from authorities, governments,
    or law), resources (labor, equipment, material), or the environment (e.g., weather,
    traffic) [[62](#CR62)].

    model. Over the past several decades, the classical project delivery is managed
    using “command-and-control” project management with layers of contractual and
    organizational hierarchies [[54](#CR54)]. A typical construction project hierarchy
    will spread across multiple vertical tiers and can include hundreds of subcontracted
    specialty firms across the supply chain. Even though cooperation would be crucial
    to deal with the mentioned challenges, insufficient and untimely communication
    is more the norm than the exception [[66](#CR66)]. Contentious behavior and lack
    of cooperation reduce the system's efficiency compared to the sum of individual
    efforts [[46](#CR46)]. Over time, this can result in sub-optimization and self-interest
    to the detriment of the overall project [[65](#CR65)]. We can find indications
    of the failure of hierarchical management structures in many construction projects
    that ended up in court to resolve disputes over “unforeseen problems leading to
    cost and time overruns” [[67](#CR67)].

    system does not always do what is desired. The internal nonlinear interactions
    often dominate the external control attempts. Sometimes small but right changes
    cause the system to change, while large efforts might remain useless. Classical,
    hierarchical control attempts are likely to fail. Instead, one should use self-organization
    as part of the management strategy. Self-organized networks need room to establish
    with increased flexibility of participants. Detailed regulations hardly ever create
    an effect. They rather reduce flexibility and make the required processes inefficient,
    complicated, and expensive. Harmonic overall dynamics is more important than individual
    performance at their limit, and faster end up to be often slower in complex systems.

    based on some simple rules at the individual level, behaving towards an optimal
    overall system state. A well-known example in nature is bee hives, where simple
    rules govern the behavior of individual bees [[68](#CR68)], but at the population
    level, maximize the payoff of foraging [[69](#CR69)]. Even though self-organization
    works very well in nature, it will likely not meet the targeted outcome in many
    artificial systems. In most cases, it is not possible to find such simple rules
    at the individual level that optimize the overall system state. Therefore, complex
    engineered systems need to be directed minimally invasive to create desired outcomes
    with “guided self-organization” by changing the interactions in complex systems
    [[70](#CR70)] through approaches of mechanism design or complexity science to
    guide individuals towards optimizing the overall system state. Guided self-organization
    can successfully optimize production systems [[71](#CR71)], logistics [[72](#CR72),
    [73](#CR73)], traffic flow with bottom-up traffic light control [[74](#CR74)],
    or the overall system output of wind farms [[75](#CR75)]. Furthermore, changing

    through cryptoeconomics can be an enabler for bottom-up coordination [[42](#CR42)]
    toward self-organization. In decentralized systems, decreasing the cost of coordination
    is extremely important through real-time and transparent information feedback
    distributed to all relevant parties. This allows informed and coordinated bottom-up
    reactions to unexpected events. Currently, these information flows are passed
    through the hierarchical systems, leading to slow responses. New technological
    advances enable these needed fast feedback loops by providing an extensive real-time
    data baseline [[70](#CR70)]. Blockchain-based governance processes are promising
    to support data-driven bottom-up and collective decision-making by creating cryptoeconomic
    incentives to guide individual actors toward behavior that optimizes the overall

    in the construction industry. The construction industry is characterized by complexity
    and can be described as a loosely coupled network managed with top-down approaches
    (Fig. [5](#Fig5), light gray dots). However, an efficient overall system should
    be either targeted toward hierarchies or networks [[84](#CR84)]. Hypothetically,
    one option is to move the industry structure towards vertical integration, removing
    complexity through more streamlined supply chains (Fig. [5](#Fig5), industry structure
    arrow). This would lead to less fragmentation with the same actors across phases
    and trades and standardization across projects. The other option would be to move
    governance approaches toward bottom-up management and embrace complex aspects
    of the industry (Fig. [5](#Fig5), governance arrow). Both approaches are feasible
    if assuming that it is indeed possible to reduce complexity. However, it is somewhat
    hard to believe that all the complex aspects of the industry can be eliminated.
    Additionally, industrialization and digitalization will only increase in our world,
    directing global systems towards new socio-technical paradigms with inevitable
    cascading effects on interconnected and complex ecosystems [[85](#CR85)]. As our
    world's complexity and interaction strengths increase, centralized and controlled
    systems can become unstable, and highly skilled, well-informed, and well-intentioned
    system managers can still lose control [[85](#CR85)]. With this in mind, the decentralized
    nature of the construction industry could also be perceived as a strength that
    makes the industry more resilient to such risks. With the increased adoption of
    technology in the construction industry, cryptoeconomic governance provides an
    opportunity to build bottom-up coordination mechanisms towards “peer-production”
    of the built environment to better handle complex aspects of construction aligned

    In fact, they might be even better suited to test applications since they offer
    more control over the infrastructure, transaction privacy, involve no transaction
    costs for the user, and are usually faster without the need to use additional
    scaling solutions. Most of the above research uses a private permissioned blockchain.
    However, private permissioned blockchains make no use of blockchain governance
    mechanisms to create confidence in the affordances but rely on trusting the parties
    operating and running the network. Use cases in the built environment often have
    long time horizons, so trusting a system that actors can shut down is likely less
    of an option with real-world implementations and more capital involved. Consequently,

    4.0 concepts comes at an interesting time given industry trends. Industry 4.0
    creates opportunities to disintermediate physical supply chains, increase servitization,

    By contrast, recent momentum in the construction industry trends toward vertically
    integrated firms [[138](#CR138)] and increased conceptualization of the building
    as a product ([[139](#CR139)], p. 391). The current vision of construction 4.0
    seems very much oriented toward the adoption of successful concepts in the manufacturing
    industry, promising higher productivity levels for construction. Potential bottom-up
    coordination targeted toward a more decentralized industry structure organized
    around smaller firms and projects seems somewhat contrarian to this approach.
    More research should investigate how current visions of construction 4.0, such
    as platformization and productization, are connected to this vision. How would
    the construction industry organize through crypto-commons-based community structures
    and DAOs? Is this an alternative vision to current construction 4.0 roadmaps?
    Or is it a similar approach, just enabled through many smaller actors rather than
    big vertically integrated players? To motivate more research toward building decentralized
    and bottom-up coordination, the industry needs to perceive blockchain as valuable
    for the overall vision of construction 4.0\. It is an opportunity to rethink the
    organizational relationships of the construction industry in the context of the
    ongoing cyber-physical convergence [[140](#CR140)].

- en: Summarized, we believe that the construction industry is very aligned with the
    potential of cryptoeconomic governance to overcome collective action problems
    as in CPR scenarios, potentially in the organizational form of a DAO. Commons-like
    structures for construction could enable new ways for individuals and communities
    of practice to contribute to value creation without formal affiliation to a centralized
    project organization or firm. Business ecosystems that bundle the expertise of
    highly innovative smaller actors such as individuals and SMEs could also thrive
    in such an organizational context. They could potentially match presumed benefits
    of vertically integrated large companies such as reduced transaction costs and
    inter-project knowledge preservation, without associated disadvantages such as
    lack of flexibility and high cost of new knowledge acquisition. Decentralized
    bottom-up coordination supported by cryptoeconomic governance mechanisms could
    be an alternative vision toward a decentralized construction 4.0 to better deal
    with its complexity and fragmentation characteristics.
