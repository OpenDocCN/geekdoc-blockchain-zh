- en: Over the last decade, cryptocurrency markets have remarkably evolved. Cryptocurrencies
    as a medium of exchange could seem attractive to potential users as a result of
    their user anonymity, low transaction costs stemming from no intermediary involvement,
    and the fact that an increasing number of retailers has started accepting Bitcoin
    payments enabling cryptocurrency users to purchase goods, including illegal ones.
    Notwithstanding, cryptocurrencies are primarily traded for speculation purposes
    instead of as a traditional medium of exchange due to the fact that they can provide
    their users with the potential of reaching extremely high gains in very short
    periods of time, despite concerns about risks associated with their unprecedented
    price fluctuations raised by economists and financial institutions. Furthermore,
    cryptocurrencies resemble more financial assets rather than fiat currencies due
    to their volatility, persistence, heavy tail behaviour, and vulnerability to speculative
    bubbles, among other properties. This chapter will therefore discuss the financial
    characteristics of cryptocurrencies. We will start by looking at their statistical
    properties and then learn about their properties that make them resemble financial
    assets, but also about interdependencies of cryptocurrencies as well as their
    relationship with mainstream financial assets.

    with numerous altcoins having been introduced. Although Bitcoin has been the most
    popular cryptocurrency due to the fact that it constitutes the first implementation
    of the concept of a digital currency, as of August 2019 there are more than 2500
    cryptocurrencies in existence with the total market capitalisation being estimated
    to exceed $246 billion ([coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com), accessed
    on 29th August 2019). As illustrated in [Figure 1](#b_9783110660807-004_fig_001),
    while Bitcoin represented about 94% of the total estimated market capitalisation
    in May 2013, its market share dropped to 33% in January 2018, as a result of the
    increase in popularity and, thus, in market capitalisation of more recently launched
    cryptocurrencies which have been attracting significant trading volumes. Such
    fluctuations in Bitcoin’ market share have raised concerns about Bitcoin’s long-term
    sustainability as well as about the increased competition between cryptocurrencies
    ([Dowd](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_024), [2014](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_024)).

    statistical properties. We restrict to cryptocurrencies that have been in existence
    for three years with a market capitalisation in excess of 500 million US Dollars
    (as of 18^(th) August 2019). The cryptocurrencies meeting these criteria are Bitcoin,
    Ether, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Stellar Lumen, Dash, NEO, and Ethereum Classic.
    [Table 1](#b_9783110660807-004_tab_001) lists several characteristics, including
    the market capitalisation and 24-hour trading volume, of the considered cryptocurrencies
    as of 18^(th) August 2018, with their total market capitalisation reaching approximately
    $228 billion, therefore representing circa 96% of the total market capitalisation
    of cryptocurrencies in circulation, with Bitcoin’s market capitalisation in particular
    being 185 US Dollars, a figure that is about nine times higher than that of, e. g.,
    Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency. The dataset therefore consists of daily
    closing prices for these nine cryptocurrencies from 9^(th) September 2015 (as
    the earliest date available for NEO) to 15^(th) August 2019\. The data were sourced
    at [https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/](https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/) and the
    prices are listed in US Dollars.

    closing prices of the nine cryptocurrencies considered over their common sample
    covering the period from 9^(th) September 2016 to 15^(th) August 2019\. It can
    be noticed that the prices of the altcoins would be stable until the end of the
    first quarter of 2017, whereas the prices of Bitcoin would steadily increase.
    However, from the second quarter of 2017 until the end of 2017 there were severe
    price fluctuations leading to a significant and rapid growth in the prices of
    all the cryptocurrencies, while from the beginning of 2018 onwards all prices
    started declining. Nevertheless, not all prices shared an identical trend of decline
    in 2018\. Moreover, while all cryptocurrencies experienced price appreciations
    again in 2019, the price increase was more significant for Bitcoin and Litecoin,
    with the price of the latter somewhat mirroring the price of Bitcoin. [Figure
    2](#b_9783110660807-004_fig_002) therefore illustrates that all prices seem to
    move in a similar pattern and to be correlated, especially during the growth period.
    Indeed, the Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures the strength of the
    association between two variables, for the different pairs of cryptocurrencies’
    prices (reported in [Table 2](#b_9783110660807-004_tab_002)) confirms this fact,
    since all the correlation coefficients are positive – ranging from 0.6832 to 0.9480
    – and significant. Interestingly, this result is true not only for any Bitcoin-altcoin
    pair as could have been expected, due to the fact that most altcoin buy and sell
    orders are executed in Bitcoin, but also for any other pair of altcoins.'

    defined as the first difference of the logarithmic prices on two consecutive days
    over the common sample period are reported in Panel A of [Table 3](#b_9783110660807-004_tab_003).
    Interestingly, while the average daily closing price returns are positive for
    all the cryptocurrencies considered, ranging from 0.13% (Ethereum Classic) to
    0.36% (Ripple), suggesting that the highest return on average was obtained for
    Ripple over the common sample period from 9^(th) September 2016 to 15^(th) August
    2019, the median is positive only for Bitcoin and Ether. The standard deviation
    ranges from 4.27% (Bitcoin) to 9.44% (NEO), indicating that cryptocurrencies with
    lower market capitalisation exhibit larger variability. Moreover, while the price
    returns of Bitcoin are negatively skewed suggesting that Bitcoin’s return distribution
    has a longer left tail over the common sample period, the opposite result holds
    for the price returns of all the altcoins. Nevertheless all cryptocurrency price
    returns exhibit high kurtosis and thus have heavy tails, with Bitcoin exhibiting
    the lowest and Ripple the highest excess kurtosis. Furthermore, the Jarque-Bera
    test confirms the departure from normality for all the cryptocurrency price return
    series.

- en: It is worth mentioning that in a study of the tail behaviour of the returns
    of Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin, using an extreme value
    analysis and estimating Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall as tail risk measures,
    Bitcoin Cash, which was more recently launched compared to the other cryptocurrencies,
    was found to have the highest potential gain and loss and to thus be the riskiest
    cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin and Litecoin were found to be the least risky cryptocurrencies,
    and hence position in these two could be viewed safer than in their counterparts
    ([Gkillas and Katsiampa](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_031), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_031)).
    These results indicated that more recently launched cryptocurrencies are riskier
    than cryptocurrencies that have been in existence for several years and seem to
    be relatively more mature. It is also worth mentioning that cryptocurrencies have
    much higher volatility and exhibit heavier tail behaviour than traditional currencies,
    and are therefore riskier than fiat currencies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The notion of market efficiency dates back to as early as in 1970s. A market
    in which prices always “fully reflect” all available information is called “informationally
    efficient” ([Fama](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_027), [1970](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_027)).
    There are three forms of informational efficiency, namely (i) weak form of efficiency,
    where prices reflect the information contained in the previous prices, (ii) semi-strong
    form of efficiency, where prices reflect all public information, and (iii) strong
    form of efficiency, if prices reflect all public and private information. Market
    efficiency is therefore related to the ability of a market to reflect the information
    in a quick and efficient manner. In an efficient market, asset prices are not
    predictable following a random walk, and the extent to which a market is efficient
    has been an important aspect of capital markets, since it affects investors’ profitability.
    For this reason, there is vast literature examining the efficiency of different
    financial markets. Since cryptocurrencies are primarily used for speculation purposes,
    several studies have explored the market efficiency of cryptocurrencies as well,
    even though the efficient market hypothesis could seem inappropriate to explain
    cryptocurrency prices because it assumes that prices always reflect and are driven
    by relevant information as well as that investors behave rational in terms of
    immediately incorporating all available information in an unbiased manner ([Brauneis
    and Mestel](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008)).
    Empirical tests of cryptocurrency market efficiency are therefore mostly related
    to testing for price predictability in terms of randomness, with the informational
    efficiency of cryptocurrency markets depending on several factors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Few such important factors affecting whether cryptocurrency markets appear to
    be informational efficient or not are related to the sample time period under
    investigation as well as the data and method employed. The results of a battery
    of robust tests, namely the Ljung–Box test, Runs tests, Bartels test, AVR test,
    BDS test and R/S Hurst, for the daily logarithmic price returns of Bitcoin over
    the period of the first six years since Bitcoin started being traded revealed
    that Bitcoin returns were not weakly efficient ([Urquhart](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_056),
    [2016](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_056)). When the sample was split into two equal
    subsample periods, the results for the first sub-sample were consistent with those
    for the whole sample period. However, the results of the Ljung-Box test and AVR
    test for the second sub-sample covering the period from 1^(st) August 2013 to
    31^(st) July 2016 indicated that Bitcoin is efficient in the latter period, and
    hence Bitcoin may becoming more efficient over time. Nevertheless, a power transformation
    of the Bitcoin price returns of the form <math altimg="../graphic/b_9783110660807-004_ineq_001.png"
    alttext=""><msubsup><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi
    mathvariant="italic">m</mi></mrow></msubsup></math>, where *m* is an odd integer,
    over the same period of time covering the first six years since Bitcoin started
    being traded results in the transformed Bitcoin returns to actually be efficient
    according to the results of several tests, including the Ljung–Box test, Runs
    tests, Bartels test, and BDS test, among others ([Nadarajah and Chu](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_047),
    [2017](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_047)). Moreover, the results of various long-range
    dependence estimators (including the Centred Moving Average-squared absolute fluctuation,
    Centred Moving Average-mean absolute fluctuation, Periodogram-Least Squares, Periodogram-Least
    Absolute Deviation) while allowing for time variation for the logarithmic price
    returns for a period spanning over the first seven years since Bitcoin was launched
    have also shown that the Bitcoin market is informational efficient ([Tiwari et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_054),
    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_054)). On the other hand, contradictory results
    to those listed above have been found for the logarithmic price returns over the
    time period from 1^(st) December 2010 to 30^(th) November 2017 due to the fact
    that the Bitcoin market exhibits long-term memory and a high degree of inefficiency
    ratio (defined as the percentage of inefficient windows among the total number
    of windows) as well as due to rejecting null hypotheses of randomness in most
    sub-periods ([Jiang et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_035), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_035)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, the Bitcoin market informational efficiency also depends on the
    data frequency under consideration, with the higher the data frequency, the lower
    the pricing efficiency being. More specifically, although there has been found
    some evidence of efficiency in the Bitcoin market at the daily level of data when
    testing the martingale hypothesis using different variance ratio tests, there
    are indications of informational inefficiency at higher data frequencies ([Zargar
    and Kumar](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_063), [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_063)).
    Moreover, even at intraday level (e. g., 15-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 45-min), the
    higher the data frequency, the lower the pricing efficiency is ([Sensoy](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_052),
    [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_052)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The degree of informational efficiency of cryptocurrency markets also depends
    on the market itself. For instance, there exists non-homogeneous informational
    inefficiency across Bitcoin markets in Europe, USA, Australia, Canada, and UK,
    as a result of different long memory estimates, with the considered Bitcoin markets
    being moderate to highly inefficient enabling investors to capture speculative
    profits ([Cheah et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_011), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_011)).
    Moreover, although it has been shown that both the Bitcoin markets in terms of
    US Dollars and Euros have become more informationally efficient over time at the
    intraday level since the beginning of 2016, the Bitcoin market in terms of US
    Dollars is slightly more efficient than the Bitcoin market in terms of Euros,
    with Bitcoin markets in terms of Euros therefore providing a more profitable trading
    environment at the intraday level ([Sensoy](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_052), [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_052)).

- en: In addition, the informational efficiency of cryptocurrency markets further
    depends on the cryptocurrency under examination. While most previous studies have
    mainly examined the efficiency of Bitcoin markets due to its dominance in the
    cryptocurrency markets, market inefficiencies exist not only for Bitcoin but also
    for altcoins. Although there is a heterogeneous pattern of inefficiency across
    the different cryptocurrencies and despite the fact that the degree of persistence
    indicating inefficiency changes over time for the different cryptocurrencies,

    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_059)) examined the semi-strong efficiency of
    daily Bitcoin price returns in the Bitstamp and Mt.Gox exchanges through an event
    study with monetary policy and Bitcoin news, and found that Bitcoin did not respond
    to monetary policy news and is therefore semi-strong form inefficient with regards
    to this kind of news, as a result of the absence of any kind of control from central
    banks on Bitcoin. However, when focusing on events that are related to features
    of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency was found to respond to negative events in both
    the Bitstamp and Mt.Gox markets, while it responded to positive news only in the
    Bitstamp market, indicating that Bitcoin has become more efficient over time in
    relation to its own events after the bankruptcy of Mt.Gox. Nevertheless, while
    studying the evolving predictability in the logarithmic price returns of Bitcoin,
    [Khuntia and Pattanayak](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_043) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_043))
    found evidence supporting the Adaptive Market Hypothesis, according to which markets
    evolve due to events and structural changes and adapt, suggesting that the market
    efficiency of Bitcoin varies in degree at different times and therefore evolves
    with time. Consequently, the existence of behavioural bias and occurrence of some
    events can change efficiency, enabling speculators to take advantage of such events
    at times, thus making it unrealistic to assume perfectly efficient or inefficient
    markets as per the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

    method employed, and form of efficiency under investigation, the informational
    efficiency of cryptocurrency markets seems to depend on several other factors,
    such as the liquidity, degree of maturity, size, and volatility of the market.
    More specifically, liquidity has a positive and significant impact on the informational
    efficiency of cryptocurrency markets suggesting that cryptocurrencies become more
    efficient as liquidity increases ([Brauneis and Mestel](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008),

    The market size as measured by market capitalisation has also been found to be
    positively related to efficiency ([Brauneis and Mestel](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008),
    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008)), while Bitcoin as the oldest, most mature,
    and most commonly used cryptocurrency is the most efficient one ([Brauneis and
    Mestel](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_008); [Caporale

    On the other hand, volatility has a negative effect in the informational efficiency
    of Bitcoin prices ([Sensoy](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_052), [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_052)).

    of the market, among others. However, the most efficient cryptocurrency is Bitcoin,

    traded over a decade ago, cryptocurrencies still constitute a relatively new asset
    class and are still rather in their infancy. As it is common for informational
    inefficiencies to exist in new and smaller equity markets ([Bekaert and Harvey](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_006),
    [2002](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_006)), the existence of long-term memory and inefficiency
    findings in cryptocurrency markets are not surprising. Moreover, due to these
    characteristics, cryptocurrency markets are frequently compared with emerging
    markets, which exhibit greater inefficiency compared to developed markets ([Bekaert

    and the lack of a reasonable pricing mechanism ([Jiang et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_035),

    section was widely accepted by academic financial economists. However, since then
    it has been frequently criticised, primarily due to the fact that asset prices
    are at least partially predictable. According to the survey by [Beechey et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_005)
    ([2000](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_005)), although the efficient market hypothesis
    “is the right place to start when thinking about asset price formation”, it “cannot
    explain some important and worrying features of asset market behaviour”. One such
    feature is related to the bubble behaviour followed by crashes that different
    assets may exhibit. The efficient market hypothesis assumes that the current prices
    of securities are close to their fundamental values and that investors are rational,
    implying that bubbles and crashes cannot occur ([Abreu and Brunnermeier](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_001),
    [2003](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_001)). However, throughout history there have
    existed several popular examples of bubbles followed by crashes, including the
    famous Dutch tulip mania in the 1630s as well as the Internet stock boom of the
    1990s.

    a bubble can be defined “as a sharp rise in price of an asset or a range of assets
    in a continuous process, with the initial rise generating expectations of further
    rises and attracting new buyers – generally speculators interested in profits
    from trading in the asset rather than its use of earning capacity”, with the rise
    being frequently “followed by a reversal of expectations and a sharp decline in
    price often resulting in a financial crisis”. Financial asset bubbles in particular
    are viewed as inflations of prices beyond expectations based on fundamental economic
    features only.

    news and events. Indeed, changes in asset prices originate from the collective

    [2000](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_036)). Interestingly, even though investors might
    realise that prices are in excess of fundamental values, they could conjecture
    that the bubble will continue to expand and yield large positive returns ([McQueen

    speculative bubbles are consistent with fully rational, informed behaviour ([Hamilton

    exhibit some similar features, such as extensive public and media interest and
    over-valuation compared to historical averages – features which have clearly been
    present in cryptocurrency markets. Moreover, despite the fact that there can be
    speculation without a bubble, a bubble cannot occur without speculation. Consequently,
    due to the extent of public and media attention, the fact that cryptocurrencies
    have experienced periods of rapid price appreciations followed by sharp declines
    as well as the extent of speculation in cryptocurrency markets, several studies
    have investigated whether cryptocurrency markets exhibit speculative bubbles.
    In an early study – long before the unprecedented cryptocurrency price appreciations
    that occurred in 2017, [Cheung et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_012) ([2015](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_012)),

    methodology to Bitcoin prices from the Mt. Gox exchange over the period 2010–2014,
    detected several short-lived bubbles as well as three large bubbles during the
    period 2011–2013 lasting between 66 and 106 days. The authors further found that
    the bursting of these large bubbles seems to coincide with certain major events
    that occurred in the exchange, namely an online attack leading to $8.75 million
    in Bitcoin being stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange in June 2011, the incident in
    which trading at Mt. Gox was suspended for two days in April 2013, as well as
    Mt. Gox’s decision to suspend all Bitcoin withdrawals on 7^(th) February 2014
    and to shut down its trading activities on 25^(th) February. On the other hand,
    [Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_019) ([2018b](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_019))
    investigated whether underlying fundamentals related to Bitcoin and Ether, such
    as the blockchain position, the hashrate, and liquidity as measured by the volume
    of daily transactions, can be designated as drivers of price growth that could
    generate the conditions and environment in which a pricing bubble could thrive
    over the period between 2009 and 2017\. In their study, it was found for Bitcoin
    that, although some periods where each of the fundamental drivers showed a bubble
    were identified, most bubbles were indicated as from the price alone, whereas
    for Ether, even scantier signals of bubbles, which were concentrated in the early
    2016 and mid-2017 periods, were observed. The authors concluded that, although
    Bitcoin has been in a bubble phase since its price exceeded the landmark of $1000,
    there is a lack of clear evidence of a persistent bubble in the Bitcoin and Ether
    markets, without this suggesting that their prices are correct, though. Bubbles
    were also identified in the more recent study of [Su et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_053)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_053)), which analysed Bitcoin prices in terms
    of both CNY and USD and found that exogenous shocks enable the outset of bubbles,
    with important financial crises causing long-term and large-scale bubbles while
    short-term bubbles being triggered by domestic economic events, and that bubbles
    burst as a result of authorities’ intervention, suggesting that governments can
    limit speculation in Bitcoin markets and stabilise its price.

    a bubble in Ripple once accounting for heavy-tails and liquidity risk, indicating
    technical advantages and reduced levels of speculation in Ripple compared to Bitcoin.

    been a subject of interest among academics for decades. Recently the literature
    on bubbles and crashes in cryptocurrency markets has started emerging as well.
    While the bubble behaviour in altcoin markets seems to depend on both the cryptocurrency
    and period under investigation, Bitcoin has exhibited several bubbles since its
    launch. The explanation to cryptocurrencies’ bubble behaviour lies merely in their
    very own nature: cryptocurrencies develop bubbles because they are simply objects
    of speculation without intrinsic value ([Cheung et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_012),
    [2015](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_012)). This fact has led to numerous bubbles of
    different magnitude with various incidents, such as online hacking attacks stealing
    Bitcoins and the decision of Chinese regulators to ban cryptocurrency trading,
    making them burst. Nevertheless, the risk-management implications are ambiguous
    since bubbles do not constitute a prerequisite for the occurrence of boom–bust
    episodes ([Fry](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_028), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_028)).'

- en: Financial time series, such as stock prices and exchange rates, often exhibit
    the phenomenon of volatility clustering, where large changes tend to be followed
    by large changes, of either sign, and small changes tend to be followed by small
    changes. Since various types of news and other exogenous shocks could have an
    impact on an asset’s price, the returns of financial assets tend to exhibit time-varying
    volatility, such that markets could be more tranquil during certain periods and
    more turbulent during others. Consequently, understanding and modelling time-varying
    volatility is of high importance in different areas, such as asset pricing, portfolio
    selection, and financial risk management. For instance, investors in stock markets
    are particularly interested in the volatility of stock prices, since higher levels
    of volatility could lead not only to huge gains but also to huge losses, therefore
    imposing larger risks. Volatility also has important implications for interval
    and density forecasting, since correct confidence intervals and density forecasts
    in the presence of time-varying volatility require time-varying confidence interval
    widths and time-varying density forecast spreads ([Diebold](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_023),

    In fact, the price volatility of cryptocurrencies is significantly higher than
    the volatility of widely used currencies and financial assets, making forecasting
    of cryptocurrencies’ prices a more challenging task compared to forecasting the
    prices of, e. g., exchange rates and stock indices. Many studies on the volatility
    of cryptocurrencies have employed Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity
    (GARCH) models, which are broadly applied in financial econometrics, mainly in
    modelling the volatility of stock prices and foreign exchange rates, as they are
    able to explain and forecast the volatility of financial time series, showing
    that cryptocurrency price volatility is significantly affected by both its own
    past shocks and past volatility.

    in contrast to what is frequently observed in financial returns, when studying
    the price volatility of Bitcoin at univariate level, there is no significant asymmetric
    effect between positive and negative past errors in the current levels of Bitcoin’s
    volatility, known as leverage effect, irrespective of the data frequency. Consequently,
    negative return shocks do not have a greater impact on the conditional volatility
    of Bitcoin than positive shocks of equal magnitude, as commonly witnessed in different
    financial markets. On the other hand, another interesting finding, which is similar
    to what is observed in several financial returns, though, is that Bitcoin’s volatility
    is best described by both a short-run and a long-run component ([Katsiampa](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_038),

    GARCH-type models, such as the simple GARCH, Exponential GARCH, GJR-GARCH, Asymmetric

    [2008](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_013)), was found to explain the Bitcoin price
    volatility better than other GARCH-type models, including models that allow for
    different responses of the volatility to positive and negative past shocks – i. e.,
    the Exponential GARCH, GJR-GARCH, and Asymmetric CGARCH models ([Katsiampa](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_038),

    forecasting performance for Bitcoin returns according to the root mean squared
    error (RMSE) when compared to several GARCH-type models under different error

    of the cryptocurrencies could depend not only on the cryptocurrency under investigation
    but also on the sample period, there are some findings that can be generalised.
    First of all, cryptocurrencies exhibit volatility clustering, irrespective of
    the data frequency (daily, intraday, or monthly). Secondly, most cryptocurrencies
    do not exhibit significant asymmetric effect between positive and negative past
    errors in the current levels of their price volatility. Thirdly, some cryptocurrencies
    exhibit structural breaks in the conditional variance. Moreover, cryptocurrencies
    display long-memory in the conditional variance, despite the fact that, after
    accounting for structural breaks, long memory in the mean and variance of cryptocurrencies
    decreases. Another interesting finding is that while Bitcoin’s volatility seems
    to be described by both a short-run and a long-run component, this does not seem
    to be true for altcoins, since the altcoins’ volatility seems to be better described
    by more simple GARCH-type models. However, it is worth noting that volatility
    is lower in more liquid cryptocurrency markets ([Wei](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_060),
    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_060)), and cryptocurrency investors and traders

    management.

    are subject to additional sources of risk including forks, price manipulation,

    In addition, despite the fact that cryptocurrencies constitute decentralised digital
    currencies, significant Bitcoin volatility has been found to be generated by decisions
    related to both adjusting interest rates and introducing quantitative easing made
    by the central banks of the US, EU, UK, and Japan, with decisions related to quantitative
    easing having been found to have generated the most significant influence ([Corbet

    times higher than that of Bitcoin; Ether constitutes the digital token of Ethereum,
    an open-source Blockchain-based platform featuring smart contracts, which is supported
    by several industry giants through the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance foundation;
    whereas Ripple has been adopted by banks as settlement infrastructure technology,
    as it connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates
    via the RippleNet, which aims to improve the speed of financial transactions,
    with payments settling in only four seconds. On the other hand, Lumen represents
    the digital coin of the Stellar network, which is an open source, distributed
    and community owned technology that processes financial transactions, with the
    platform aiming to connect banks, payment systems and people, while contributing
    to financial inclusion focusing on developing markets. Lumen can be used for fast
    mobile payments and micropayments with very small fees. Monero provides its users
    with untraceability of their operations, a feature that could attract people interested
    in evading law enforcement.

    influence their prices and stability ([Yi et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_062),
    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_062)), cryptocurrencies’ also have several similarities
    and it could be expected that the prices of Bitcoin and altcoins are interdependent,
    not only due to Bitcoin’s dominance within the market but also due to the fact
    that most altcoin orders are executed in Bitcoin. Indeed Bitcoin and altcoin markets
    are interdependent, with Bitcoin being the dominant contributor of return and
    volatility spillovers among cryptocurrencies ([Koutmos](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_045),
    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_045)), and cryptocurrency users therefore face

    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_031)). Moreover, the interdependencies between
    Bitcoin and altcoins are significantly stronger in the short-run than in the long-run,
    with macro-financial indicators influencing the price formation of altcoins in
    the long-run to a slightly greater extent than Bitcoin does ([Ciaian and Rajcaniova](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_014),

    also important to understand volatility co-movements and spillover effects among
    cryptocurrencies. Volatility spillovers are commonly observed in the behaviour
    of financial assets, and comprehending covariances and correlations is of paramount
    importance to investors who are interested in understanding the risk of their
    portfolios ([Coudert et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_021), [2015](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_021)),
    since high levels of volatility interlinkages can limit the benefits of diversification.
    Understanding volatility co-movements and spillovers in cryptocurrency markets
    can assist market participants with improving their knowledge of the information
    transmission mechanisms and interdependencies within cryptocurrency markets, therefore
    enabling them make more informed decisions as well as adjust their portfolios
    accordingly.

    after December 2016 ([Yi et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_062), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_062)).
    It has been shown that irrespective of the data frequency (daily or intraday),
    the conditional covariances of cryptocurrencies are significantly affected by
    cross products of past error terms and previous covariance terms while also capturing
    asymmetric effects of both good and bad news, and hence significant volatility
    co-movements between cryptocurrencies and time-varying conditional correlations
    which are mostly positive exist ([Aslanidis et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_002),
    [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_002); [Katsiampa](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_039),

    Consequently, conditional correlations between cryptocurrencies do not remain
    constant but rather behave differently over different time periods. Nevertheless,
    when comparing conditional correlations between Bitcoin, Dash, Monero, and Ripple,
    correlations between cryptocurrencies and Monero are found to be more stable across
    time compared to the correlations of the other pairs of cryptocurrencies, whereas
    the most variable correlation is found between Ripple and Dash ([Aslanidis et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_002),
    [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_002)). Moreover, the cryptocurrencies’ conditional
    variance, covariance, and correlation plots exhibit several spikes indicating
    that they seem to have been susceptible to various news related to cryptocurrencies,
    such as Chinese authorities shutting down China-based cryptocurrency exchanges.

    volatility spillover effects. Interestingly, though, not only Bitcoin spillovers
    over altcoins. Instead, there are bidirectional spillovers between cryptocurrency
    markets, even though cryptocurrencies with higher capitalisation are more likely
    to spread volatility shocks to others ([Yi et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_062),
    [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_062)). [Katsiampa et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_042)

    and correlations between three pairs of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin-Ether,
    Bitcoin-Litecoin, and Ether-Litecoin, and found evidence of bi-directional shock
    transmission effects between Bitcoin and both Ether and Litecoin, and uni-directional
    shock spillovers from Ether to Litecoin, as well as bi-directional volatility
    spillover effects between all the three pairs.

    Moreover, in terms of selecting between naïve (using equal weights) and optimal
    (Markowitz) diversification in portfolios consisting of cryptocurrencies only,
    there is very little difference in performance between the two types of diversification,
    supporting the findings of ([DeMiguel et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_022), [2007](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_022))
    that naïve diversification is as good, if not better, than optimal diversification
    ([Platanakis et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_051), [2018](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_051)).

    mean and variance equation. Despite the fact that Bitcoin still remains the dominant
    cryptocurrency, there are bidirectional spillovers between cryptocurrency markets.
    Understanding the degree of connectedness and market spillover effects is of great
    importance in order for cryptocurrency users and traders to make more informed
    decisions with regards to appropriate trading strategy selection and risk management,
    especially since cryptocurrency users face undifferentiated risks.

    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies not being correlated with financial assets

    being isolated from other markets, with no specific asset playing a dominant role
    in influencing cryptocurrency market. Interestingly, cryptocurrencies are uncorrelated
    with traditional asset classes both in normal times and in periods of financial

    [2017](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_007)). For instance, although an early study assessing
    whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge and safe haven for major world stock indices,
    bonds, oil, gold, the general commodity index and the US dollar index, found that
    overall Bitcoin is a poor hedge, is appropriate merely for diversification purposes,
    and can only serve as a strong safe haven against weekly extreme down movements
    in Asian stocks ([Bouri et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_007), [2017](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_007)),
    some more recent studies have found that, by adding Bitcoin, the portfolio performance
    improves, even though this is primarily due to the increase in returns than in
    the reduction of volatility ([Kajtazi and Moro](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_037),
    [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_037)), that a short position in Bitcoin allows
    hedging the risk of investment against various financial assets and that hedging
    strategies involving gold, oil, emerging stock markets and Bitcoin reduce considerably
    a portfolio’s risk, in comparison to a portfolio composed of gold, oil and stocks
    from emerging stock only ([Guesmi et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_032), [2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_032)).
    Bitcoin can be also used as a hedge against stocks in the Financial Times Stock
    Exchange Index, but also as a hedge against the American dollar in the short-term
    ([Dyhrberg](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_025), [2016](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_025)).

    found that Bitcoin volatility is negatively related to US stock market volatility,
    indicating that Bitcoin can act as a safe-haven. On the other hand, [Urquhart
    and Zhang](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_058) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_058)),
    who assessed the relationship between Bitcoin and different currencies at the
    hourly frequency concluded that Bitcoin can act as an intraday hedge for the Swiss
    Franc, Euro and GBP, but acts as a diversifier for the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar and Japanese yen. The latter study also found that Bitcoin is a safe haven
    during periods of extreme market turmoil for the Canadian dollar, Swiss Franc
    and GBP. It is also worth noting that Bitcoin futures cannot mitigate the risk
    inherent in the underlying spot market and therefore are not an effective hedging
    tool ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_018), [2018a](#b_9783110660807-004_ref_018)).

    provide investors with such an alternative mainly due to the high returns they
    can offer. Consequently, understanding cryptocurrencies’ relationship with other
    financial assets is of high importance to investors in order to make more informed
    decisions. Cryptocurrency markets have very low correlations with mainstream assets

- en: In this chapter, we considered several financial characteristics of cryptocurrency
    markets. As discussed, cryptocurrencies are characterised by heavy tail behaviour,
    very high volatility, persistence, large abrupt price swings, and vulnerability
    to speculative bubbles, among other properties, all of which lead cryptocurrencies
    to resemble more financial assets rather than fiat currencies. Moreover, cryptocurrency
    markets exhibit some informational inefficiencies, which, however, depend on several
    factors. Finally, cryptocurrencies are highly connected to each other but isolated
    from mainstream assets, with their hedging and safe haven properties varying over
    time.

    ago, cryptocurrencies seem to constitute a different type of asset class which
    seems to still be in its infancy. Cryptocurrencies are primarily used for speculation
    purposes instead of as a traditional medium of exchange, despite the fact that
    they hold high investment risk and despite concerns about risks associated with
    their price fluctuations raised by economists and financial institutions, with
    their price discovery being driven by uninformed investors.
