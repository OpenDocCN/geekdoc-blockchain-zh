    task. Knowing that the world is facing development in the numerical aspects and
    multiplicity of digital data that are normally produced by both consumers and
    technologies, dealing with this huge amount of data and finding the finest way
    to store, process, and organize it is necessary. This is the point where blockchain
    comes into the picture by providing significant inputs as it is the decentralized
    system for private data. Certainly, several industry experts are considering blockchain
    and its welfare for many improvements in different fields. Big Data is the recklessly
    rising sector in the ecosphere as every industry wants to get an understanding
    of the customs arrangements of their customers, where Big Data mentions huge datasets
    that are examined to divulge fundamental outlines using progressive statistical
    representations and data mining. The data produced is of petabytes range and when
    we are dealing with such a large range of datasets, problems related to it arise
    and not only collection of data is focused but security measures are also given
    extra importance, and proper care of produced data is taken so that no malicious
    action takes place.

    rate. Both have been developed separately and have largely been applied in various
    industries independently from each other. Blockchain applications have been centric
    towards cryptocurrency and bitcoins with their distributed ledger technology (DLT)
    attracting both tech enthusiasts and potential investors in this new area of business.
    It has further expanded into other fields such as banking and supply chain management,
    finding use in all spheres of life. Blockchain technology truly can disrupt the
    current economic system of the world by its decentralized structure and removal
    of the third party. Big Data has become a buzzword in recent years with data multiplying
    like never before. Its applications cannot be limited to just one field as data
    is utilized and generated everywhere. From sensors to social media websites, big
    data is everywhere around us. Challenges arise when it comes to utilization and
    analysis as it holds the key to vital information. This information invariably
    proves to be valuable to businesses and governments alike, studying the performance
    of their products and services.

    way. It is safe to say that it has covered multiple and a variety of spheres ranging
    from the economy [[2](#r2)] to healthcare. The history of how blockchain came
    to be can be credited to Satoshi Nakamoto, who outlined the basic workings of
    the technology and since then it has continued being developed for a variety of
    applications. Ethereum took things a step further and developed the concept of
    smart contracts. Blockchain is often referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology
    (DLT). A simple way to look at it would be to take the example of a Google Doc
    or a Wikipedia Page. Here, our document is distributed amongst many and every
    person can make a change in real-time and any updates are visible and transparent
    to all. Since blockchain is based upon DLT and everyone has access to the ledger,
    the information is transparent thus increasing accountability [[3](#r3)].

    there are no transaction costs involved. Infrastructural costs to maintain the
    system exist but any user making any trade will not face any additional costs.
    This happens because blockchain cuts off any third parties owing to its decentralized
    system. This will have serious consequences in the future economic system considering
    that many businesses currently make a profit by being the third party connecting
    the consumer to the product. For example, a yearly subscription to any magazine
    will stop being popular as the user can just pay a very small amount per article
    considering no additional transaction costs will be levied.

    ‘blocks’ are digital pieces of information stored in a public database ‘the chain.’
    Despite its growing significance in today’s world, blockchain is not a new technology.
    It is in fact an amalgamation of three proven and existing technologies [[5](#r5)],

    network is nothing, but a system of nodes connected and interconnected with each
    other. Each node is a computer network that can either take any input or perform
    functions and send its output. There is no hierarchy among different nodes and
    there is a uniform topology with the work being divided equally.

    and one private. The public keys are as the name suggests public and distributed
    amongst the members while the private key is possessed by a few. A public key
    can encrypt the message in a manner that only the person holding the private key
    can read it. The person possessing the private key can create a digital signature
    so that anyone with the relevant public key can validate the information.

    and provides better security and accountability. Transparency is an obvious consequence
    of the decentralized system. While it protects the private information of the
    users, the transactions are still made public making it a very safe system to
    work with. The basic mechanism behind the working of a blockchain can be broken

    Blockchain completely focuses on distributed ledger systems, this decentralized
    network topology gives priority to the security systems on a higher level. Every
    transaction that is made *via* the consumer is stored in individual blocks. These
    blocks are created for storing the information and whenever a new transaction
    is made a new block is formed slowly this results in a chain of blocks and hence
    the technology is named BLOCKCHAIN. The transactions related information that
    is stored in the blocks must be validated by the user every time for maintaining
    the proper network and enabling efficient functioning. Not only the information
    related to the transactions but also the timestamp recording is done in a tamper-proof
    way. A single change that is made in the data is recorded with the proper timestamp,
    which is then unalterable, thereby increasing the transparency of the system.
    That is why blockchain is a secured system that helps in the proper preservation
    of data uprightness. Smart contracts [[27](#r27), [28](#r28)] are a feature of
    Blockchain technology, this functionality is greatly important in spontaneous
    resolving of the transactions in a network.

    but the network it creates *i.e*. decentralized network is efficient in permitting
    admittance to multiple operators. Several parties performing transactions normally
    accumulate the transactional info in diverse ledgers. The parties that are involved
    in the transactions can be made to work on one sole network *via* Blockchain.
    Transactions that are taking place are recorded inside the network which is operational
    for the same and can be easily validated by the users of the party. As all the
    information is stored in the blocks formed from the blockchain hence it will help
    in easy access to the details stored within them. The design of the blockchain
    is done in such a way that it can help users to sight past transactions smoothly
    and can examine the trajectory of the transaction that is made.

    is in the banking sector in Japan. Around 50 Banks [[26](#r26), [30](#r30)] made
    an association and prepared an agreement with “Ripple” [[31](#r31)]. Here, Ripple
    is an open tracked network that is constructed based on the technology named Blockchain.
    Internationally, Ripple ranked third in marketplace capitalization. This coalition
    arrived with the commitment to practice blockchain with big data for the menace-free
    and lower price transactions. It was made promising by refurbishing the outmoded
    Banking archetypal. The conventional archetypal had several parties that are involved
    and had further risk features in them. To plug in the menace and contrivance control
    themes, banks had to suffer by paying supplementary costs. The cost incurred because
    of this could have been saved by using networks of blockchain. The partnership

    Blockchain is the ruling technology of recent years, it is a database that simplifies
    database management and provides transparency about each record that is maintained.
    Blockchain makes it highly secure database technology, every record that is created
    in the database is known as a block and each block has details of the transaction
    *i.e*. made by the user. This decentralized network helps in managing and analyzing
    the data effectively. The record that is created includes the date of the transaction

    the right to control the entered data, hence the integrity of the system is maintained.
    Continuous checks are made when the system is on any network. Every machine on
    the network has the same data on it, the data that is corrupted cannot come in
    the chain that is built. For instance let us assume the healthcare sector, wherein
    a hospital the data of the patients are maintained and it is ensured that the
    data which is collected is secured, not only this healthcare sector has to focus
    on updating the data related to each customer so that single detail about the
    health condition of the patient is missed. Now if the healthcare databases are
    placed on the network of blockchain then any employee can access the network easily
    and can update the information regarding the patient, it is also focused that
    the data source is kept unchangeable. Due to poor supervision of the data in the
    healthcare sector the risk increases, as this can lead to mishandling or poor
    diagnosis for the patient also if the proper track of the details related to the
    patient is not taken then the information related to tests can get misplaced.
    All sorts of risks can be easily avoided with the help of blockchain, the Fig.
    (**[5](#f5)**) shown explains the areas that are covered to keep records.

    As data keeps on increasing the chain is formed, and for creating the chain and
    linking each block there is a great need for block headers. These block headers
    help in recognizing the sequence of each data block, also every block will have
    a hash of the previous block so that the linkage of each block can be easily done.
    The advantage of having hashes in the system is to provide immutability, *i.e*.
    once a block is created it cannot be changed. How the data blocks are linked to
    each other in the system is shown in the figure below. Each block contains data
    in it followed by a hash and the block number. Hash is the address of the next
    block, provided to maintain the linkage of each block in the system, explained

    Although blockchain is known for its feature of immutability what if there is
    a great need to add or subtract data or a block from the chain, for changing the
    data there will be a need to change the hash address of the block. If the data
    of any block is changed, it will affect the data in the next block and so on the
    chain formed will get disturbed. Hence, the regeneration of hashes for each block

    in the market. It is giant, deals with tremendous amounts of data, and has speed
    as a necessity in all transactions. When it comes to big data, blockchain, AI
    is one of the first adopters and experimenters of possibilities in the financial
    industry. Efficiency is a critical matter, and blockchain allows the way for the
    transaction of these funds globally. Ledgers have changed the financial industry
    that’s one of the reasons that this sector is taken up by the blockchain. Consumer
    expectations are changing, they want a better experience, they want their needs
    to be matched, that's when AI is also used. This helps in offering better services
    and it can be done at a much faster pace. The financial industry is producing
    lots and lots of data every single second with the transaction that is made. Several
    factors play an important role when it comes to the financial industry. Our financial
    lives are changing the acceleration of digital transformation, customer and data-driven
    financial services are key to these changes transforming financial services with
    blockchain and big data. When the customer’s integrated authentication information
    is registered with the digital identity, it is lately propagated throughout blockchain
    enabling convenient and secure user authentication for a wide variety of services.
    Using blockchain-based digital points, users can make app-to-app payments, can
    transfer these points overseas in real-time, and can collect those points *via*
    ATM, because all these transactions are enabled through blockchain with increased
    limits and safety. Integration of scattered customer financial information such
    as spending, investments, and assets can now be shown in an app and financial
    information for analysis is de-identified and is managed securely through Blockchain.
    It also has AI virtual assistant which can recommend the virtual product and customers
    can register their recommended product at once. Next, the digitalization of finance
    also changes the financial environment, AI virtual assistant allows financial
    institutions to provide faster customer services. It also makes it easy for customers
    to submit documents, and while making insurance claims customers can authenticate
    themselves easily, and the data gets directly transferred from one place to another
    through blockchain.

    is introduced. The technology present at the time of the industrial age was machined,
    people at that time were trying to put their hands into the mechanization of systems
    so that the information from the environment can be recorded efficiently by slowly
    moving towards how to efficiently manage every single connection between the machines.
    Presently, almost every device is connected through the network.

    [47](#r47)] and fusing them to form a new technology named BioT. This technology
    will help the customer by providing a decentralized network that collaborates
    with IoT and can help in resolving the issues by adopting peer to peer network.
    Millions of data are generated and are shared between the devices which lower
    down the cost and assign computational and storage requirements crossways several
    diplomacies, thereby, preventing the network from failure.

    to the security of the system, IoT when focuses the aspect of security [[48](#r48)],
    does not only focuses on protecting the sensitive data but includes many other
    things in it. When blockchain and IoT get combined, they lead to a solution that
    can easily maintain the privacy of the network, this is done by asking for validation
    each time the data is accessed by an individual, the agreement has to pass for
    processing each transaction, this can help in avoiding deceiving and robbery.

- en: Blockchain is in its emerging phase and has got hyped in a very short time.
    When the technology will develop further, more tangible use cases can be acknowledged
    and discovered, and big data management will become easier with the involvement
    of blockchain in it. Large amounts of data with massive datasets must be handled
    properly as storing this data, its manipulation, and its distribution are the
    major challenges for handling such large amounts of data. All these problems related
    to big data can be solved using blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only apprehension is that blockchain presentation in this respect will be
    exclusive to chase, which is due to data storing *i.e*. done on the block. Blocks
    present in blockchain deal with comparatively minor quantities of data equated
    to the huge capacities of data composed every second for the technologies like
    big data. But it is dealt with intuitively by creating a chain of blocks containing
    the actual data, blockchain thereby provides the platform for handling such large
    amounts of data efficiently.
