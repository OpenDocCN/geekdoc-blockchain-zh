- en: The focus of our discussion so far throughout this book has been centered around
    the compliance and operational considerations related to cryptocurrency and digital
    asset-related investments. Underlying these cryptocurrency investments are thriving
    technological ecosystems. It is useful to have a basic understanding of key aspects
    of these technologies in order to be able to better evaluate cryptocurrency and
    digital asset investments. As such, in this chapter we will provide a background
    in some of the key technological systems and architecture underlying the crypto
    and digital asset spaces. To begin with, we will provide an overview of distributed
    ledger technology layers.

- en: As we outlined in Chapter [1](513667_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml), not all distributed
    ledger technologies (DLT) are blockchain, but all blockchains are examples of
    DLT. Systems based on DLT are made up of three different layers. A layer can be
    thought of a node of the network that can have its own implementation based on
    the specific DLT systems technical specifications. Each layer has ***components***
    and each component is made up of ***processes***.[¹](#FPar4)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first and foundational DLT layer is the ***protocol layer***. This layer
    can be thought of as the technical rules by which the DLT system will function.
    The two components of the protocol layer are the ***Genesis Component*** and the
    ***Alteration Component***. The Genesis Component contains that the initial code
    and technical architecture for the DLT system. The Alteration Component details
    the rules by which the DLT protocol will change over time. The information contained
    in this component includes governance processes detailing the methods by which
    decisions may be made, and how they are implemented.

    (i.e. – data) that is moving through the DLT system. This includes information
    about the relationship between the technical system rules (i.e. – the protocol
    layer) and the way the system rules are implemented (i.e. – the network layer).
    Specifically the two components of the operations component are the Operations
    Component and the Journal Component. The Operations Component consists of the
    processes that outline the data sources and methodology utilized to establish
    and modify records. Smart contract may be included in this layer.[³](#FPar4) The
    Journal Component focuses on the specific information contained in records. In
    a blockchain DLT the Journal Component could be considered to outline what data
    is contained in the blocks.

    to gain the right to validate the transactions in a block. In the early days of
    the crypto space, individuals could mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin from
    home computers. Today the mining space for the larger market capitalization coins
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has become highly competitive and it is no longer
    practicable for individual users to mine these high profile coins. The space has
    become so competitive on a global scale that even once established large miners
    with a great deal of stand-alone computing power have difficulty competing. To
    overcome these challenges, large groups of miners have combined their resources
    into what are known as ***mining pools***.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before proceeding we should clarify the difference between a validator and a
    delegator. A ***validator***, also referred to as a ***validator node*** or ***full
    node***, is the entity verifying a transaction. While all validators are necessarily
    miners by default, in blockchains such as Bitcoin there is not a pecuniary incentive
    for simply being a validator however, it does improve network security. Anyone
    with a storage device with enough space can run a full node.[^(10)](#FPar4) Due
    to the lack of financial incentives associated with running a full node exclusively
    most validators running full nodes are miners or groups of miners known as ***mining
    pools***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Validators are granted special rights over regular coin holders. There is however,
    the risk that validators could abuse these privileges and harm the overall blockchain
    network. One example of such harmful actions could be ***downtime***. If a validator
    node goes down transactions cannot be signed by the validator and this can lead
    to overall network congestion. Validators can experience downtime for a variety
    of reasons including hardware failure or if a node gets out of synchronization
    with the blockchain. Another example of a negative validator action in a PoS protocol
    is known as ***double signing***. This is when a validator submits two different
    messages that are signed for a single block. This can occur when a validator maintains
    a highly available backup entity, often used to combat downtime issues, but this
    backup is running at the same time as the primary and then a double signing can
    occur.[^(11)](#FPar4) Double signing is also referred to as ***double spending***.
    Double signing can be especially detrimental for a chain because it hampers the
    ability to reach consensus for a transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When validator actions lead to issues such as downtime and double signing a
    penalty is often applied by the protocol known as ***slashing***. Different blockchain
    protocols penalize violations with different slashing penalties. Furthermore to
    discourage particularly harmful actions such as double signing, some blockchain
    protocols such as Polkadot and eth2 employ a slashing mechanism known as ***correlated
    slashing***. Correlated slashing involves a scaled slashing penalty system whereby
    the penalties associated with negative validator behavior increase based on the
    percentage of total validators that are engaged in the negative behavior at a
    single time.[^(12)](#FPar4) The more validators that are involved, the higher
    the penalties.

    miners compete against each other to validate transactions by solving complex
    mathematical problems. Whichever miner solves the problems the fastest wins the
    ability to validate the transaction and earn the reward. Bitcoin employs the PoW
    model. Due to Bitcoin’s popularity and first-mover position in the crypto space
    initially PoW models were the most prevalent model employed in the crypto space
    however, a transition away from PoW models has been undertaken by certain crypto

    on the ETH blockchain. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin’s cap of 21 million coins,
    Ethereum does not have a hard cap although caps have been proposed historically.
    These issues have led Ethereum to evolve over time with a series of protocol upgrades
    and changes including the ***Berlin hard fork*** which focused on the optimization
    of gas fees among other items.

- en: Ethereum undertook a project known as ***Casper*** that had a goal of eventually
    converting Ethereum from a PoW model, known as Ethereum 1.0, into a PoS model,
    also called ***Ethereum 2.0***. Under the ETH PoS model users will need to stake
    at least 32 ETH for the right to verify transactions in a block. The Casper project
    has many different associated projects and implementation phases. Specifically,
    the stage of the Casper project that involves the upgrade from Ethereum 1.0 to
    Ethereum 2.0 is known as the ***Serenity*** upgrade. As part of this transition
    a new Ethereum blockchain was launched in December 2020 that was called the ***Beacon
    Chain***.[^(13)](#FPar4) This process is also referred to under the term ***sharding***
    because a new shard of the original Ethereum blockchain was created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to understand how the deployment of the Ethereum 2.0 will work we must
    also understand other related Casper projects. One project has been researched
    into the ***Casper CBC*** (Correct-By-Consensus) protocol that is a family of
    PoS models.[^(14)](#FPar4) A related research project is the ***Casper FFG***
    (Friendly Finality Gadget) protocol that proposed a combined PoW and PoS solution
    however, the exact implementation of this protocol is still being evaluated.[^(15)](#FPar4)
    The Casper FFG is not the only ***finality gadgets*** under development and this
    broader finality gadget concept plays an important part in the Serenity transition
    from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 because they employ the finality concept of
    the Casper algorithm to ensure that Ethereum 1.0 blocks can be fed in effectively
    an immutable way into the new Beacon Chain.[^(16)](#FPar4) The process of combining
    the old Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0 blockchains is referred to as ***the docking*** or
    ***the merge***. Subsequent to this process further upgrades to Ethereum 2.0 are
    scheduled including the implementation of ***shard chains*** in 2022\. Shard chains
    are a multi-phase upgrade to make it easier to run an ETH node and improve overall
    scalability and capacity by spreading the network's load across 64 new chains.[^(17)](#FPar4)

    of upgrades, such as the ***Altair*** 2021 upgrade, and Ethereum’s 11th backward-incompatible
    system-wide upgrade, also called a hard fork, called the ***London hard fork***.[^(18)](#FPar4)
    These upgrades were not universally accepted by all the Ethereum market participants
    and have been met by some pushback from miners in particular. One feature of the
    upgrade will be the beginning of what is known as ***Ethereum’s Ice Age*** through
    the activation of a difficulty mechanism, known as ***Ethereum Improvement Proposal
    (EIP-3554)*** or ***Ethereum’s Difficulty Bomb***, that will significantly increase
    the complexity of PoW puzzles that miners would be required to solve, thus slowing
    the speed at which block can be mined and encourage a faster the transition to
    a PoS model for miners.[^(19)](#FPar4) The detonation of the Difficulty Bomb was
    most recently anticipated to take place in December 2021 but has been delayed
    three previous times in October 2017 through the ***Byzantium upgrade***, in February
    2019 via the ***Constantinople fork***, in January 2020 through the ***Muir Glacer
    upgrade***, when the Ice Age was delayed by four million blocks. As another example
    of pushback against the ETH 2.0 upgrade, the London hard fork contains a controversial
    proposal known as ***EIP-1559*** that was protested by miners because it contained
    a fee burn ETH buyback mechanism that negatively impacted the revenue that miners
    could earn.[^(20)](#FPar4) Ultimately the docking process, also called the merge,
    was anticipated to be completed in 2019 but likely won’t completed until sometimes
    in 2022.

    blockchains have different targets for the average block time. For example, the
    expected block time in Bitcoin is 10 minutes while in the Ethereum block time
    is between 10 and 19 seconds.[^(34)](#FPar4) Block time is not fixed however and
    can vary based on a number of different factors such as miner’s computing power
    and the demand for mining rewards based on cryptocurrency prices.

    the PoW model should step in to increase the difficulty required to compute the
    correct ***hash***, a series of numbers and letters, that solves the PoW mathematical
    puzzle. In some cases however, miners have been able to mine faster than they
    should have according to the difficulty that was supposed to be set by the algorithms.
    For example, in May 2020 Bitcoin miners were usually mining approximately six
    blocks per hour but then one day miners were able to mine four blocks in only
    46 seconds.[^(35)](#FPar4) While cases like this represent anomalies in standard
    block time variance, they are monitored by individuals such as Bitcoin researchers
    to determine the appropriateness of the difficulty algorithm at any point in time.

- en: A trend that has become increasingly popular in the cryptocurrency space is
    known as yield farming. ***Yield farming*** refers to the process by which the
    owner of a cryptocurrency will lend out that currency in order to earn a return.
    There are different types of yield farming. In its most simplest form a retail
    investor or fund manager makes a direct purchase of a cryptocurrency such as Etherium
    (ETH). The purchasing party could simply hold on to these crypto coins. An alternative
    would be for them to lend them to a third party. In exchange for lending out the
    coins the lender (i.e. – the original purchaser) would receive interest. This
    interest is typically quoted as an annual yield. Yield farming is typically classified
    as a DeFI application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also look at the other side of the transaction from the borrower’s perspective.
    Similar to most loan and margin type transactions in a yield farming transaction
    the borrower would typically have to put up some kind of collateral.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yield farming is sometimes confused with another related term called ***liquidity
    mining***. Under liquidity mining coins are not learnt out for an annual interest
    rate but instead they are deposited into a smart contract on a blockchain project
    network. This process is also called ***staking***. The benefit this affords to
    the blockchain network is to provide it with increased liquidity. In return for
    staking coins on a blockchain network the lender, or liquidity provider as they
    may be called, is typically awarded a special type of network token. These tokens
    typically have governance related features and are sometimes referred to as ***governance
    tokens***. Holders of governance tokens have special voting rights related to
    future network activity and protocols. Additionally, holders of these special
    network tokens may also earn fees collected from each trade involving the project
    coins.[^(36)](#FPar4)

    This is also simply sometimes referred to as ***dual farming***. Under this model
    when users stake a blockchain native token then they can farm two different tokens
    instead of one under traditional single yield farming programs.[^(37)](#FPar4)

- en: '***Yield staking***, also simply referred to as ***staking***, refers to the
    process by which people contribute a pre-determined amount of a specific cryptocurrency
    for a reward. Staking can be thought of as a way to earn passive income on crypto
    holdings similar to the way someone would earn interest on a bank savings account.
    For this reason, yield staking is also called ***crypto rental income***. There
    are two categories of staking. The first category is known as ***on-chain staking***.
    The term ***on-chain*** refers to transactions that are complete when they are
    confirmed on the blockchain on which they reside. For this reason on-chain transactions
    are also called ***blockchain*** ***transaction***. On-chain staking is utilized
    for ***Proof of Stake (PoS) model*** cryptocurrencies, a concept we introduced
    earlier in this chapter.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key goal of the on-chain staking process is to improve security of the blockchain.
    To understand how this works we can consider the example of the on-chain staking
    in the Tezos blockchain. In Tezos there are validator nodes that validate transactions.
    For reference, in Tezos jargon the process of signing and appending transaction
    blocks is referred to as ***baking***. Tezos utilizes a type of PoS model referred
    to as a ***Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS)***. Under this model, Tezos token (XTZ)
    holders can stake on-chain to delegate their validation rights to other token
    holders (i.e. – validators). These individuals are known as delegators. It should
    be emphasized that delegators are not transferring custody of their tokens to
    validators but merely their validation rights. A unique feature of Tezos is that
    delegators delegate their whole account holdings, while other on-chain staking
    arrangements may allow for only partial account delegation staking.[^(38)](#FPar4)
    In return the delegators earn interest minus the associated validators fees. As
    of May 2021, the interest earned for staking Tezos was approximately 6%.[^(39)](#FPar4)
    After a delegation has been made, under Tezos the delegator can redeem their tokens
    at any time with no waiting period whereas other PoS/LPoS blockchains may implement
    ***freezing mechanisms*** that require the delegator to wait before redeeming
    their tokens back. For example, the Cosmos PoS blockchain requires a 21 day period,
    known as the ***unbonding period***, for the delegators Cosmos token (ATOM) stake
    to be returned to their wallet.[^(40)](#FPar4)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second category of staking is ***off-chain*** ***staking***. The term ***off-chain***
    refers to transactions that happen outside of the blockchain. Off-chain transaction
    frameworks are commonly utilized by decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs)
    whereby the investors and the exchange coordinate the terms of a crytpo transactions
    outside of the blockchain (i.e. – off-chain) and then the actual crypto transaction
    occurs on the blockchain (i.e. – on-chain).

    ledger (DLT) technology. It began with an overview of the three different DLT
    layers. As part of this discussion the elements of each layer including components
    and protocols. Next, the concept of blockchain layers was introduced. This discussion
    included an overview of proposal for different ways in which blockchain layers
    should be categorized as well as an overview of the Hyperledger project. We then
    proceeded to discuss cryptocurrency mining. As part of this discussion an overview
    of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) consensus models was included.
    Consensus model vulnerabilities including 51% attacks, Sybil attacks**,** and
    Eclipse attacks were also discussed. The chapter concluded with a discussion of
    yield farming, liquidity mining and yield staking. In the next chapter we will
    discuss cryptocurrency compliance and operations-related case studies.
