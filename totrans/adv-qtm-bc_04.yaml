    that are encrypted, and here distributed database is required for the purpose
    of transaction, contract, and independent record. It is therefore a digital ledger
    and can be reachable in different platforms for different financial activities
    and services. It is supported by healthy digital currency systems like bitcoin
    transactions and does not depend on any third party systems. Blockchain supports
    the multiple numbers of shared copies, and it works in a same database. Very recently
    blockchain was considered as an important subfield of information technology.
    It is therefore treated as a tool, technique, as well as procedure for financial
    management. This chapter is based on existing literature on blockchain with basics
    and special focus on the issues and limitations. This chapter highlights the scenario
    of blockchain technology in India with opportunities, companies, and scenario
    of manpower availability and potentiality.

- en: Blockchain Technology is the encrypted and distributed database connected with
    the transaction, contract, and depends on different independent record. Blockchain
    is the digital ledger and a particular place is being used to store data. Blockchain
    is strengthening the financial segment and activities for proper digital currency
    like bitcoin transactions. Blockchain Technology is dedicated in tangible and
    intangible asset management, and here data can be tracked and recorded in a particular
    network and ledger (Chattu et.al., 2019). Blockchain technology supports registered
    members immediately, and that can be shared, and offer completely transparent
    information. Blockchain is needful in tracking the orders, payments, accounts,
    as well as production. Transaction details can be identified of the end users
    using blockchain therefore it is emerging in diverse areas viz. business and commerce,
    education and training, health and medical systems, government and administration,
    entertainment, banking and trade, etc. It is a type of fraud resistant system
    and gives transparent financial services than traditional business processes.
    Like other Information Technology components, blockchain technology also been
    increased and rising its applications in other areas and sector. Satoshi Nakamoto
    devised an immutable ledger of transactions that chains together blocks of data
    using digital cryptography to solve the double-spending problem associated with
    digital currencies. Blockchain Technology allows participants to do the business
    who may not known to each other but able in safe and secure business. The blockchain
    is responsible in identification of the participants including validates the transactions
    and also ensure that everyone follow the norms. Blockchain Technology and its
    basic advantages is depicted in Fig 1\. The Blockchain Technology has several
    issues and challenges and in this regard country to country such issues are different.
    As far as India is concerned there are certain issues in regard to Blockchain
    Technology such as implementation and execution ranging from laws and regulations,
    norms and guidelines, financial aspects, and so on. Fig 1 depicted the basic advantages
    and benefits of Blockchain Technology at a glance (Chen, G., et.al., 2018).

    and challenges in several aspects. The technology is being used for the recoding
    of bitcoin transaction with international network of the systems and computers.
    Here both private and public companies are using Blockchain Technology, and according
    to a study it has noted that 56% organizations are moving for their business growth
    using blockchain ([Williams, 2019](#r28)). In Health Informatics practice Indian
    Government is driving more and involved with several initiative and in this regard
    Blockchain Technology is applicable. For the low income family massive investment
    can be noted by the Government and here Blockchain implementation can be a worthy
    move. As India is home to many reputed IT Company therefore the growth of Blockchain
    Technology is noticeable ([Sun, Yan, & Zhang, 2016](#r26)). Different survey and
    reviews displayed that there are different companies working deeply on this technology
    and specially from the Bangaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Kolkata,
    Delhi. The details of some of the companies are depicted in Table 1.

    there are huge requirement in skilled and well knowledgeable professionals in
    the field of Blockchain and allied technologies ([Sakhipov & Baygozhanova, 2020](#r24)).
    And as a result in many countries Governments are taken initiative on introducing
    academic programs in the field of Blockchain which are emerging, skill based.
    Such academic programs not only training based but also come with full fledged
    degree. According to the study it has revealed that only a few universities offers
    degrees including Bachelors, and Masters in the areas of Blockchain Technology,
    and there are potentialities in introducing more programs in the field like MTech
    by Research, MS by Research, Ph.D. Program, Post Doctoral Training Program and
    so on (Paul et.al., 2017). It is worthy to note that, Blockchain Technology is
    offered not only as Blockchain Technology but also as a merger with other technology
    and some of the available nomenclature are listed herewith—

    Blockchain technology is offered in different institutions and universities with
    B.Sc., and B.Tech. nomenclature and with the subjects such as Computer Science,
    Computer Science and Engineering, Information Technology, and so on. Importantly
    the programs are offered with merged nomenclature such as Cryptography, Distributed

    offers a degree called B.Engg. (Bachelor of Engineering) instead of Bachelor of
    Technology. Furthermore the study shows that most of such degrees available with
    4 Years duration and basic eligibility is 10+2 with Pure Science. However Mangalore
    based Srinivas University offers Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) program to any
    10+2 qualified. Different allied technologies play a vital role in strengthening
    IT Systems and among these important are Cloud Computing, Big Data and Analytics,
    Internet of Things, Crypto currency etc ([Hiran & Henten, 2020](#r8)). Blockchain
    is useful in government and business sectors. Manpower development is important
    in order to produce skilled manpower in the areas of banking and finance, agriculture
    and horticulture, healthcare and medicine, manufacturing and automotive. And there
    are different job titles available in the areas of Blockchain and among these

    and finding primary challenge considered as important challenge in Indian context.
    Misconception about the Blockchain is that it may replace the existing systems
    but real fact is Blockchain Technology helps in integrating existing and new systems
    for higher amount of efficiency. Blockchain is dedicated in digitalizing blocks
    and connected with each and every node and all the records basically received
    by all the nodes, therefore if one or several systems failed in a system then
    entire things remain kept in the mechanism. Thus, Blockchain Technology is transparent
    and also offer greater degree of security. Blockchain is applicable in diverse
    field but in Indian context it is suitable in the areas such as banking, financial
    services as well as insurance industry. As far as land title registry, vehicle
    lifecycle management, institutional and farm insurance is concerned Blockchain
    Technology is worthy and important. According to a report of PwC released on October,
    2021 expected that Blockchain may reach and boost 1.76 trillion GDP globally.

    regard not only private organization but also Government bodies, establishments
    and ministries playing leading role for the improvement of the Blockchain technology
    infrastructure. The study says that, Foreign Direct Investment in India has increased
    in India in the areas of Computing and IT industry was 26.14 billion USD in the
    areas of 2020-2021 though in the year 2019-20 it was just 7.67 billion US Dollar.
    Thus India is to be one of the important technological hubs for the change of
    the society. Here in addition to the Blockchain few more such as Cloud Computing,
    Big Data and Analytics, Internet of Things, Crypto currency may be considered
    as important part for overall and complete development of ICT infrastructure.
