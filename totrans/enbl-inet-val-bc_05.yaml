  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The core principle of the Internet of Value (IoV) is the fast and easy transference
    of value between two parties, cutting out middlemen or eliminating third party
    costs in the process. In the e-commerce world, the transference of value occurs
    when consumers “pay” for the products they are “buying”. Credit card and online
    payment systems such as PayPal are the most common methods for transferring value,
    certainly in a consumer world. However, these systems still rely on a go-between
    to complete the transfer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most e-commerce platforms today still rely on these traditional forms of payment,
    but some e-commerce platforms are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as payment,
    e.g. Shopify. Although much has been written about cryptocurrency, it is not yet
    widely adopted across e-commerce as a medium for payment; however, cryptocurrency
    represents an opportunity to facilitate the quick transference of value.

    that are currently both slow and relatively costly. The role of technologies such
    as blockchain in disintermediating such processes is well recognised and opens
    the door to quicker and more cost-effective processes. There is a wide range of
    digital transactions where Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) can facilitate
    such value exchange, from loyalty points to shares and from music to art.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although value is often expressed in monetary terms (assets, stocks, products,
    etc.) it can also relate to the social or consumer value that customers receive
    when buying products or services. In this case, value is transferred via things
    such as time saved, feel-good customer factor or reducing environmental impact.
    These may be less tangible than the transfer of money, but in today’s world, they
    are no less important.

    two core issues that must be addressed are *trust* and *transparency*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditional e-commerce payment methods have a level of surety; if a customer
    uses a valid credit card, the seller will get paid, and in return, the customer
    trusts that they will get the goods they have paid for. The supporting banking
    system provides a level of support, albeit not infallible. In addition, consumers
    today want validation and greater awareness of a product’s authenticity, manufacture
    and lifecycle.

    models enabled by the IoV, we must examine the impact blockchain has on providing
    sufficient trust and transparency to enable a quick transfer for value, whether
    monetary, social or perceived customer value. Across retail and consumer Goods
    Industries, collectively known as consumer markets, the areas that we see as emerging
    include: loyalty, direct to consumer, servitisation, sustainability and the areas

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Loyalty programmes have been around for a long time in industries such as retail,
    hotels, airlines and credit cards. These programmes are all designed to try to
    build customer loyalty by rewarding the right behaviour. Establishing loyal customers
    has always been important given the frequency of repeat business and average basket
    size; driving repeat business is critical. Most of these programmes have been
    focused on the interests of the company by geography and have been engineered
    to retain the “value” in the rewards to only be consumable within their own business.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some companies have found that running such loyalty programmes can be expensive
    and with questionable returns. In challenging economic times, it is easy to lower
    the level of rewards, but that can lead to a significant drop in engagement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is really needed is a more cost-effective model to run loyalty programmes
    and allow the currency of the reward to be utilised across brands/companies/channels/geographies.
    This is where blockchain can help enable a new generation of loyalty programmes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain is well suited to holding secure information about transactions that
    generate rewards and providing a platform to allow rewards to be spent only once.
    Combined with the management of identity, this can then become a valuable source
    of insight and marketing opportunities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain could be used to simply keep track of virtual points, or to manage
    tokens as the reward currency. By overcoming the complexity of traditional loyalty
    schemes and driving higher engagement and redemption rates while reducing costs
    per transaction, blockchain can be used to establish a new approach to loyalty
    programmes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most consumers are members of many different loyalty programmes (the average
    is over seven schemes per consumer in the US); carrying multiple loyalty cards
    is a nuisance and does little to encourage engagement. Having blockchain-based
    loyalty tokens that are interoperable across loyalty schemes would significantly
    affect this. This approach can also address the problem of points expiring over
    time and enhance the overall customer experience by increasing flexibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smaller organisations are not excluded from such opportunities to engage in
    blockchain-enabled loyalty programmes, as costs are reduced. For businesses running
    such schemes, fewer people would be required to run the system and monitor the
    liabilities. Online sites can use such reward schemes to drive repeat business
    and increase total customer value. Offering such a loyalty scheme for customers
    across multiple companies provides increased exposure through network effects.
    An excellent example of this is qiibee,^([1](#Fn1)) which lets companies create
    loyalty coins on a blockchain.

    need for retailer intermediaries. In reality, however, the lines are blurred between
    manufacturers and retailers, but for simplicity, we focus here on the pure D2C

    is critical to ensure the deliverance of viable D2C models, and blockchain has
    the capability to help redefine how these supply chains work and, in turn, open
    up different ways of selling in a D2C model.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Servitisation is the process of turning a conventional consumer product into
    a product-as-a-service. In the consumer world, there are many examples from meal-kit
    subscriptions to product replenishment, and from clothing subscription services
    to product rental. None of these ideas are new, but with e-commerce, the models
    have been given a new injection of life and, more importantly, the ability to
    do things differently. Blockchain and DLT have the opportunity to enhance these
    models further by focussing on trust and transparency to underpin and quicken
    the transference of value in the IoV.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To illustrate this, take the example of online high fashion rental business
    models. This is fundamentally a B2C model whereby customers can either rent single
    items for a designated period or sign up for a subscription service which gives
    them a certain number of items in a given period. In this case, the value is transferred
    for a limited time until it shifts back to the buyer. Given the relatively low
    barriers to entry, consumers are also increasingly able to connect and rent directly
    with other consumers (C2C), thereby deriving an income from their assets, namely
    their clothes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most cases, these models follow the standard e-commerce approach, namely
    “find products”, “add to basket” and then “pay” via credit card or online payment
    methods such as PayPal before the products are shipped to the customer. Along
    the way, banking intermediaries take fees for processing the transaction, and
    there is an inevitable delay in terms of value being transferred between buyer
    and seller.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although some measures are in place already to prevent fraud, the risk still
    exists that a seller may rent an expensive item for a fraction of the retail cost
    and never see the product again. Of course, the flip side of that argument is
    that customers trust the product they are renting is indeed genuine, either in
    terms of the brand name or how the product is manufactured (e.g. there is no leather
    or fur, or it is made from sustainable cotton, etc.)—in other words, the product

    The term sustainability originates from the French verb “soutenir”: “to hold up
    or support” (Brown et al. [1987](#CR1)). In practical application, this involves
    utilising Earth’s finite resources efficiently and responsibly with consideration
    of resource supply for the following decades.'

    Raw materials are utilised in goods and service production, and then disposed
    of despite still retaining economic value. Switching to a circular economy minimises
    our resource expenditure through optimising production to be most lean and implementing
    processes to utilise materials post-consumption. Circular economy minimises natural
    resource expenditure in the short run to retain a larger total amount of natural
    resources in the long term.

    scholars since the 1970s, alongside the mnemonic of the 3Rs: *Reducing* materials
    and waste; *Reusing* products; and *Recycling* materials (Kirchherr et al. [2017](#CR5)).
    The circular economy has regenerative and restorative design at its core so that

    per capita has drastically increased; with the average lifespan and usage of products
    declining. Consumers have grown more impatient and less resourceful with purchases,
    leading to a large excess of waste and a strain on the planet’s resource abundance.
    This waste will often be burned or left to pile in landfills, causing additional
    negative externalities to the environment. The circular economic growth approach
    mitigates pollution impacts, protects finite resources, and can lead to greater
    employment opportunities and innovation incentives (Ellen MacArthur Foundation

    lead to EUR 8 trillion more in other economic benefits. Additionally, another
    100,000 jobs could be created by 2025\. As the circular economy requires innovations
    to progress past linear value chains, it will incentivise interdisciplinary collaboration

    are transparent and traceable. Blockchain enables the provenance of an item, which
    is beneficial in tackling counterfeits. According to the OECD and EUIPO ([2016](#CR6)),
    counterfeiting is worth nearly 0.5 trillion dollars worldwide. Typically, it involves
    deceptive counterfeiting, where consumers believe they are purchasing an authentic
    item. Alongside the economic loss, many human lives are lost due to counterfeiting
    each year (Hirschler [2017](#CR4)). If provenance is known, customers can make
    better-informed decisions and divert expenditure from the counterfeit market.
    Secondly, provenance shows fair work practices and respect for workers’ rights,
    as buyers can confidently know that an item is supplied and manufactured from
    ethically sound sources. Third, it allows for the discarded waste from goods production
    to be traced. Excess materials such as the USD 100 billion wasted in clothing
    per annum is monitored using blockchain, mobilising the trade of excess materials
    between producers (see also Chapter “The Internet of Value in Consumer Markets”).

    of 1 tonne of clothes generates approximately 23.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide; consumes
    1060 m3 of water; and produces 1.7 tonnes of waste annually (Wrap [2017](#CR8)).
    The problem extends into the industry’s waste issue, as 80% of waste is incinerated
    or landfilled. These practices lead to soil acidification. The widespread use
    of synthetic textiles also releases toxic microplastics into our oceans, harming
    aquatic creatures and makes its way into the human food chain. Fashion’s drastic
    environmental impacts in combination make 8.1% of global climate impacts across
    non-renewable energy use, freshwater use, human health, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions,
    and ecosystem pollution (Quantis [2017](#CR7)). These externalities are projected
    to worsen by 2030, with GHG emissions and waste both expected to increase by around
    68% to 2.8 billion and 147 million tons/year respectively (Global Fashion Agenda
    and The Boston Consulting Group [2017](#CR3)).

    half of us own clothing that no longer fits us; 10% hang on to unworn favourites,
    and 36% of us keep pieces that feel outdated or out of fashion. For example, the
    UK’s water, carbon, and waste footprints could be decreased by 4%, 3%, and 1%
    per tonne of clothing respectively if there was a 10% increase in second-hand
    sales (Wrap [2017](#CR8)). With waste being a growing issue, the circular economy
    solution will likely gain traction, and the need for provenance of the product
    will become more evident.

    they receive a Certificate of Ownership, a non-fungible token (NFT). They are
    then able to enter this into their MonoChain wallet. When completed, the user
    can receive offers to sell the item in real time. When selling to a buyer, the
    item is first moderated. The NFT and money are held in separate wallets, and this
    is enabled using a multsig escrow and Ricardian contract. If the item is authentic,
    the NFT and the product move to the buyer. The seller will then receive their
    payment. Each time the item’s ownership changes, it is recorded in a private blockchain
    (Hyperledger Sawtooth). MonoChain has plans to move to a public blockchain in
    the future to include information on item provenance, materials, and other relevant
    information.
