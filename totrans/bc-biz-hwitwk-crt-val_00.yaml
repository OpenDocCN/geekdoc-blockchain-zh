- en: The motivation behind this book was the desire to impart succinct knowledge
    in the field of blockchain technology—a technology that has been singled out as
    a pillar of the Fourth Industrial Revolution by World Bank. However, it was written
    not only to fulfill the desire of the editors and contributing authors but also
    to address the desire for such a book expressed by all the technical students,
    researchers, academicians, and professionals who we interact with on a daily basis.
    We understood the need for this book after observing numerous sessions and independent
    lectures on the subject of blockchain technology. It was evident that blockchain
    technology is currently one of the most important futuristic technologies, and
    that researchers and professionals all across the world are beginning to show
    tremendous interest in learning about this piece of technology.

- en: The world essentially became aware of blockchain technology way back in 2008
    with its first ever massive-scale implementation in the form of a digital currency
    called Bitcoin, introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper. However, a lesser
    known fact is that the first occurrence of blockchain technology and its associated
    concepts was observed in papers published from 1991 to 1997 titled “How to Time-Stamp
    a Digital Document,” “Improving the Eﬃciency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping,”
    and “Secure Names for Bit-Strings” authored by W. Scott Stornetta *et al.*—also
    known as the founding fathers of blockchain technology—the mention of which can
    be found in the “references” of Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin whitepaper.

    2020, we could sense the sudden influx of further interest in the technology,
    which cemented the idea of this book in our minds. This book has taken the shape
    of a reference as well as a textbook that can help academics, researchers, professionals,
    and experts alike. The approach followed in the book is that of a reference manual,
    starting with certain very important blockchain technology-related topics, including
    an introduction to the technology, a discussion of the ecosystem that people have
    started building around it and other topics (i.e., Ethereum, Wallets, Governance,
    Bitcoin), its challenges, and many more.

    such as the Internet of Things, to discuss the changes rendered in the areas of
    supply chain management, identity management, etc. Blockchain applications are
    focused on in order to provide viable references to the readers and help them
    imagine real-world implementations across other sectors.

    a new dimension to the knowledge imparted. Practical concepts are discussed beyond
    the expected theory, which should help the readers obtain an added advantage as
    they go through the chapters discussed below.
