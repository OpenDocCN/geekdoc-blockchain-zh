- en: The motivation behind this book was the desire to impart succinct knowledge
    in the field of blockchain technology—a technology that has been singled out as
    a pillar of the Fourth Industrial Revolution by World Bank. However, it was written
    not only to fulfill the desire of the editors and contributing authors but also
    to address the desire for such a book expressed by all the technical students,
    researchers, academicians, and professionals who we interact with on a daily basis.
    We understood the need for this book after observing numerous sessions and independent
    lectures on the subject of blockchain technology. It was evident that blockchain
    technology is currently one of the most important futuristic technologies, and
    that researchers and professionals all across the world are beginning to show
    tremendous interest in learning about this piece of technology.

  zh: 编写此书的动机源于在区块链技术领域传授精炼知识的愿望——这项技术已被世界银行确定为第四次工业革命的支柱。然而，我们不仅为了满足编辑和贡献作者的愿望而编写此书，也为了回应我们每天互动的所有技术学生、研究人员、学术人员和专业人士对这类书籍的期望。在观察了无数关于区块链技术的研讨会和独立讲座之后，我们意识到这本书的必要性。很明显，区块链技术是目前最重要的未来技术之一，全球的研究人员和专业人士都开始对学习这项技术表现出极大的兴趣。
- en: The world essentially became aware of blockchain technology way back in 2008
    with its first ever massive-scale implementation in the form of a digital currency
    called Bitcoin, introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper. However, a lesser
    known fact is that the first occurrence of blockchain technology and its associated
    concepts was observed in papers published from 1991 to 1997 titled “How to Time-Stamp
    a Digital Document,” “Improving the Eﬃciency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping,”
    and “Secure Names for Bit-Strings” authored by W. Scott Stornetta *et al.*—also
    known as the founding fathers of blockchain technology—the mention of which can
    be found in the “references” of Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin whitepaper.

  zh: 世界本质上是从2008年开始意识到区块链技术的，当时以一种被称为比特币的数字货币形式进行了第一次大规模实施。然而，鲜为人知的事实是，区块链技术及其相关概念的第一次出现是在1991年至1997年间发表的论文中，这些论文题为“如何为数字文档时间戳”、“提高数字时间戳的效率和可靠性”和“为位串提供安全的名称”，由W.
    Scott Stornetta等人撰写——也被称为区块链技术的创始人——这些论文在中本聪的比特币白皮书“参考文献”中有所提及。
- en: When LinkedIn ranked blockchain technology as the number-one “hard skill” for
    2020, we could sense the sudden influx of further interest in the technology,
    which cemented the idea of this book in our minds. This book has taken the shape
    of a reference as well as a textbook that can help academics, researchers, professionals,
    and experts alike. The approach followed in the book is that of a reference manual,
    starting with certain very important blockchain technology-related topics, including
    an introduction to the technology, a discussion of the ecosystem that people have
    started building around it and other topics (i.e., Ethereum, Wallets, Governance,
    Bitcoin), its challenges, and many more.

  zh: 当LinkedIn将区块链技术列为2020年排名第一的“硬技能”时，我们可以感觉到对这项技术的进一步兴趣突然涌入，这巩固了我们在心中这本书的想法。这本书已经成为一本参考书和教科书，可以帮助学术界、研究人员、专业人士和专家。本书采用的是一种参考手册的方法，从一些非常重要的与区块链技术相关的主题开始，包括介绍技术、讨论围绕该技术建立起来的生态系统以及其他主题（即以太坊、钱包、治理、比特币）、它的挑战以及更多内容。
- en: Furthermore, this book takes a deep dive into the inclusion of additional technologies,
    such as the Internet of Things, to discuss the changes rendered in the areas of
    supply chain management, identity management, etc. Blockchain applications are
    focused on in order to provide viable references to the readers and help them
    imagine real-world implementations across other sectors.
