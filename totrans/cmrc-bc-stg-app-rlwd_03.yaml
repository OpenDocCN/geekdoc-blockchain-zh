    ‘What is Bitcoin? And why are retailers not using it?’ Little did I know that

    worked, using books, online research, and attending meetups. During this research
    I came across Ethereum and started to research Ethereum in depth. (Ethereum is
    a Blockchain on which many different use cases of Blockchain have been built and
    is one of the biggest Blockchain solutions in the market at the moment.)

    History of ASG'

- en: Founded on 23 March 1923, ASG started out as a provisions store in Sidcup, Kent,
    UK. Originally named after the original owner H. H. Chapman (my great-grandfather)
    and selling a wide range of provisions from its double-fronted shop on the high
    street.

    to add to the grocery store estate.
