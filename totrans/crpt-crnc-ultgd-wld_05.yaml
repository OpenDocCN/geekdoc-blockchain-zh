    in choosing an exchange house, they are definitely worth considering. Depending
    on the exchange house you choose, you could find yourself paying a fraction of
    a percentage for each transaction to as much as 5% of your total earnings. However,
    there are also additional fees you need to factor into your choice of exchange
    houses. Many exchange houses will require a monthly service fee for housing your
    digital currency while others may demand an additional deposit or withdrawal fee.
    These are fees that are most likely to get you into trouble when investing in
    cryptocurrency, so the more you familiarize yourself with these, the less likely
    you'll see your profits eaten away by these additional charges before you ever
    get to see any of it.

    financial institutions. So, there is very little you can do if one of them folds
    and your money disappears. It is important that you do your due diligence and
    make sure of everything before you invest your money. Look for exchange houses
    that have a long-standing reputation and evaluate their security protocols before
    making any decisions. If you find a house with very little information about their
    track record, consider it as a warning that they may not have been around for
    very long and have no proof of staying power. It is better to take heed and move
    on.
