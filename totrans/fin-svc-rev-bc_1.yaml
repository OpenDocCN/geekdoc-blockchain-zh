    bankrupt, and the global economy went into a tail-spin. At 22 years old, I had
    stumbled into a trial by fire. When the ashes settled from the financial inferno
    that ultimately engulfed many of the world’s biggest banks, my firm was still
    standing, and I was (somehow) still employed. I was one of the lucky ones. For
    many of my generation, 2008 began a lost decade of structural unemployment, sluggish
    growth, political instability, and a corrosion of trust and confidence in many
    of our institutions. The financial crisis exposed the avarice, malfeasance, and
    plain incompetence that had driven the economy to the brink of collapse and had
    some asking, “How deep did the rot go?”

    A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” introduced a radical new concept: cash
    over the Internet—a way to move and store value without intermediaries like banks
    and governments.⁷ What was remarkable about Bitcoin is that it worked, and it
    set off a spark that has caught on like wildfire and captured the imaginations
    of technologists, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. In January 2009, Satoshi
    said, “I would be surprised if, 10 years from now, we’re not using electronic
    currency in some way. … If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling
    prophecy.”⁸ Today, bitcoin has a value of $200 billion, and the most powerful
    people in the world—from Donald Trump to Mark Carney (Bank of England), Steven
    Mnuchin (US Treasury), Jerome Powell (US Federal Reserve), and Christine Lagarde

    player in the global financial system. It could change how, where, and with whom
    billions of people spend and save, borrow and loan, and otherwise finance and
    insure their lives and livelihoods. If Facebook succeeds—and that’s a big if—then

    Swiss foundation with potentially over 30 members. By putting up this big tent
    for other companies and organizations to participate in governance, Facebook is

    decides to devalue its currency to make exports more competitive or investment
    more attractive, individuals will be able to opt out to a “hard dollar” digital
    alternative. Those living in Venezuela may not fully trust Facebook, but they’ll
    probably trust it more than the tin-pot dictator devaluing their currency. To

    QQ Coin, which users could purchase for one yuan on a nonrefundable basis. QQ
    Coins soon became commonplace for online payments before the Chinese government
    cracked down on them.¹⁴ More than 10 years on, we can imagine private sector actors

    effective medium of exchange for payments where counterparties expect some predictability.

    most consequential computer science invention in a generation. It laid the rails

    interface (API) and allow contributors to start earning real value in Props. Founders
    and investors will no longer be the sole beneficiaries of platform growth. In
    the context of financial services, we can view Props both as a new payment rail
    for organizing contributors in a network and as an incentive mechanism, like equity,
    for staying on the platform and adding value to it. Already, 200,000 people are
    using Props on YouNow with 100,000 Props transactions per day. The plan is to

    stablecoin DAI: MakerDAO is “digital financial infrastructure that aims to create
    unbiased currency and unbiased access to credit for everyone,” according to its
    founder Rune Christensen. More simply, MakerDAO views its mission as a logical
    step from Bitcoin. “Bitcoin was supposed to be better peer-to-peer-cash. Bitcoin
    doesn’t make good cash. It’s an excellent store of value and a check on central
    banks but it is not good cash,” said Greg Di Prisco of MakerDAO. How does Maker
    solve these perceived shortcomings? “Maker is a decentralized central bank. Everyone
    has the ability to generate money against their own assets. Traditionally, you
    need a commercial bank to act as intermediary,” but now anyone who owns ether
    can do so instead.⁵²'

    Crucially, the smart contract is set up so that each DAI must be over-collateralized.
    So, for example, if you pledged $150 equivalent of ether to the MakerDAO smart
    contract you could conceivably create $100 of DAI, but no more. The goal is to
    ensure that DAI doesn’t “break the buck,” that is, maintain its peg to the USD.
    The decision to choose the USD was more practical than philosophical. Right now
    the USD is the global reserve currency and the most widely recognized medium of
    exchange so it was logical to start with that reference point.

    from $20 to over $1,400 before crashing below $100 and now sits at $200—we might
    wonder how something collateralized in such a volatile asset could possibly maintain
    its peg to a comparatively steady one. With DAI, if the value of ether drops below
    a preset threshold, the smart contract will liquidate the ether locked within
    it to ensure that the contract is always properly collateralized and the price
    maintained. An added buffer is a stability fee individuals pay into the system
    when they create a DAI.

    by fire. Launched in 2018, it has withstood the collapse in the price of ether
    while maintaining its peg. The smart contract manages all of the mechanics of
    this process autonomously. Right now, the value of DAI sits at around $90 million
    (and the total value locked in Maker is $300 million) but MakerDAO plans to grow
    aggressively by opening up collateral to any kind of asset, most likely in 2019.

    tool for laundering money or buying illicit goods. Critics argued that, because
    the technology was decentralized, lightning quick, and peer to peer, criminals
    would exploit it. To be sure, criminals are always one step ahead of the law in
    harnessing the latest technology. Marc Goodman, author of Future Crimes, wrote,
    “Exponential times lead to exponential crimes.”⁹⁰ So this criticism of bitcoin

    The US Telecommunications Act of 1996 was a significant overhaul of broadcasting

    as Bitcoin, makes regulating a difficult challenge. Bitcoin should be lightly
    regulated, but large corporations that seek to transform financial markets ought
    to be subject to scrutiny. Indeed, their centralized nature makes it far easier
    to do so. As Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, told us, “Congress wanted a throat
