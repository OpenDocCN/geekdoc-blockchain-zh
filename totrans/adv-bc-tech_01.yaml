    physical technologies to create responsive and interconnected operations. Companies
    use AI, robotics, edge computing, and the cloud to make informed and timely decisions
    from the supply chain to the smart factory [[1](#CR1)]. Solutions designed for
    the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use connected sensors and edge devices
    to help improve product quality and operational efficiency in factories in real
    time. From workshops and worksites to decision-making stations, tools and equipment
    are now networked to become interconnected. Through sensors, detectors, and other
    monitoring devices, machines and operators are collecting increasingly huge amounts
    of data, the management, analysis, and exploitation of which constitute enormous
    challenges for companies [[2](#CR2)]. The Internet of Things brings a wealth of
    promise in productivity, quality, performance, and security [[3](#CR3)].

    It could very quickly prove to be indispensable for the deployment of all connected
    objects, by adding a layer of security via a chain associated with the identity
    of the connected object, making it resistant to hacking attempts [[6](#CR6)].
    This identification chain, characteristic of the Blockchain, allows connected
    objects to receive commands and securely communicate with each other. Indeed,
    the Blockchain will enable objects to interact with each other without communicating
    via a third party, thus limiting the outflow of information or potential attacks

    digital twins. To ensure data security in the case of multiple untrusted parties
    sharing data and improve users’ satisfaction with the use of digital assets in
    daily transactions [[21](#CR21)]. Chapter “[Blockchain-Based Communication for
    Digital Twins](513458_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml)” combines the digital twins technology
    with Blockchain technology, and for multiple scenarios in Blockchain networks,
    a credible and efficient edge computing resource allocation method is proposed
    based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) theory. The log storage system of the
    Blockchain is mainly used as the interface for writing and reading data operation
    logs, and a hybrid storage strategy is put forward for the log storage system.
    As for the trusted resource allocation under the decentralized model of the Blockchain
    network, to prevent the system from directly offloading the computing tasks submitted
    by the user each time to the edge server, first, the task is submitted to the
    system. Then a more reasonable resource allocation strategy is implemented with
    user satisfaction as the standard. The simulation experiment results show that
    the improved environment after introducing the log storage system reduces the
    storage overhead by about 75% compared with the Blockchain benchmark environment.
    When the number of servers is greater than 5, compared with other resource allocation
    algorithms, user satisfaction of the resource allocation algorithm based on DRL
    theory has been significantly improved compared with Q-learning algorithm. Its
    user satisfaction has increased by 15%. In conclusion, the digital twins use credible
    source data as input. In this process, the Blockchain ensures data management
    security, and the data analysis is performed to predict events and evaluate related
    factors. The resource allocation method based on DRL realizes credible resource
    utilization based on recorded data on the Blockchain.
