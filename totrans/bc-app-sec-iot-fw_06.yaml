- en: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Internet of Things
    (IoT) are incredible instances of the technology paradigm and have brought about
    revolutionary changes in the communication, internet, and digital sectors coalesced
    into one and induced a landslide shift in the lifestyle of mankind. But the privacy
    concerns of the individuals can be trustfully and transparently addressed only
    by the use of ingenious contemporary technology, the Blockchain. Blockchain is
    a kind of distributed ledger technology that uses a peer-to-peer, distributed
    network to make a continuous, growing chain of time-stamped records to form a
    digital ledger. It is decentralized, which means that it can not be controlled
    by a central authority. It has numerous advantages like transparency, immutability,
    decentralization and can be incorporated in almost any sector of the society to
    increase the security of the transactions being carried out. This chapter predominantly
    focuses on the concepts of Blockchain and aims to do a comprehensive survey on
    its advantages and applications and also highlights the future prospects because
    even though it is so popular today, this technology is still in its infancy.

    as apt as it can be. Today, Blockchain technology is taking the globe by storm.
    The enormous amount of buzz and hype that this technology has created is attracting
    the attention of a massive number of researchers and scientists and will eventually
    create the dawn of a new revolution. This chapter aims to provide a brief but
    clear understanding of the important aspects of this technology among the readers.

    for attaining the highest levels of comfort. This can practically be achieved
    only with the development and evolution of science and technology, which eventually
    gives us a plethora of immensely useful applications that make life easy for us.
    We are currently living in an era where the world is changing at a rapid pace,
    and there is a constant shift of the common mass towards contemporary technologies.
    These innovations have affected every industry, be it business, healthcare, energy,
    financial markets, and so on, to the extent that in recent times, these technologies
    have reached the comfort of our homes and affected the way we live and socialize
    [[1](#r1)]. In this world powered by technology, everything comes at a cost We
    are living in times where we are experiencing a gradual transition from cash to
    cashless payments. Electronic Cash or E-Cash, the digital form of cash, is allowing
    easy and hassle-free transactions of money over the internet. This invention is
    in and of itself a commendable achievement that has caused a stir in the world
    of trade and commerce, and the immense importance of which can be understood during
    pandemics like Covid-19\. But cybercrooks, with their felonious talents, are ever-ready
    to make some profit by breaching data of the transactions being carried out. Secure
    online transactions that involve third parties also cannot always be trusted.
    Let alone cybercriminals and private third parties, it has often been seen that
    the economic growth and development of most of the developing countries is often
    impeded by corrupt government officials who misuse their authority to satisfy
    their greed for monetary gains. Blockchain technology, which first came into the
    picture with the advent of Bitcoin in 2008 [[2](#r2)], promises decentralized
    and secure transactions over the internet and is a successful attempt to solve
    these problems.

    technologies available today to add to their benefits and make them safe and secure
    for use. It is a Distributed Ledger Technology that records and maintains transactions
    chronologically, occurring on a peer-to-peer scale where every peer essentially
    maintains a copy of the transactions being carried out. An important point to
    be noted is that ‘no third party is involved’ and validation of new blocks to
    be added to the chain occurs only if at least 51% of the participants vote in
    favor, otherwise it is rejected. Now you must be wondering, what are blocks? They
    can simply be understood as pages of a record book that constantly register the
    latest transaction being carried out. Once a block runs out of memory (think of
    it as a page being filled with records), a new block is needed to be generated
    for which voting is done for its final validation and generation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The need for this technology arose with the International Banking Crisis which
    led to the collapse of investment in 2008\. Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which was
    the first practical example of this technology, brings along with it many advantages
    such as efficiency, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and a privacy-preserving
    secure system for creating and recording financial transactions. With an ever-increasing
    human population and urbanization, the number of transactions being carried out
    is increasing exponentially and is speculated to affect the complexity, efficiency,
    and cost of the current systems and in turn, increase its vulnerability [[3](#r3)].
    The current digital transactions rely on trusted third parties to fulfill their
    objectives. Whether these parties can be trusted or not is a big question. Though
    these third parties which can be anyone- a Government Agency or a private owner-
    claim that the transactions are carried out in a secure environment, is it so?
    Studies have shown that even though a few central authorities follow strict protocols
    to preserve the privacy and security of transactions to the extent that they provide
    certificates of assurance, these technologies are not foolproof. For example,
    SSL certificates that ensure us that we are on a secure website have also been
    stolen from few very well-known domains of Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, and Central
    Intelligence Agency (CIA), UK.

    need a technology that is efficient, fast, and at the same time affordable. Blockchain
    is the perfect solution to this. People don’t need to pay money to any third party,
    like a bank or a private organization, to maintain their records as digital ledgers
    which can be monitored with ease and precision owing to the peer-to-peer, distributed,
    and decentralized nature of the Blockchain architecture. The world needs a technology
    like Blockchain which provides a safe and secure platform for carrying out the
    transactions, complete ownership and authority over one’s property, and also transparent
    transactions to be carried out. The data once stored on the network cannot be
    changed or deleted because of its immutability. This is an immensely important
    feature that can be used to store extremely important and private data on the
    system. This technology also addresses another very important issue- the problem
    of Double-Spending. Since the records are maintained strictly chronologically,
    one can easily keep a track of the money spent and avoid the problem and loss
    caused by double-spending [[4](#r4)]. Having understood its need, let us now learn
    about this technology in detail.

- en: 'This topic first came into existence on 31^(st) October 2008, when Satoshi
    Nakamoto’s white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was released
    [[2](#r2)]. The paper discussed a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”, which
    allowed online payments to be sent directly from one party to the other without
    involving a bank or any other financial institution. This discussion is incomplete
    without mentioning Bitcoins. Bitcoin is the first practical example of Blockchain
    technology, that came into existence in 2009 and is the first-ever cryptocurrency
    to be developed and is the most popular example of this technology. It is an innovative
    method of payment that has introduced virtual cash and is one of its kind. Considering
    its design, it only allows the exchange and distribution of digital information
    and bars its modification. You must remember that Blockchain and Bitcoin are not
    the same things. Blockchain is the technology used for the creation of the digital
    currency, Bitcoin. Let us understand this with the help of an example. A mobile
    phone is just a small metallic object without an Operating System (OS). OS adds
    life to the phone and is simply software that manages the tasks and its worth
    can only be understood by the applications it can host. Considering this example,
    a Blockchain is analogous to the Operating System and Bitcoins to the applications
    it holds.'

    that there will be an exchange of assets either in the present or in the future.
    It is the fundamental unit of Blockchain and represents exchange by transfer of
    values from one participant to another [[5](#r5)]. A transaction includes the
    recipient, signature identifying the sender, amount of cryptocurrency being used
    for the transaction to be brought into action, gas price (cost paid by the sender
    per computational step), and the gas limit (maximum number of steps a transaction
    is supposed to be executed in). In technical terms, the transaction can be defined
    as the product of gas price and the amount of gas used.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The term node refers to the user or participant who is a part of the Blockchain
    platform. They form the building blocks of the Blockchain Infrastructure. When
    an attempt to add a new block to the chain is made, it is reflected on all the
    nodes in the system, and depending upon how authentic a transaction is, the nodes
    can together accept or reject the proposal. Nodes can either be online or offline.
    Online nodes are active participants in the network while offline modes need to
    catch up with the latest advances by downloading the new blocks that were added
    when they were in offline conditions. The process of updating the offline blocks
    is known as synchronization.

    blockchain, and it is this process that facilitates the safe exchange of assets
    in the network. Miners are the nodes that are capable of mining. They have to
    solve a cryptographic puzzle for the creation of valid blocks and the miner who
    solves the puzzle first gets to add a block to the networked chain. They broadcast
    their block on the network which then requires verification from all the nodes
    in the network irrespective of whether they are simple nodes or miners. If the
    block is voted to be valid following the consensus mechanisms (which is explained
    in Section 4.7 of this Chapter), the block is added to the chain, otherwise, it
    is rejected.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hashing is the process by which input of simple integers and strings is converted
    into a complicated, non-decipherable encrypted output using complex mathematical
    algorithms. Hashes of any length of input always give a fixed length of output
    and this makes it practically impossible to guess the original word. It is a ‘one-way
    function’ and can not be cracked. So how does it help in checking the authenticity
    of a message? Let’s understand this with the help of an example. Suppose you want
    to download some important official document that is highly confidential. For
    this purpose, you will need a hash of the document and the digital signature of
    the sender which in turn is also hashed. The document message is encrypted and
    made it impossible to decipher using hashing algorithms. They act as a trap-door
    function that prevents it from being traced. The receiver decrypts the message
    using the same hashing function and signature and compares the two hash values.
    If the same hash value is produced, it can be said that the document and signature
    are both authentic. There are many algorithms available for this purpose, like
    different versions of the Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) – SHA1, SHA 224, SHA256,
    SHA512, *etc*., Message Digest Algorithm (MD) – MD2, MD4, MD5, Keccak – Keccak-256,
    Keccak 512, *etc*., Shake(Secure Hash Algorithm and KECCAK) with versions 128
    and 256\. Shake is different in the sense that it produces any length of the output.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The data to be transacted has to be secured using digital signatures which ensure
    that the data is not meddled with. The purpose of using digital signatures is
    to bind the signatory to the message which is to be sent. For this purpose, the
    participants use cryptography techniques which may either be public-key cryptography
    or private key cryptography. Digital signatures are the digital counterpart of
    handwritten signatures and should ideally be non-forgeable by any attacker. Let
    us gain an understanding of how digital signatures work. To sign a document, the
    sender uses two mutually authenticating keys, that is, the sender’s private key
    and the receiver’s public key. The mathematical algorithm used acts like a cipher,
    by encrypting the data and creating a hash of the message. Only the correct receiver
    can decode the document by using his private key and the sender’s public key.
    If in any case the document changes after signing, the digital signature becomes
    invalid. There are several digital signature algorithms available.

    storage used to produce blocks and the fastest one in computing the solution stands
    a better chance of creating blocks. The process which this algorithm follows is

    refers to a piece of code that is stored on the Blockchain network and executed
    automatically when certain conditions are met. Colloquially, they are self-executing
    scripts encoding set protocols in Blockchain that digitally verify and implement
    the contract made between participants and ultimately help in transferring digital
    assets [[10](#r10)]. Smart contracts were first introduced by Ethereum and are
    written using the Solidity programming language. There are many tools available
    for authoring Smart Contracts, but the web-based tool Remix is the handiest among
    all.

    one of the test Networks available to get some Dummy Ethers in our wallet because
    the deployment of a smart contract cannot be done for free. (Ether is the cryptocurrency
    of Ethereum). For this, we need to select one of the test networks available as
    shown in Fig. (**[4](#f4)**) (I have used the Goerli Test Network because it is
    comparatively easier to get test Ethers on this network, but you can choose any)
    and open the Testnet Faucet browser of that network. By providing our account

    is not possible. It adds to its security because transaction records since Day

    to be some other person. He can just not make any transaction because firstly,
    it needs to be validated by all, and secondly and most importantly, the private

    vote in favor of a decision, for example, creation of a block, it is created,
    otherwise, the proposal is discarded. Each user actively participates in the transaction
    verification process. The users may or might not be rewarded for their involvement.
    To understand this clearly, imagine that you are a part of a public Blockchain

    are created only when the old one runs out of memory. In a public Blockchain,
    when a request for new data to be added to the blockchain is received, the request
    is reflected on all the nodes in the network. If the transaction is approved following
    the consensus rules, it is validated by adding a timestamp and added to the blockchain
    network by linking it to the previous block. This decision as to which nodes will
    append the block is very critical because cybercriminals might be ready and lucky
    enough to cause the 51% attack. For this reason, the mechanism of the consensus
    algorithm being used also becomes extremely important. A transaction is made secure

    10 min. Also, a Bitcoin network has a limitation of 7 transactions/second, which
    is not capable of dealing with high-frequency trade. Also, larger blocks require
    more storage space and a slower rate of propagation [[22](#r22)]. This has the
    possibility of causing a shift to centralized networks that can maintain such

    add to the modernization of human lives. Having developed a fundamental idea about
    what Blockchain is and also its applications, advantages, challenges, and future
