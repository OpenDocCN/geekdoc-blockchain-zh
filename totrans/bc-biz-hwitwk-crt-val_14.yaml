    connected to one another using cryptography holding up a hash value with contains
    all the necessary details, like the timestamp and the information about the transaction
    itself. It sure needs a data structure to design up that organization of data,
    so the data structure which is used to store the data is a tree, and Merkle tree
    to be specific. Also, it’s easy to connect all the blocks to one another using
    a tree ([Figure 14.1](#figure1)).

    of information the government recruits various people to handle these records
    that include birth and death dates or information about marital status, business
    licensing, property transfers, or criminal activity. Manage and use this information
    can be complicated for the government. Some records exist in the paper form and
    someone who wants to change the information in oﬃcial paper, for this citizen
    has to appear in the front of a government regulator. Because the regulator has
    to protect the data against unauthorized user. A blockchain-based digital government
    can protect data from hacker and also it helps to reduce fraud simultaneously
    it helps to increase trust and accountability with the help of blockchain technology,
    government, individual, businesses share resources over a distributed ledger using

    any kind of the services provided by the government. This system also helps in
    increasing trust in the people for the government by make them participating in
    their process, by giving them the authority to see, verify and check the data.
    Decentralized can also called as kind of distributed network everywhere or distributed
    ledger technology which means every participant in the blockchain is having its
    own copy of the data, this make the government process transparent and also helps
    in increasing trust in the people. And there is a one more property of blockchain
    is that it is immutable means the data cannot be changed. For example while registering
    our land it should be very beneficial and can be helpful in reducing or solving
    many land disputes. These features transparency, immutability, etc. of blockchain
    helps in minimizing frauds and corruptions in many government services. As we
    all heard of much news of many scams in the government organizations.

    that it uses cryptographic hash functions, data encryption and its distributed
    ledger technology. As this data belongs to the government and public so, this
    makes their data very secure and increase accountability. Blockchain also good
    for the removal of black market or black money in to the government as there is
    no middle man in between you and the service, you doesn’t have to pay extra money
    to the middle man in between for the service that is already yours. Say for example
    you are taking loan from a bank and all your papers are clear, you can get the
    loan easily, but the middle man came into the picture and ask you a cut from that
    loan. But in some cases both the parties are involved in this kind of practice

    and foremost is the tendency of the decentralization, no one system or entity
    can control the whole network. The second is the stability, no past record or
    the transaction details added to the node can be changed or altered afterwards.
    The third is the security of the data; the data is highly secured by encoding
