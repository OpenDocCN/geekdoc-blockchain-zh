    a central authority having control. It is an empowering innovation for people
    and organizations to work together with trust and straightforwardness. A standout
    among the other known better uses of blockchains is cryptographic monetary forms,
    for example, Bitcoin and others; however numerous different applications are conceivable.
    In this chapter, we will be discussing about the specific qualities every particular

    connected to one another using cryptography holding up a hash value with contains
    all the necessary details, like the timestamp and the information about the transaction
    itself. It sure needs a data structure to design up that organization of data,
    so the data structure which is used to store the data is a tree, and Merkle tree
    to be specific. Also, it’s easy to connect all the blocks to one another using
    a tree ([Figure 14.1](#figure1)).

    about individuals, organization, asset and many more. To manage different types
    of information the government recruits various people to handle these records
    that include birth and death dates or information about marital status, business
    licensing, property transfers, or criminal activity. Manage and use this information
    can be complicated for the government. Some records exist in the paper form and
    someone who wants to change the information in oﬃcial paper, for this citizen
    has to appear in the front of a government regulator. Because the regulator has
    to protect the data against unauthorized user. A blockchain-based digital government
    can protect data from hacker and also it helps to reduce fraud simultaneously
    it helps to increase trust and accountability with the help of blockchain technology,
    government, individual, businesses share resources over a distributed ledger using
    cryptography. A blockchain-based government has the potential to solve legacy
    issues. Blockchain technology extends way beyond Bitcoin.

    It’s a mathematical algorithm that transforms a bit of information into a string

    If there’s even the slightest trade in the input facts, the output hash can be
    extensively one-of-a-kind (this is called the avalanche impact). Avoiding any
    correlation among hashes, it’s a “one way characteristic” because the usage of

- en: A Smart Contract is likewise a contract but rather digital and Smart, and by
    Smart it means it consists of set of rules and protocols which aids the identification,
    verification and imposes the negotiation to hike the conduct of the contract.
    Smart Contracts made a reasonable transaction to be made without even the incorporation
    of a third party.

  zh: 智能合约与传统合约相似，但它是数字化的、智能化的。所谓的智能化是指它包含了一组规则和协议，有助于识别、验证并强制执行合同的谈判和执行。智能合约使得交易可以在不涉及第三方的情况下顺利完成。
- en: The Blockchain Technology is glorious for its network to be distributed, so
    it is easy for all the parties to access it and therefore ends the wish of a mediator.
    It is also helpful in plenty other ways like it saves a lot of time and it is
    highly secure. Another great aspect of smart contracts is that it reduces the
    rivalry or the conflict between the parties as everything is now out in the open
    among all the parties.

    is of some value in a very fast, eﬃcient and a transparent way. Also, there is

    time, flourishing Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and LiteCoin have drawn quite
    attention to this technology. Now most people want to invest and develop the technology
    of Cryptocurrency. Also it is now more likely to develop your own cryptocurrency
    due to the open source nature of these two cryptocurrencies. Due to the availability
    of previous written source code, for just a small fee, you can actually be able
    to build your own cryptocurrency. But these services might not provide you some
    functionality or key features of the cryptocurrency already in use. So these codes
    will not provide you the key insights to the main functions but the source code
    is easily available.
