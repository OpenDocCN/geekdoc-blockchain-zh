    technology. Starting from the popular digital terms in the current market, the
    authors examine the current environment of the development, including Chinese
    government policies and the industry situation, and then compare the different
    characteristics of Industry 4.0 before and after digitization by combining the
    two digital technologies (i.e., blockchain and internet of things [IoT]). Moreover,
    the advantages of the integration of internet of things and blockchain in supply
    chain management will be highlighted. At the same time, according to the changes
    brought by digitization, the added value of IoT and blockchain integration will
    be analyzed from the perspective of different stakeholders. In addition, some
    Chinese case studies will be introduced to show the innovative performance of
    and benefits for enterprises, to provide references for enterprises, and to implement
    IoT for smart economic growth.

    in order to cope with the complex financial environment. This led to changes in
    finance technology innovation and advancement in the technology; thus, created
    a fast-paced, technology-led finance environment. As a trading power, e-commerce
    has become a major factor in China which cannot be neglected. The earliest history
    of e-commerce in the world began in 1970s, when electronic trading was conducted
    mailing financial institution. As a result, the electronic data interchange (EDI)
    expanded the forms of transaction. In the 1990s, the World Wide Web (the “Web”)
    allowed the companies to send and receive texts and photos, and the term E-commerce
    was introduced. Afterward, the E-commerce has reformed from B2C to B2B, as in
    the Chinese case of Alibaba, and then to B2E, and will continue to develop in
    the future (Turban et al., 2018). With the economic development and the improvement
    of people’s living standards, technology expanded China’s commerce from the traditional
    offline to online commerce and expanded the national as well as the international
    market. In 2015, payment services, online loans, data analytics and automated
    investment have developed into the fastest-growing areas for big data in finance
    (Monaco, 2019).

    National Bureau of Statistics show a clear tendency. 2013, national e-procurement
    amounted only to 34662.9 billion Yuan. However, 6 years later that number more
    than tripled to 101275.1 billion Yuan, (National Bureau of Statistics, 2020).
    In Figure.1, the x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis represents e-procurement
    quantities in different years and the different colors on each column represent
    enterprises from different industries. All of the numbers are recorded in units
    of 10 billion yuan to show the yearly changes in the industry shares. As an important
    part of supply chain management (Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply
    (CIPS), no date), the amount of e-procurement in different industries is gradually
    increasing in recent years.

- en: With the advent and development of Industry 4.0, improved communication provides
    more choice to the customers and increased risks and uncertainties, an issue that
    modern enterprises need to consider (Scholten & Fynes, 2017). The strategic and
    technical choice of supply chain management is particularly important when an
    enterprise is faced with many suppliers and different projects, which are related
    to whether the enterprise can realize the potential benefits of the project and
    then reap the profit (Wei et al., 2021). In order to solve similar problems, the
    application of digital technology in supply chain management has become the focus
    of many enterprises. A survey on blockchain in China published by Weilian and
    Puhuayongdao shows that respondents think that logistics is the most valuable
    field for this application, accounting for 63.3% of the statistics of application
    ranked first. Meanwhile, 20% of the enterprises are using blockchain for supply
    chain management, and the majority of respondents are optimistic about the use
    of the technology (Weilian & Puhuayongdao, 2018). This shows that the application
    of digital technologies such as blockchain in supply chain management in China
    has a good mass base and the support of enterprises. In fact, with the policy
    support of Chinese leaders and the drive of leading figures from various industries,
    many enterprises have applied digital technologies such as internet of things
    (IoT) and blockchain in supply chain management and benefitted by combining them.

    digital technology in supply chain management, but there are few practical implementation
    cases in China (Zorzini M. et al. 2012). This chapter will give a more detailed
    analysis of the benefits of IoT and blockchain integration in the supply chain
    management from the perspective of China, and contribute to the discussion by
    exemplifying some recent cases in China. This chapter aims to investigate how
    institutional change would drive the development & promotion of blockchain-based
    technology integrating with supply chain business settings by analyzing the police
    changes set by the Chinese government. Several case studies have been used to
    demonstrate how the business sector responds to this institutional change. By
    understanding the logics of institutional change, this chapter will enable readers
    to interpret the future roadmap of integrating IoT and Blockchain for smart and
    secured supply chain management in China.

    have been shifting their operations and services into digital ones, and they have
    achieved results such as improved efficiency, enterprise performance and agility
    (Balci, 2021). The most important digital technologies used in digitalization
    include cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT and blockchain. This
    chapter mainly focuses on IoT and blockchain.

    connected at any time (Wang et al., 2015). It collects data from the environment
    through sensors and devices (Karale, 2021). Compared with traditional network
    systems, IoT can operate in a secure and stable manner without human interference
    for a long time (Gulati et al., 2021). The features of IoT can be used across
    global supply chain management, facilitating the flow of information in real time
    and the tracking of business processes across different platforms (Wang et al.,
    2015). At present, the IoT is still an emerging and underdeveloped technology,
    and its privacy and security issues are still under research, but many industries
    can apply it to innovate and bring about better enterprise forms, while eliminating
    some of the manual operations and processing (Babun et al., 2021).

    transactions on the basis of a distributed peer-to-peer network (Dietrich et al.,
    2021). It is an emerging technology characterized by transparency, automation
    and trust, providing the necessary infrastructure for financial systems, and is
    currently in the mass deployment phase (Wang et al., 2021b). By digitizing transactions,
    the readability and accessibility will be improved, so as to improve the coordination
    and security of information exchange (Černý et al., 2021). This distributed technology
    avoids intermediary transactions, potentially increasing product and service benefits
    and reducing capital costs. At the same time, this greatly helps small and medium
    enterprises to innovate by giving companies clear access to patents. As supply
    chains are a long-term dynamic structure, they need to constantly meet the changing
    needs of customers, so this is a general direction of blockchain application (Javaid
    et al., 2021).

    much more than logistics (Cooper et al., 1997). According to the Council of Supply
    Chain Management Professionals, supply chain management is “the planning and management
    of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics
    management activities. However, due to complex changes in the environment, this
    definition is constantly updated (Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals
    (CSCMP), 2013). Nowadays, it is the concept of a number of sections in the form
    of a network of agents to achieve a common goal, which consists of material venders,
    suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers (Terrada et al.,
    2020). If the supply chain has a concept of sustainability, resource efficiency,
    social responsibility and financial performance need to be taken into account
    to maintain competitiveness (Dai et al., 2021).

    competitiveness. Innovation now also means commercializing a new idea in the marketplace
    (Shaikh et al., 2020). In order to improve the competitiveness of a country or
    industry in the era of Big data, it is necessary to accumulate knowledge and resources
    in different markets and fields to promote innovation (Xie et al., 2021). In the
    past two decades, the financial industry has seen continuous innovation with improving
    resource allocation rates and new innovative opportunities for many other industries.
    However, the social requirements for innovation are becoming more pronounced,
    requiring enterprises to innovate not only in terms of resources and efficiency,
    but also in terms of environmental protection (Yuan et al., 2021). This is a major
    reason why digital technology is booming.

- en: In fact, with the development of science and technology, there are more and
    more smart device users in China. Smart devices are physical devices with microphones
    and virtual assistants, such as smartphones and smart speakers (Frick et al.,
    2021).They are being massively integrated into daily life on the basis of IoT
    (Nespoli et al., 2021). It is very common and popular to have multiple smart devices
    such as tablet, smartphone, laptop, even smart TV for work or communication (Zhang
    et al., 2013). These devices not only bring convenience to users, but also facilitate
    the digital transformation of industry 4.0, which is a new era of information
    and communications technology (ICT) where information about real products is linked
    to web-based applications and integrated into the production process (Ali et al.,
    2021). The concept was first proposed by the German government in 2011 as a critical
    strategy for industrial production (Bonilla et al., 2018). Because of the integration
    of information and communication technology and the end-to-end engineering across
    the entire product life cycle as its basic concept and important innovation, it
    is expected to meet new challenges and enhance the competitiveness of industries
    in Germany via the digital interconnection (Birkel & Müller, 2021), and push toward
    full digitalization as required by Industry 5.0.

    are constantly influencing the financial industry. Facing the pressure of shortening
    time and changing customer groups in the digital era, some enterprises begin to
    innovate and promote the digitalization of their organizations (Zhou et al., 2021).
    As digitalization is important, especially for developing countries; digital inequalities
    arise if a nation cannot keep up with pace of digitalization (Jamil, 2021). There
    are already many non-tech industries, such as agriculture, transportation. These
    non-technical industries and our society will enjoy the benefits of digitalization
    in different forms in the future including enterprise efficiency and agility.

    supply chain (Ni & Sun, 2019). The integration of financial and business information
    requires increased communication and trust (Huang et al., 2020), and this is why
    the integration of IoT and blockchain is gaining a lot of attention.

- en: This chapter interprets the logics of integrating IoT and blockchain for smart
    and secured supply chain management in China via examining the changes of institutional
    settings. Institutional settings affect the direction of economic development.
    As pinpointed by Yu et al. (2018), “Institutions can be defined by commonly known
    rules used to structure recurrent interaction situations that are endowed with
    a sanctioning mechanism. Institutional theory looks at the deeper aspects of social
    structures with a high level of resilience (Scott, 2008). North (1990) defined
    institutions as ‘the humanly devised constraints that shape interaction’ and distinguished
    formal institutions created by entities such as the government and public services
    from informal institutions such as social convention or customs and implicit constraints.
    Economic activities are conducted under a certain institutional setting that define
    the interest of each member in the marketplace and how they can be achieved and
    protected.” By comparing and analyzing the interlinked relationship between the
    application and the implications of blockchain-based IoTs in supply chain system,
    this section helps readers to better capture the changing dynamics of the rapid
    development of blockchain IoTs in the sector (Yu et al. 2021).

    have the most impact. In other words, once the national policy is issued, there
    will be a large number of companies to seize the opportunity to respond (Weilian

    seeing the development trend of digitalization, the thirteenth Five-Year Plan
    suggested that the economy should be guided to the direction of smart change (Xinhua,
    2015). The government proposed accelerating the construction of smart economy
    in all aspects, streamlining administration and delegating power, encouraging
    traditional enterprises to transform into smart economy, and focusing on the integration
    of technology brands and channel resources related to smart economy (Ya, 2016).
    In 2017, eight cities in Shenyang signed a strategic cooperation agreement on
    the construction of Shenyang Economic city group, and it is expected that the
    cloud computing, big data and other basic platforms in each city will be built
    and shared by 2020 (Ying, 2017). In 2018, the Chinese government has released
    news from Economic Daily, hoping to lead the people in developing digital economy
    and smart life (Han, 2018). Then in 2019, the second session of the 13th National
    People’s Congress put forward to expand “smart” and build industrial Internet
    platform (Hu, 2019). The year 2020 was the culmination of promoting the smart
    economy. In September 2021, Zhejiang province launched the 2020 World Digital
    Economy Conference showing the full convenience and infinite potential of the
    smart economy (Ying, 2020). China Development Research Foundation and Baidu also
    jointly issued New Infrastructure, New Opportunities: The White Paper on The Development
    of China’s Smart Economy on December 15, 2020\. This white paper analyzed the
    current patterns and trends in China and made suggestions for the next step (Foundation
    & Baidu, 2020). Zhejiang province has launched a digital platform economy monitoring
    system to prevent illegal activities and monitor risks in the smart economy (Xinhua,
    2021b). These measures have created a good atmosphere to China’s digital economy
    market and provided further guidance for industrial development.'

    adjusts and formulates policies in a timely manner to promote the development
    of the national economy. Under the leadership of the government, the digital economy
    of China has grown rapidly from 22 trillion yuan in 2016 (Xinhua, 2017) to 35.8

    meet customer needs by adding value from raw materials to the final product (Javaid
    et al., 2021). Getting the right sections at the right time requires transparent
    and efficient data transmission. With shared information, cooperation between
    suppliers and customers can improve the competitiveness of the supply chain. Cooperation
    enables enterprises to reduce costs, share risks, meet customer needs and use
    various resources (Müller et al., 2020). Therefore, a number of digital technologies
    are also evolving in the middle and late part of this period, with IoT having
    remarkable impact in business and blockchain (Mehta & Senn-Kalb, 2021). IoT is
    all about connecting items for real-time data transmission, improving the efficiency
    of the supply chain (Rejeb et al., 2020). At the same time, blockchain is used
    to protect data transmission and prevent data from being tampered with and eventually,
    to improve the sense of trust between different industries. In addition, there
    are AI, cloud computing, big data and other digital technologies to promote the
    digitalization of the industry 4.0 (Aheleroff et al., 2020).

    of IoT, many businesses are combining it with blockchain, which is characterized
    by transparency and decentralization (Saxena et al., 2021). The integration of
    blockchain and IoT can not only reduce the cost of developing and maintaining
    centralized data centers, but can also help to eliminate security issues such

    regulators need to rebuild the regulatory framework. The current regulators believe
    that companies should be classified according to their risk level and size, which
    also requires close co-operation to understand the market, balance risk and potential
    value, while preventing regulatory arbitrage. Blockchain is assumed to replace
    settlement methods of the 19th century (Arner et al., 2016). So, the question
    is; how to understand the market? To regulators, all actions performed by IoT
    devices are recorded (Šarac et al., 2021). They can clearly check the actions
    when there is something wrong. IoT is used to handle the huge data record, and
    blockchain is used to ensure the security and authenticity of the data. The integration
    of these two can help regulators to monitor the situation.

    the company’s operation, which also requires a lot of data analysis support. While
    IoT can help collect data, its centralized nature can lead to single points of
    failure and targeted cyber-attacks. At the same time, the ubiquity of IoT connectivity
    makes the attack range more extensive. Decision making and crisis prevention is
    thus more difficult for management. At such times, the combination of decentralized
    and interoperable blockchain and IoT is a good solution. The immutability of blockchain
    strengthens the trust of cooperation between enterprises, and its high elasticity
    can effectively prevent information attacks (Bandara et al., 2021). Management
    can utilize blockchains for security policy prosecution and maintaining an openly
    inspectable ledger of IoT interactions, excluding the third-party security dependence
    (Saxena et al., 2021). The security is ensured while the efficiency is improved.

    IoT devices with blockchain have built trust and allow devices to retain current
    data flow while improving security and privacy (Šarac et al., 2021). They can
    securely and quickly track transactions and verify the condition so that the parties
    to the transaction are seamlessly connected, ensuring the visibility of the process

    was anti-counterfeiting tracing, which was 50%, followed by distributed storage
    and authentication. In addition, data sharing and applications as well as supply
    chain management were also above 20% (Figure 4). The data shows that enterprises
    are paying attention to the application of data storage and security issues according
    to the characteristics of blockchain, and supply chain management. It is a major
    application direction of this technology due to the complex process and the need
    for information security. Figure 5 shows the ways of applying blockchain in these
    companies. More than half of the enterprises interviewed installed their own blockchain
    teams, and a third of them cooperated with specialized blockchain companies, but
    few were willing to cooperate with the blockchain departments of other enterprises.
    Both data were collected by PwC, VeChain Foundation through face-to-face interviews
    and online surveys in relevant businesses. Since blockchain itself is employed
    to solve the security and trust problem, their own research and development and
    specialized blockchain companies were to protect their own information security.

- en: The “TBC blockchain Cross-border Trade Through Train” platform is designed for
    parallel import, customized in four varieties of value service, such as the trade
    enterprise, logistics enterprise, financial machine and the pipe body. The platform
    establishes the data standard of on-chain trade, allows the information of on-chain
    trade to be cross-compared and verified, and confirms the right of goods on the
    chain (Weiguan Tech, 2019). The digital asset system of enterprises is established,
    and the trustworthy traceability system of the whole permissible process of cross-competitive
    trade is created.

    it is difficult to determine the relationship of mutual trust. Characteristics
    of blockchain are highly consistent with the pain points of cross-border trade.
    Through the cross-comparison of data information of participating roles, it forms
    a reliable data storage chain, breaks the information island in cross-border trade,
    and thus solves the dilemma in the traditional process (Chen, 2019).

  id: totrans-167

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The economic environment of the supply chain is complex and changeable, and
    the smart economy requires the efficiency and security of all parties on the chain
    to be improved, which needs real-time, accurate and true information. The added
    value of the integration of IoT and blockchain can well meet the condition. IoT
    can collect data, but the accessibility, transparency and traceability of the
    system raises concerns about data privacy and security (Kayikci et al., 2021),
    and these deficiencies can be resolved with blockchain features. The management
    and decision-making layer of companies can quickly collect a wide range of data
    and make reasonable decisions through calculation. Investors can make better comparisons
    to reduce losses and crises. Regulators can also monitor abnormal phenomena in
    the industrial chain in an all-round and real-time way to carry out control. Technology
    is a necessary condition for the realization of the smart economy, and the above
    supply chain practices cannot be successfully implemented if there are technological
    constraints in terms of capacity and resources. At the same time, the strengthening
    of links between upstream and downstream enterprises meets the collaborative sharing
    of future smart economy and creates good conditions for sustainable development.
  id: totrans-168

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, the sustainability of smart economy mainly reflects the ecological
    and industrial environment. Due to the timely circulation of information, effective
    design and decision-making of enterprises can greatly reduce the wasting of resources
    and improve waste recycling. Regulators will also be able to monitor emissions
    of production pollution, which is beneficial for the green economy now. In addition,
    enterprises strengthen communication and contact, and break down barriers, thereby
    promoting healthy competition between enterprises, and constantly promoting industrial
    innovation.

    on the public, smart and secured supply chain management. The government needs
    to first set an example, and the supervision departments are to be arranged properly.
    Secondly, some large enterprises need to play a leading role in the supply chain
    management. Social relations are extremely important in the supply chain, which
    affects the sustainability concerns of upstream and downstream enterprises, thus
    driving the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises. Most importantly,
    some small and medium-sized enterprises, temporarily lagging behind, need to change
    the concept of supply chain management in order to keep up with the pace of smart
    economy, and need to be willing to innovate and transform. The ability of these
    three parties to make changes in the industry plays a significant role in the
    stability of the supply chain in society as a whole.

    economy in China, sorted out the innovation and development of supply chain management
    under industry 4.0, and showed the rules and regulations of Chinese government
    for shaping smart economy. The chapter focused on the digital changes brought
    by the integration of Internet of Things and blockchain after industry 4.0, and
    summarized the value addition of the integration from several perspectives. In
    addition, the authors also collected Chinese cases of supply chain in terms of
    platform connecting various enterprises and cross-border trade for reference and

    of digital economy policy, some specific data are difficult to collect. At the
    same time, after summarizing the benefits of IoT and blockchain integration in
    the supply chain management, the actual business case for IoT is not detailed
    enough compared to blockchain. Future studies can continue to collect the data
    to fill in the gaps.
