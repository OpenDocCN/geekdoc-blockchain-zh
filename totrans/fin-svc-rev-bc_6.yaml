    Accounting rules give managers leeway to reallocate funds and revenues inside

    the record of ownership. At present, centralized ledgers keep most such records,
    and only highly trusted parties can access and modify these records. Cash is kept
    in bank accounts, and a bank account is a central registry. The record of ownership
    of a house is kept in a property registry. Securities such as stocks, too, are
    kept in central securities depositories such as the DTCC in the United States
    or the Canadian Depository for Securities (CDS).³⁵⁷ Finally, records of most bilateral
    contracts are commonly kept by the parties involved, and transactions that the
    terms of the contract trigger thus involve a complicated account-reconciliation
    process. Consumer loan agreements are usually additionally registered with the

    ledgers, and its setup defines who can make changes to the ledger and under what
    circumstances. At its core, a block-chain is an append-only protocol that stores
    “transactions,” where in principle a transaction can be a trade but also text-based
    information such as a piece of programming code. The key feature of a blockchain
    is that, by recording transactions, it ensures a consensus on the current owner
    of an asset. Anyone can explore token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain using
    the public website Etherscan.io, which pulls data from the Ethereum blockchain;
    or the Bitcoin blockchain using the website Blockchain.info.

    the keepers need to update their backups continuously to avoid data loss and thus
    need a backup protocol to ensure that data in the backup is accurate.'

    “[a] system … that [is] operated by multiple parties, none of whom fully trust

    one downloads a so-called wallet software; an example is the “Mist wallet.” These
    wallets monitor the Ethereum blockchain to find transactions that have been sent
    to the wallet. As part of the process, one downloads the information from the
    Ethereum blockchain and becomes a node.'

- en: A private distributed ledger, in contrast, is built by either an individual
    firm or by a consortium of firms and differs from public distributed ledgers in
    several key ways. First, a private network can be permissioned and can thus restrict
    who can use it to record transactions and can view the flow of information and
    assets across it. For financial institutions, this feature is important as it
    allows them to comply with KYC legislation, which is a usually a prerequisite
    for compliance with AML rules. Moreover, in principle, these networks don’t need
    a trustless protocol. A downside is that a consortium solution raises the specter
    of collusion and rent extraction typical of a trust; for instance, network members
    may restrict entry, fix prices, and collude on fees. From a competition policy
    perspective, it may thus be desirable to mandate a trustless protocol to remove
    a barrier for new entrants wishing to join a consortium network.

    argued, for instance, that transparent ownership attribution in a blockchain can
    help address the so-called empty voting phenomenon, where an entity gets to vote
    on economically meaningful decisions without having an economic stake in the firm.³⁸⁰
    The usual assumption is that economic interest in a firm and voting rights are
    coupled with the ownership of a share. However, derivatives contracts make it
    possible that a party obtains a large number of voting rights without having an
    economic stake in the firm.³⁸¹ With ownership attribution via a blockchain, it
    would be transparent at any point in time who owns a stock and who has an economically
    justified right to vote.

    and in academia, are a further obvious use case. Insiders are already required
    to announce their trades and holdings, but there are often significant delays
    between the transactions and their reporting.³⁸² Therefore, if all trades were
    recorded on a block-chain, then—by revealing their public IDs—insiders could credibly
    and immediately show their trades. All their trades would be visible, which would
    eliminate costly reporting requirements and could increase public trust.³⁸³ The
    public would be in the position to understand insider holdings and insider trading
    better, and firm executives would create trust with their shareholders. This argument
    applies particularly in jurisdictions where insider trading violations are less
    strictly enforced than in North America. Finally, transparency of insider trades
    should reduce the propensity of insiders to engage in illicit trading. As transparency
    reduces the flexibility of insider traders, it becomes more profitable for outsiders
    to generate information about firms.

    contracts, such as swaps, were forced to be cleared with a newly developed central
    counterparty (CP). The basic idea is that when A wants to sell to B, then A sells
    to the CP, and the CP sells to B. Why is this necessary? Imagine that A has also
    bought from C, but that C goes bust. A would then not be able to deliver to B

    a large investment in a recently issued firm whose securities are blockchain-based
    tokens. The mutual fund would convert fiat currency, such as the Canadian dollar,
    into a block-chain-based currency such as ether. This transfer would occur at
    a blockchain-based exchange. The exchange would know who bought the ether (because
    they have to follow KYC regulations). After the transfer is made, the fund would
    use the newly purchased ether and buy the crypto security. As I outline in the
    appendix, usually this transfer is performed in an exchange wallet that combines
    the actions of numerous market participants. For final settlement, the fund would
    then transfer the securities to a non-exchange wallet. But the fund does not have
    to use a known wallet or reveal the wallet ID to the public. Instead, the fund
    can create a dedicated new wallet. Or the fund can create an arbitrary number
    of new wallets and split the holding among these. If done carefully, it would
    be impossible for an outsider to piece together this big purchase. This solution
    can also be formally programmed using so-called hierarchical deterministic (HD)
    wallets, which algorithmically generate a new public key for every piece of a
    larger trade.
  prefs: []

    ledgers. Suppose that a private network is run by a consortium of large banks
    and brokers. Each of them would create one (or many) HD wallets, and record individual
    customers’ holdings within their own systems. This arrangement is similar to the
    current settlement of stock trades. Namely, currently, the settlement of stock
    traders occurs at a central depository, such as the US DTCC or CDS in Canada,
    and the settlement is at the broker level. The main difference is that HD wallet
    settlement is on a distributed ledger, and not in a central database. With the
    distributed ledger there is no informational advantage over the central depository
    solution, even for someone with access to the ledger (in particular not for Canada
    where trades usually carry a broker attribution).

    contract redistributes the amounts to the new addresses.³⁸⁷ From the outside,
    we could not further follow a trail of money. Needless to say, in a public block-chain

    are at least three ways:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1.We become miners, meaning that we use our computer to participate in the verification
    activities of the Ethereum blockchain. If we succeed in creating blocks of transactions
    then we obtain newly minted ether as a built-in reward. However, successful mining
    requires specialized computing equipment—a standard central processing unit is
    much too slow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2.A third party sends ether to our address, for instance, in return for a real-world
    item of value (say, a baby stroller that we sell on Craigslist).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3.We convert fiat currency (e.g., Canadian dollar, US dollar) into ether and
    send it to this address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On that last point, as of this writing, converting fiat currency into digital
    money is a multistep process. First, we need to create an account at a cryptocurrency
    exchange such as Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex, or QuadrigaCX. These exchanges perform
    KYC, meaning that we need to verify our identity by providing a credit card number
    and a scan of our passport or driver’s license. Once the exchange has verified
    our identity, the exchange creates an account, which we can fund by sending money
    to the exchange in our name using, say, a credit card or a wire transfer. Needless
    to say, this process involves non-negligible fees. Once funded, we can then buy
    ether or other digital assets at these cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase, for
    instance, instantaneously converts fiat currency into ether. However, the conversion
    transaction has not settled on the blockchain yet—the money is still technically
    at the exchange. So if the exchange gets hacked or goes bankrupt, our money is
    lost. To be a true owner of ether, we need to transfer funds away from the exchange
    and send them to an address such as the one listed above.
