    Punjab, IndiaIn last decade, we have seen the emergence of various computer technologies,
    each of which was disrupting and revolutionary. Some of these technologies paved
    the way for a newer generation of technologies to make our lives easier. Some
    of these technologies are in the category of invention, as they change and disrupt
    the entire ecosystem. There was a big wave that produced a lot of new billionaires
    and millionaires. What was available for just 2 cents in 2009 is now available
    for more than $15,000 US. Yes, we are talking about Bitcoin and Blockchain. Blockchain
    is the technology behind Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency and especially Bitcoin have certainly
    divided the world into two zones—one that supports cryptocurrency and the other
    that opposes it. The use of cryptocurrency has been such a craze that there are
    around 1400+ cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the market, having more than 17+
    million accounts. People have raised doubts about the future of Bitcoin. A few
    countries don’t allow cryptocurrencies in their economies, but almost all of them
    have provided tremendous support for Blockchain. Bitcoin is just one of the finest
    implementations of Blockchain, but Blockchain is certainly going to stay and is
    currently transforming the way we trust across work and business.Until this point,
    we have assumed the role of intermediaries to be important. They are part of our
    core ecosystem of daily life. Everything that we do, such as buying vegetables
    or buying a house, getting an insurance claim, signing a contract, or even booking
    a hotel destination for our upcoming vacation, includes intermediaries. Apart
    from bringing a few advantages, it also brings several disadvantages, like cost,
    lack of transparency, and brokerage percentages. Wouldn’t it be great if we had
    a technology that reduced all intermediaries? Wouldn’t it benefit the producer
    and the consumer? Yes, this technology has arrived and it’s called Blockchain.
    Bitcoin and the rise of cryptocurrency is possible with the technology behind
    it, which we call Blockchain. Blockchain and Bitcoin are so interrelated that
    a lot of times people use these terms interchangeably. Well before we go further
    and drill down more in detail, let’s understand how Blockchain is not Bitcoin.In

- en: Since the evolution of mankind, there has been various types of exchanges, each
    of which has pros and cons. Back in 6,000 BC, it all started with the barter system.
    The barter system is about trading services and goods. It was definitely a good
    system—a person was required to produce or offer services that he is specialists
    in and then exchange those for the goods that he/she requires. The barter system
    continued successfully for centuries but had a few fundamental flaws including
    the absence of a common unit of value for exchange. This results in creating a
    different valuation for the different exchange of good. For example, buying a
    few apples in exchange of a liter of milk might be good, but the same liter of
    milk might not be traded for rice. It requires a new valuation, which may or may
    not be accepted by all parties involved. Apart from this, few of the goods were
    perishable in nature and few goods were large and heavy, making them transport-unfriendly.
    Another flaw with the barter system was proof of ownership. There was no way to
    tie goods to a person. These flaws led to the emergence of the gold coins era.

- en: The era of gold coins started around 650 BC. The use of coins resolved some
    of the basic and fundamental problems with the barter system. For example, gold
    coins serve as a common unit of value. Now a certain number of goods could be
    exchanged with a gold coin. Gold is also non-perishable in nature and can be easily
    transportable. Gold coins also have a couple of flaws, primarily that they are
    expensive and insecure. Anyone can easily steal gold coins. Moreover, it was not
    easy to mine gold. All of these issues led to paper-based currency, aka FIAT currency.

- en: The paper currency era started around 960 AD. During the initial days of paper
    currency, people deposited gold coins to third-party financial corporations. Some
    of these financial parties are now called banks. In lieu of gold coins, these
    third party gave IOU notes, which were treated as standard currency notes. These
    IOU notes were also termed the first form of FIAT currency.TipFIAT currency is
    the standard currency being supported by government regulations and institution.
    Currencies like the Dollar, Yen, Rupee, Euro, Pound, etc., are current FIAT currencies.
    We use FIAT currency terminology later in the due course of the chapter.People
    who have these IOU notes can exchange them for goods. There are many advantages
    to using paper currency. It is lighter than gold and easy to mine. It was initially
    backed by a tangible commodity like gold, and later by an intangible commodity
    like banks and governments that issue these notes. All the government institutions
    that back various currencies have a standard acceptance of exchange rates. FIAT
    currency has been used across the world in one form or another, as shown in Figure
    [7-1](#Fig1).![A458845_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-1Some of the currently used FIAT currenciesIn spite of paper currency being
    successful and used currently as well, it has its flaws. FAIT currency is unsecured,
    inflationary, and untraceable. There is no way you can tie paper currency to a
    person. Anyone can steal your currency and use it again. Government institutions
    backing currency have no way of knowing who owns the currency. Once the currency  is
    in the market, there is absolutely no way to trace it. This can create a lot of
    inflation in the market, leading to economic issues like black money hoarding
    and parallel economies. Some of the countries also use demonetization drives to
    replace the running currency with new currency notes to stop creating parallel
    economy.

- en: With the rise of all these issues, government institutions brought another exchange
    medium in the market, i.e. checks. The first checks were created in 1717 AD. Checks
    resolve some of the issues with currency and have quite a lot of similarity with
    existing cryptocurrency. First and foremost, they resolved the security issue.
    Checks contain the sender’s and receiver’s identities. Checks also used a very
    elementary form of cryptography (i.e., the signature) to validate the actual sender,
    as shown in Figure [7-2](#Fig2). Each check can have a different value than any
    others, which means two checks can have different amounts. Checks were successful
    in resolving some of the vital issues with previous medium exchanges.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-2A sample check from a checkbook  , where the user is filling in the receiver’s
    infoHowever, checks also have a few issues, especially transaction verification
    time. Consider a normal case, when a buyer needs a good and he issues a check
    in lieu of getting those goods. The buyer gets the good but the seller now has
    to verify the authenticity of the check only when the seller’s bank talks with
    the buyer bank and gets the clearance of debt. Currently, check clearance takes
    from 1-4 working days. There are chances that the check is fraudulent and in practical
    scenarios, the seller now needs to chase the buyer. Checks  also have a very basic
    version of cryptography, via the signature, but that can easily be forged.

    a new medium of exchange, based on which e-wallet was introduced. E-wallet is
    almost a perfect medium of exchange. There is no need for paper currencies and
    you don’t need to carry a wallet with you. It is fast, convenient, and efficient,
    with transaction verification happening in a couple of seconds. This solves the
    biggest issues with checks. It can easily be installed and accessed from any device,
    including mobile devices. By using various mobile biometric and IRIS security
    measures, the validating transaction can reach the highest level of security compared
    to using signatures on checks. As there is no paper currency involved, it’s easy
    for a regulatory authority to track the transaction and track the money usage
    and its supply. It thereby reduces illegal money uses and black money hoarding.

- en: At a high level, e-wallet looks to be very promising, without any flaws, and
    addresses all the concerns with the medium exchange. The biggest problem with
    e-wallet is that it is still tied up with an existing financial structure. Now
    if you remember the financial crisis back in 2008, you will know that financial
    systems can have a good degree of corruption. The financial crisis of 2008 was
    considered the largest recession since 1929\. The subprime mortgage crisis spurred
    financial markets to crash.The worldwide financial crisis in 2008 had a lot of
    consequences. Financial companies collapsed and some governments verged on bankruptcy.
    Large investment banks were bankrupt and the government started bailing out banks
    that they deemed too big to fail. Banks, of course, were most largely impacted,
    because ultimately that is where the crisis originated. These financial crises
    caused people to lose faith in existing financial systems. People used to feel
    that the bank was the safest option to keep their hard earn money, safe and secure.People
    started making mass withdrawals from banks. They had two options at that time.
    Either to keep all their money at home, which is not a great idea, or keep it
    in a bank, which they no longer trusted. There was a need for an alternate financial
    system. In addition, if you look over the current financial transaction, some
    of these take a couple of days to get transferred over the wire if two parties
    are in different countries. Another problem is the unfavorable exchange rates
    that lack transparency and thereby trust.

    of the words marked in bold in this definition is very important. We are going

    a digital currency so it doesn’t have a physical form. Unlike other digital cash,
    it has its own value and has corresponding denomination value for other currencies.There
    is a lot of discussion about Bitcoin being trustless and anonymous. This is not
    correct. In fact, trust is the main issue that led to the emergence of cryptocurrencies
    like Bitcoin. What Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have done is ensure that
    trust is moved from centralized to decentralized systems. Even Bitcoin is a FIAT
    currency  in nature, which means it is not backed by tangible value, but rather
    intangible value, i.e., trust. It has value just because a member of the group
    believes it has value and Bitcoin should be used to exchange in lieu of a good
    just like any currency. The only difference is a normal currency’s trust comes
    from government backing. Out here, it is from the people.Bitcoin, being decentralized,
    is very secure in nature. The Bitcoin system can’t be faked. The system can be
    trusted with full transparency. In fact, identities in Bitcoin are hidden and
    each identity is referenced through alphanumeric codes done using hash cryptography
    rather than names.The Blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin.
    Bitcoin is just an application created using Blockchain. Before delving more into
    Blockchain, it is important to understand the difference between centralized,
    decentralized, and distributed systems.

- en: Centralized systems, as shown in Figure [7-5](#Fig5), are the systems that have
    single point of authority (POA). All the control is concentrated in this authority,
    which ensures all processes and decisions are carried out at this location. Centralized
    systems have a couple of advantages. As there is just one point of authority,
    the decision can be faster and easier to implement. Each point in the authority
    is responsible for one task. This prevents any single task from being done by
    multiple points, ensuring no duplicity and faster change management. Some of the
    examples of the centralized system include banks, Department of Motor Vehicles,
    credit agencies, title companies, and server CPUs, to name a few.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png](A458845_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png)Figure
    7-5A pictorial representation of a centralized system  , where one node governs
    the other nodesThe centralized system  introduces a lot of advantages and hence
    it’s been popular even now. However, centralized systems also have a lot of flaws.
    A single POA brings the notion of having a single point of failure. This means
    if this point goes down for any reason, the entire system will collapse. We witnessed
    such failure during the financial crisis of 2008\. Another flaw with these systems
    is that centralized system lacks transparency and is prone to fraud and distrust.
    Centralized systems works like a black box and people using centralized systems
    might get influenced with fraud and loss of trust. A centralized system has a
    lot advantages and are more suited for systems that can accept a single point
    of trust, require fast growth, and of course, don’t require growing systems at
    scale.

    containing lots of nodes, with few nodes having additional tasks to authority
    and instead broadcasting that authority to several other nodes.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig6_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig6_HTML.jpg)Figure

    the disadvantages of the decentralized system is that, since there is multiple
    points of authority, chances of a duplicate task is higher, which can affect economies
    of scale. A decentralized system is more secure than a centralized one, but is
    still not 100% secure.

    doesn’t mean the system can’t be hacked or faked, but to do it, you must have
    more than 50 percent control over the points of authority. The time needed to
    fake and hack would nullify any benefits and hence distributed systems are considered
    most secure systems. See Figure [7-7](#Fig7).![A458845_1_En_7_Fig7_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig7_HTML.jpg)Figure

    equal. There are a lot of advantages to having distributed systems. Since all
    the nodes are equal, it removes the need for an intermediary. Changes are replicated
    across all nodes and verified by at least 50 percent of the nodes, making it very
    transparent. Distributed systems make perfect options for a system requiring third-party
    trust, intermediary, or even trusting another node. While using the distributed
    system, you don’t need to trust anyone but the system itself. Some of the examples
    of distributed systems include cryptocurrency and of course, Blockchain.With decentralization
    and disintermediation at the core of the Bitcoin system and Blockchain, there
    is no requirement for people to trust each other, just the system. Distributed
    systems  , however, take some time to set up and require a good initial amount
    of investment. Among all the three systems, distributed systems are the most stable.
    Another benefit of using distributed systems is that they are infinitely scalable
    and hence any process involving scalability issues at large scale can safely vouch
    for using distributed systems.

    of BlockchainTo understand the power of Blockchain, let’s look at it from another
    angle. Trust is inevitable and part of our daily life. Everything that we do involves
    some sense of trust associated with it. Whether you are buying a car or house,
    doing any financial transactions, viewing a website, buying products online or
    from the market, or even getting a degree from a university, the ledger in one
    form or another is the fundamental source of trust. Take the case of financial
    transactions. Hundreds of trillions of transactions happen every year across the
    globe. Historically, we maintain ledgers, shown in Figure [7-9](#Fig9), to handle
    and store information about the transaction.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig9_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig9_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-9A classic ledgerThese ledgers have been either kept in lockers for safety or
    have been given to the third parties such as banks, universities, or another third-party
    trusted source. In the last few decades, we saw some of these ledgers moved to
    the centralized database. One of the benefits of using these ledgers is that they
    are easily accessible whenever required. For example, if you want to get a copy
    of a transaction statement that’s 10 years old, it’s just a matter of clicking
    your banking site. Similarly, you can always get a copy of your degree from a
    university in case you lost it, because universities safely store your records.
    This benefit of making it available also makes it vulnerable to errors, making
    it fake, or even modifying it with ease. We have already discussed issues related
    to centralized systems.

    as an original is a great challenge, as anyone who has ownership has the opportunity
    to modify any of the cells and then claim that it’s the original.The rationale

    to record everything of value. This statement provides the true testimony to the
    usage of the Blockchain. Most of the use of Blockchain until now has been associated
    with financial transactions, but eventually, Blockchain can be used to record
    and manage anything that has value.Blockchain technology delivers unbelievable
    traceability that is autonomous and trusted by creating permanent records of data
    and transactions. It thereby brings the single source of truth and no single point
    of failure to all stakeholders, as everything related to data and transactions
    are always visible on the network.

- en: A block is a unit containing a set of confirmed transactions. If Blockchain
    is a ledger, think of a block as a page or book. Each block, as shown in Figure
    [7-13](#Fig13), is composed of the header, which contains information like the
    previous block hash reference, the timestamp on which block is generated, and
    so on, along with the body. The body of the block contains a list of the accepted
    transaction. The header is hashed cryptographically to generate a new block.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig13_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig13_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-13The items available in a block of a BlockchainEvery transaction is encrypted
    (hashed) with a public-private key and every header is hashed to generate a new
    block. Due to this implementation, every transaction has a record associated with
    the new block. The header also contains the address of the previous block, thus
    the chain becomes incorruptible. As more and more transactions happen, the Blockchain
    transaction appends only and creates a chronologically growing timestamp database
    of transactional data, as shown in Figure [7-14](#Fig14). It thereby creates a
    chain block, hence the name Blockchain.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig14_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig14_HTML.jpg)Figure

- en: Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts. They are also known as digital
    contracts. Smart Contracts are not a new concept. In fact, two decades back, Nick
    Szabo, a computer scientist, proposed and emphasized the need for the Smart Contract
    while designing and implementing the decentralized based system.The Smart Contract
    can be treated as a computer program that helps in executing contracts digitally.
    Unlike any other contract, Smart Contracts don’t just define instructions and
    consequences around an agreement, but also enforce them. With the use of Smart
    Contracts, computers can take an action if some requirements get fulfilled. In
    raw terms, Smart Contracts are a suite of various if-else statements. Take a betting
    scenario case. If Real Madrid wins the La Liga, Nishith gets the money; otherwise,
    he pays.In most cases, you might not trust the other party during the betting.
    In these scenarios, self-executing contracts bring a lot of trust on the table.
    Smart Contracts also bring options to revise, execute, or even propose contracts,
    thereby ensuring the highest level of traceability and trust. Take a use case
    of insurance claims. Currently, all insurance companies use the manual process
    of paperwork, complex execution, administration costs, etc. It would indeed be
    beneficial to execute these claims using Smart Contracts to ensure a hassle-free
    claiming process, less administration cost, and the highest level of transparency.
    Take another case of payment where you pay to the contractors only when they fulfills
    your requirement. Smart Contracts  and Blockchain can be used to remove a lot
    of inefficiencies that exist in the contracts management process.

    through Bitcoin. One of the bloggers named Vitalik Buterin found few limitations
    of Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn’t allow you to create your own smart contract or even
    your own currency. Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how important and impactful
    the smart contract can be. Vitalik reached out to the Bitcoin team with a few
    recommendations, such as the ability of Bitcoin to build its own currency or smart
    contract without requiring the need to build the entire Blockchain. Moreover,
    Vitalik insisted on the need for a scripting language on top of the Bitcoin system
    so it can be used for application development and more broader uses. Since Bitcoin
    implementation of Blockchain is more public and based on the shared distributed
    ledger, it was not possible for the Bitcoin team to implement this suggestion
    and they refused. Vitalik wrote a whitepaper explaining Ethereum and got a lot
    of funding, through which he built Ethereum, as shown in Figure [7-15](#Fig15).![A458845_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.jpg)Figure

    to build smart contracts and cryptocurrencies without having people to build their
    own Blockchain. On top of that, it has its own Turing complete programming language
    that allows developers to create custom applications. Ethereum is a game changer
    in Blockchain implementation, as it allows everyone to adopt the Blockchain technology.

    acceptance of the transaction. Such types of Blockchain implementation are less
