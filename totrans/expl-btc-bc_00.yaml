- en: The book takes the reader step by step and layer by layer deeper into the technological
    side of Bitcoin so that someone with no prior knowledge of Bitcoin or someone
    with intermediate knowledge both gets benefited. The book gives greater weightage
    towards explanation of concepts and fundamentals than programing. Though programing
    Bitcoin is important part of this book, more than half of the chapters do not
    contain any programs and are focused on explanation. The book uses Python programs,
    simple language, examples, charts and illustrations to explain each section and
    chapters.

- en: The book is written for people with average programming skill and has interest
    towards understand basics of Bitcoin. Basic knowledge of Python programming is
    necessary. The book uses simple procedural programming which may be understood
    by anyone with average programming even if he has only little prior experience
    of Python.

    is often attributed for financial losses. The book does not provide any financial
    advice and does not aim to influence reader’s financial decisions. It is purely
    a technical book and is only targeted to readers who has interest in the technical
    aspect of Bitcoin. Having said that the book does build a case in favor of Bitcoin
    as a technological milestone and its importance in our future.

- en: The book is an effort to grow Bitcoin developer community by making the knowledge
    of Bitcoin internals easily accessible to the masses. This is the reason why the
    book focuses on theory and uses simple procedural programs written in Python.
    The programs in this book are only created for learning purposes, they are not
    gone through elaborate testing and so are not ready for production environments
    where real bitcoins are used for payments.

    and seed phrases should not be used anywhere in wallet or for sending and receiving
    real bitcoins as they will get stolen.

    concepts explained in this book and can adopt new concepts such as taproot and
    develop their own viewpoint about Bitcoin enhancements and features or start contributing
    to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

    and will understand Bitcoin consensus network. The Bitcoin network topology will
    include types of nodes, their interactions. The Bitcoin consensus network will
    include its components, their interactions and a high-level view of how payments
    in bitcoin can be seen as transaction creation, transaction signing, propagations,
    and finally inclusion into blockchain.'
