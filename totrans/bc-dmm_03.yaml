    day. When you understand the three core types of blockchains and their limitations,
    you’ll know what’s possible with this new technology.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s a lot of buzz surrounding blockchains and the cryptocurrencies that
    run them. Some of this buzz just stems from the fluctuation in the value of cryptocurrencies
    and the fear that blockchain technology will disrupt many industry and government
    functions. A lot of money has poured into research and development because stakeholders
    don’t want to be made obsolete and entrepreneurs want to explore new business
    models.

    to an organization, often the question arises, “Where do blockchains add value
    and how are they different from existing technologies?”

    would use a normal database — but it may not make sense to go through the trouble
    and expense of using a blockchain when a normal database can do the job.

    information with parties you don’t fully truest, your data needs to be audited,
    or your data is at risk of being compromised internally or externally. None of
    these questions are simple, and the correct solutions can be difficult to ascertain.

    — the trick is finding it! Mapping your needs to the best blockchain can be overwhelming.
    Whenever I have lots of options and often conflicting needs, I like to utilize
    a weighted decision matrix.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A weighted decision matrix is an excellent tool for evaluating the needs of
    a project and then mapping those needs to possible solutions. The key advantage
    of the matrix is to help you quantify and prioritize individual needs for your
    project and simplify decision making. Weighted decision matrixes also prevent
    you from becoming overwhelmed by individual criteria. If done properly, this tool
    allows you to converge on single idea that is compatible with all your goals.

    goal or purpose. Take the time to understand where you and your team would like
    to go and what the final objective is. For example, a goal might be to trade an
