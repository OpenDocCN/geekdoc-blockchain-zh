    economy that year proved a boon for storytellers, and not just in cryptocurrency
    books. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the 2011 movie Margin Call, but it’s worth
    your time. I would especially recommend it if you’re interested in the financial
    industry’s (dys)function, and how profoundly it influences every aspect of our
    daily lives. The movie basically limns the situation immediately prior to the
    financial crisis. A risk-management analyst has caught a mistake and suddenly
    understands the hit that his industry is about to take—and what the impact may
    be for the rest of the world. The film is revealing because it lays bare the philosophy
    and attitude underpinning the whole of Wall Street, namely, that risk is usually
    not identified and acknowledged during times when the system seems to be working
    fine and everybody is making money. But as greed grows, things always spiral out
    of control. The financial industry manages trillions of dollars worth of assets.
    The whole world, in some fashion or another, relies on Wall Street to function
    correctly. When it doesn’t, trust is shaken and everybody is impacted.

- en: A new, New York-based company called Vocean is leading the way when it comes
    to connecting fixed-income financial instruments to blockchain. A recent white
    paper issued by the firm lays out the approach that Vocean intends to take, and
    the benefits to consumers. Essentially, Vocean seeks to create a decentralized
    lending platform and loan derivatives market that will allow for dynamic collateral
    management and disintermediated clearing. Using state-of-the-art blockchain technology,
    Vocean aims to provide assistance to investors managing digital assets, cryptoinvestments,
    and related financial products in the realm of the “token economy.”

    traditional financial services products with blockchain, we need to take a look
    at the role that debt plays in the financial industry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many kinds of debt and debt-related financial instruments. They can
    come in the form of redeemable notes issued by a government, bonds issued by companies,
    mortgages, personal loans, student loans, and more. (Just use Wikipedia if you
    want to learn more about the basics of debt and financial instruments.) A debt
    generally also includes specific, contractual terms regarding the amount and timing
    of repayments (for example, your minimum credit card payment), and things like
    principal and interest. Almost all financial products used today find their roots
    in debt.

- en: Vocean would like to use blockchain to increase the efficiency of the entire
    financial industry as it relates to the issuing of debt. The CEO of Vocean, Jerry
    Zhong, is not new to using technology to address financial problems. Zhong was
    one of the “early birds” back in early 1990s who jumped into the Internet with
    both feet. He sees the current upcoming wave of blockchain as very similar to
    the early stages of Internet adoption and sees where we are now as comparable
    to the period when people were trying to figure out how to push the Internet into
    broader use. There’s no doubt that the Internet succeeded in connecting physical
    services (financial or otherwise) into online processes. This created efficiencies
    for everyone. According to visionaries like Zhong, the coming adoption of blockchain
    is going to migrate everything we do online onto blockchain, allowing us to achieve
    decentralization and realize new efficiency improvements. We stand at a juncture
    in which professionals in traditional industries are realizing this. They are
    preparing for the coming changes blockchain will bring, and they’re getting creative
    with it whenever possible.

    However, Vocean believes it will be able to introduce blockchain-based efficiencies
    that will address all three.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, traditional banking services suffer from “low efficiency” management
    of their funds and records. The sheer amount of transactions they must record
    are huge. All too frequently, banking information is stored in different computer
    terminals, or on slow computer networks. Because of the information delays this
    creates, traders at investment banks are less able to make quick and fully informed
    decisions on behalf of their investors.

- en: Second, financial service firms still need third parties to complete the clearinghouse
    function. A clearinghouse is a financial institution that facilitates the exchange
    of payments, securities, or derivatives. Essentially, it functions as a middleman
    connecting two firms. It also ensures that both firms honor their agreements and
    fulfill their obligations. You could view a clearinghouse as a kind of early-stage
    PayPal. PayPal provides not only a platform on which transactions can take place,
    but it also facilitates the transaction between the buyer and the seller. PayPal
    usually charges a 3 percent fee for its services, much like a clearinghouse. After
    the buyer submits a payment, PayPal will hold it temporarily and release it when
    the buyer confirms the receipt of the merchandise. In the traditional financial
    marketplace, clearinghouses are necessary to reduce costs and mitigate operational
    risk.

- en: The third problem Vocean can address is the need for security in cryptocurrency
    by means of a “custodian.” Exchange desks and wallet services have not proven
    foolproof. Hacking incidents do happen from time to time. The resulting security
    and safety issues are a barrier for many large institutional investors. As long
    as they entertain the specter of “losing money because of a hack,” they will be
    reluctant to do business related to blockchain or cryptocurrency. Yet the traditional
    financial industry has developed effective custodians for investors to help them
    store and manage their fiat money and traditional assets. JPMorgan Chase, State
    Street Bank, and Mellon Finance, for example, have been keeping in their custody
    billions of assets on behalf of other institutions for years. As crypto assets
    have increased, the need for similar custodian services has become clear. In May
    of 2018, Coinbase—an American Bitcoin exchange and wallet service platform—began
    providing its own version of custodian service. Adam White, the VP of Coinbase,
    says he is anticipating billions of institutional investment dollars in this connection.
    And according to the May 2018 issue of Cointelegraph, Nomura Bank, a Japanese
    financial institution, announced that it would begin providing a “crypto custody
    solution” for institutional investors. Nomura’s venture will be conducted in partnership
    with digital asset security company Ledger and with the investment house Global
    Advisors. And according to a recent piece in the New York Times, ICE, the parent
    company of the NYSE, has been developing an online trading platform for Bitcoin
    SWAP.

- en: When it comes to these three sticking points, Vocean believes it can provide
    solutions via blockchain technologies. How are Vocean’s solutions going to be
    different from what’s being offered by traditional banking services? Foremost,
    Jerry Zhong believes that blockchain will greatly increase the efficiency of investing
    and all related financial services. A big part of this will be the use of smart
    contracts. Since the smart contract is irreversible, terms can (and will) be executed
    without human intervention. Things will be automatic. Further, all the data are
    stored on the public chain, which will be accessible to all parties involved in
    a transaction and which will considerably lower costs (especially when compared
    to the traditional price point of managing collateral posted to banks).

- en: Vocean is moving forward by building upon the public chain made possible by
    Ethereum. Zhong has explained that his ultimate purpose is to maximize outcomes
    by minimizing the costs and time inputs associated with financial transactions.
    Vocean believes the infrastructure of Ethereum has been proved solid. The customers
    targeted by Vocean are financial institutions who put safety and privacy as the
    two issues at the top of their lists. Are there any trade-offs or challenges?
    The big one is speed. Currently, Ethereum can process fifteen transactions per
    second. That might sound like a lot, but Visa can put up about 45,000 transactions
    per second. Even so, Vocean believes this hurdle in manageable, and that speed
    will improve over time. Vocean is also constructing two smart contract systems.
    One smart contract system will manage the “borrow-lend” function, which connects
    borrowers, lenders, and mortgage management entities. Through the system, these
    three parties can execute semisimultaneous trades. The other smart contract system
    will serve the function of the clearing-houses we discussed above. Due to the
    complexity of the market, price is in a constant state of fluctuation and adjustment.
    Vocean is developing a specific smart contract to manage collateral in this environment.
    When a huge (up or down) price change triggers a margin call, the system will
    protect the value of assets and serve the best interests of credit holders.

    financial situations, borrowers and lenders make exchanges across different currencies
    all the time. Bitcoin and Ether, however, are traded in separate public chains,
    and sadly, Ethereum does not support cross-chain crypto transactions. Vocean is
    planning to build an application to enable this service.

- en: As I think you can see, Ethereum has become the fundamental infrastructure in
    much of the blockchain and cryptocurrency world. Despite its prevalence, it still
    isn’t perfect. Blockchain can be seen as a data storage facility that offers a
    high level of security, but at the cost of low speed. It is not suitable for complicated
    logic functions, or for repeatable trades of low value. Vocean aims to balance
    its reliance on Ethereum with other in-chain and off-chain services. In so doing,
    it hopes to be able to provide the best of both worlds.

    looking inside to see if it’s worth it to come in. There are estimated to be $20

    it does.

- en: To get the money waiting outside the door comfortable enough to come inside,
    custodian service providers (usually, certain banks) will need to accomplish the
    goal of increasing the value of assets. Thus, designing low-risk, fixed-income
    investments is high on their list. When it comes to investment banks getting into
    the space, their concern is that they would need a considerable amount of crypto
    to offset risk and increase liquidity. Often, investment banks solve this issue
    using “swap and repo”—also known as a repurchase agreement. In a typical repurchase
    agreement, a dealer sells securities to a counterparty with the agreement to buy
    back the securities at a higher price at a later date. If the dealer borrows money,
    it is a repo. If the dealer lends money, it is a reverse repo. Once the crypto
    market becomes consolidated, there will be huge demand for these transactions
    using cryptocurrency. Vocean is designing a platform to assist custodian banks
    and investment banks in profiting from these transactions.

    the demand for lenders and borrowers will increase. Zhong predicts that within
    the next twelve months, custodian banks will become a very common sight in the
    crypto market. Clients who need custodian services—such as miners or mining farms—will
    be the holders of large amounts of cryptocurrency. They’ll need reputable custodian
    services to safely take care of their crypto assets. According to a survey published
    by Reuters, one in five major financial institutions is currently considering
    trading cryptocurrency by the end of 2019\. Vocean is ready for this market.

    community) with the execution of three key steps. The first step is to build the
    platform and begin collaborating with custodian banks to migrate the asset. The
    second step will be to introduce already-existing financial products to a blockchain-based
    service. And the final step for Vocean will be to build a community of centralized
    investors to help address any issues that occur with investments.

    Vocean is building an AI system for lenders and borrowers in which the two will
    be matched by loan criteria. Such factors as ideal loan term, collateral/loan
    pair, collateral ratio, interest rate, and liquidation option will be used to
    connect the ideal lender to the ideal borrower. It will be a little like the algorithm
    of a good dating site that connects potential partners through their common interests.

    in crypto assets.

    the pace of innovation to stop, and I believe that each innovation will make the
    water feel warmer for traditional investors. But effectively applying blockchain
    technology to finance will require more than experience on Wall Street or a finance
    background. True innovators will also need a strong background in technology.
    In the case of Vocean, a team has been constructed that features leaders with
    both strong financial experience and deep roots in technology. The key person
    who is working on Vocean’s blockchain platform has been working as a core member
    of Bloomberg’s infrastructure team for over ten years. (And in my opinion, Bloomberg
    is the Google of Wall Street.) I wanted to spend so much time on Vocean in this
    chapter because I think it’s the best example of what can be accomplished when
    more and more professionals from traditional industries contribute to blockchain
    innovations. The experience and expertise they bring will make astounding things
    possible and will help ensure that blockchain become appetizing to different industries.

- en: It’s important to remember that it took the Internet over twenty years to really
    ensconce itself into our daily lives. In the early 2000s, the Internet in China
    was still very slow, and you couldn’t do much on it. Now, we simply can’t live
    without it! We Chinese are on it almost all the time (except maybe when we’re
    sleeping). Blockchain is experiencing the same adoption period. It was originally
    created as a tool to allow cryptocurrency to store transaction information. But
    now, if you look at Ethereum for example, there are over a thousand applications
    and functions available on it (in addition to storing cryptocurrency transactions).

    For example, when banks issue a mortgage to an individual so that he or she can
    make a property purchase, those banks need to verify the ownership of the property
    and also check if the customer has applied for a mortgage before. These requirements
    introduce real estate brokers into the mix, and they play a major role in the
    selling and buying of the property. But with blockchain technology, every single
    piece of property will be documented into blocks of the chain. It will be transparent
    for everyone. People will be able to go to blockchain to check this information,
    instead of to a related third party. This will save time and eliminate costs.

    to Jerry Zhong, blockchain remains popular with many hedge funds, and that popularity
    is growing. But to become a viable option for replacing the centralized system
    of storing information (in the way Wall Street would like it to), blockchain needs
    to address two major issues—regulation and safety. The regulatory status of blockchain
    is still unclear, and the safety measures currently in place are still not adequate
    for many on Wall Street. Yet I believe these are solvable problems. And with Jerry
    Zhong at the helm, I think blockchain is going to lead us into the next industrial
    revolution.
