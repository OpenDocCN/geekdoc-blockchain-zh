    country in the world. With all money being tightly regulated by the government
    and controlled by massive financial institutions, its negative effects have been
    felt in almost every sector.

- en: Just the simple fact that these large conglomerates will not have any influence
    on the use of these currencies. They can and will take a huge burden off of many
    people. Aside from the obvious, the elimination of huge fees will make a tremendous
    difference in what happens to our economy in the future. But there are other advantages
    to cryptocurrencies that you may not even realize.

    be an equalizing of funds across the world. Without these institutions managing
    and monitoring everything, more people will have a say in how their money is earned
    or spent. This can spread to numerous underprivileged countries where corporations
    dictate to less advantaged people what they can buy and how they can use it. Now,
    with peer-to-peer transactions made between only the parties involved, even the

    you think of the enormous fees that they must pay to send the money to their home.
    With cryptocurrencies, they can now make those transactions themselves and avoid
    many of those fees in the process. The amount of money saved will be astronomical.
    Imagine what good could come of that money when it is put back into the economy
    rather than in the pockets of corporations.'
