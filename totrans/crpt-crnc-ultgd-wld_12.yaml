    country in the world. With all money being tightly regulated by the government
    and controlled by massive financial institutions, its negative effects have been
    felt in almost every sector.

    on the use of these currencies. They can and will take a huge burden off of many
    people. Aside from the obvious, the elimination of huge fees will make a tremendous
    difference in what happens to our economy in the future. But there are other advantages
    to cryptocurrencies that you may not even realize.

    be an equalizing of funds across the world. Without these institutions managing
    and monitoring everything, more people will have a say in how their money is earned
    or spent. This can spread to numerous underprivileged countries where corporations
    dictate to less advantaged people what they can buy and how they can use it. Now,
    with peer-to-peer transactions made between only the parties involved, even the
    smallest user will have more say on how to spend or make their money.'

    to work for minuscule wages offered only in their immediate community. With Smart
    Contracts, they can dictate the terms of their own income and live in areas where
    they can avoid a life of poverty.'

    disadvantaged persons who have been forced to immigrate to other countries to
    make enough money to get by, you must also think of the billions of dollars they
    send from one country to the next (estimated to be more than $550 billion). Then
    you think of the enormous fees that they must pay to send the money to their home.
    With cryptocurrencies, they can now make those transactions themselves and avoid
    many of those fees in the process. The amount of money saved will be astronomical.
    Imagine what good could come of that money when it is put back into the economy
    rather than in the pockets of corporations.'

    will change the way we exchange value in many ways. While many people are still
    attached to the old system, as more people learn the benefits of cryptocurrency,
    they will definitely want to switch. With its promise of more security, more privacy,
    and more freedom of choice, it will eventually change the way we buy, sell, and
    do all sorts of transactions in the future.'

    people, the more you learn about it, the more you'll see its potential. It is
    a powerful currency that is not going to go away and eventually it will erode
    this current economic system in a way that will change the very core of how we
    do business in every corner of this planet.
