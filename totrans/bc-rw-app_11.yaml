    frameworks and models do not meet the security requirements. Furthermore, the
    lack of trust in internet-mediated transactions and unauthorized access to the

- en: There are billions of products being manufactured and supplied daily through
    complex supply chains spanning every corner of the globe. However, little is known
    about when and where these products are originated, manufactured, and used through
    their life cycle. Even before reaching the end-consumer, goods travel through
    a vast network of retailers, distributors, transporters, warehousing facilities,
    and suppliers, who participate in the design, production, distribution, and sale.
    However, in almost every case, this journey remains an unsolved riddle to the
    consumer (Jessi, Jutta, and Wood, 2016).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Supply chains are becoming increasingly more complex, more elaborate, and more
    global. An event in one corner of the world can stop production, distribution,
    or supply in another corner. When service delivery is disrupted or affected due
    to a critical factor (natural phenomenon, infrastructure failure, or counterfeit
    products), not only the supply chain, but the entire economy collapses. Not only
    do producers, sellers, distributors, consignees, and warehouses suffer financial
    loss, but it also affects the daily life of a consumer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, supply chain visibility is a major business constraint that causes most
    companies to have little or no information about their second- and third-tier
    suppliers. Incorporating transparency and visibility into the end-to-end supply
    chain can help in the flow of products from raw materials to manufacturing, testing,
    and supply of end products. This can lead to remedial measures by performing new
    types of analysis for operations, visibility, and sustainability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, operations and visibility, i.e. maintaining the flow of information
    about each product among all relevant parties requires a high level of accuracy
    in data collection and security in data storage. Currently, this responsibility
    is performed by a handful of government entities, nonprofit organizations, or
    a third party with a centralized information depository. As a unit of manufacturing
    system, such organization may misuse information with intent to coerce or harm
    either party. In addition, such agencies must have the technical capabilities
    to effectively store and handle the sensitive business information.

    chain management. Certification marks, such as ISO, ISI, FPO, Eco-mark, Organic,
    and Fair-trade are becoming vital tools to provide consumers with a better understanding
    of the product life cycle (Baier, 2005; Elder, Zerriffi, and Le Billon, 2013).
    However, the end result is just a hallmark or logo of certification printed on
    the products, assuring the common consumer that the government and the company
    have manufactured the product with utmost integrity. Although the cost of this
    certification is also borne by the consumer out of his own pocket, the consumer
    neither understands the meaning of such authentication nor can verify this information
    as the veracity of such claims made by these certificates is a costly affair,
    which requires rigorous auditing. Besides, such standards may exemplify an abuse
    of trust in the event of collusion between certification agencies and business
    establishments.

    output. A shared, consensus-based public ledger can be deployed for the supply
    chain to track the origins and processes associated with the product (Zhao et
    al., 2018). Blockchain can provide certification and documentation, including
    product lifecycle data, used in supply chain management, and make them accessible
    to all parties at once. Products can be tracked from factory to storage, transit,
    delivery, and sale. This can streamline the processes of product tracking and
    timely payment, and build trust between suppliers and customers.

    registrar provides a unique identity by registering the participants on the network.
    The standards organization sets or defines the standards for a product to be supplied
    by a manufacturing agency. An authenticator provides certificates based on their
    credentials to participants, such as manufacturers, distributors, consignees,
    warehouse in-charges, retailers, and waste management organizations, which allows
    them to write about the product specific data onto the blockchain. An overview
    of the proposed application of blockchain in the supply chain for manufacturing
    systems is shown in [Figure 11.3](#c11-fig-0003).

    it passes through different trade holders or business entities – manufacturer,
    supplier, producer, distributor, retailer – and finally reaches the end-consumer.
    Each of these units can write the relevant information of the product on a real-time
    basis on the network. This will create a unique digital profile of each product,
    and the pertinent information shall be displayed, from time to time, during every
    stage of the product life cycle. In order to streamline this process, a barcode,
    RFID, or QR code may be printed on each item, giving the product a virtual identity
    on the network. The code will be generated from a unique digital cryptographic
    identifier that will represent the digital profile of the product on the system

    registration, a pair of public and private cryptographic keys is generated for
    each participant – the public key identifies the participant within the network,
    and the private key authenticates the participant to transact with the system.
    Trading parties can interact with the network only by cryptographically authenticating
    themselves with their private keys. This ensures each product to be digitally

    for the entire life cycle of a product, beginning with the merchant who supplied
    the raw material to the end-consumer (Verhoeven, Sinn, and Herden, 2018). Whenever
    a product is exchanged between two parties, the system creates a new entry in
    the product’s profile to record the details of the transacting parties, and records
    the time of that entry as well. Since the system contains the location details
    of all the registered participants by default, it also records the location of
    the product every time a new entry is made. This information can typically be
    a unique location ID, or dynamic GPS data that can be applied across supply chains
    to determine the actual location of the product. In this way, blockchain provides
    a see-through window to everyone, from farm to fork, sharing comprehensive information

    logistics, and cryptocurrency transactions on blockchain. Perhaps this is the
    reason why many companies encourage startups to come forward and strengthen the
    brand management system of retailers, secure the flow of international trade,
    reduce the ubiquitous fees associated with financial transactions, and introduce

    LPT orchestrators and delgators in the Livepeer protocol. Livepeer also mints
    new tokens over time, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum block rewards, which are
    divided among delegators and orchestrators after every 5760 Ethereum blocks, which

    it for the time being. Using a nondefault number may result in broadcasters eliminating
    an orchestrator from consideration due to the broadcaster’s maximum ticket EV
    (which has a default that is set based on the default ticket EV).

- en: Transcoding pools can be created thanks to the split orchestrator and transcoder
    architecture. These pools are similar to PoW mining pools, which delegate PoW
    hashing to one or more individual miners. Pool operators are orchestrator operators
    in the Livepeer network, while pool participants are transcoders. Because transcoding
    pools are not part of the core protocol, the specifics of how work in a pool is
    tracked and transcoders are reimbursed are up to the pool implementation.

    orchestrators they want to send their work to, based on their preferences. The
    algorithm for picking orchestrators varies per broadcaster implementation, but
    all selection algorithms, including the default implementation in Livepeer, take
    into account the following factors:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An orchestrator’s economic security is evaluated by its total stake, which includes
    both its own self-delegated stake and the stakes of its delegators. Because the
    stake might be trimmed if the job is performed improperly, the more stake an orchestrator
    has, the more economic protection it provides to a broadcaster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default broadcaster implementation will favor orchestrators who provide
    more economic security, with the likelihood of an orchestrator receiving work
    proportionate to the orchestrator’s stake in relation to the rest of the network’s
    orchestrators. However, just because an orchestrator receives work does not guarantee
    that it will keep it; if the orchestrator does not fulfil the broadcaster’s requirements
    for other selection considerations, the orchestrator can lose the work after being
    initially selected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 11.6.2.15 Latency
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An orchestrator’s latency is the whole time it takes for it to return transcoded
    results to a broadcaster. This includes the time it takes the broadcaster to upload
    a segment to the orchestrator, the time it takes the orchestrator to transcode
    the segment (which includes network transit time between the orchestrator and
    transcoder in the case of a split orchestrator and transcoder), and the time it
    takes the broadcaster to download the transcoded results from the orchestrator.
    An orchestrator’s latency is determined by its geographical closeness to the broadcaster,
    as well as its hardware resources, which influence transcoding speed and bandwidth
    resources, which influence upload/download speed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After initial selection, the default broadcaster implementation will evaluate
    an orchestrator’s latency to determine whether or not to continue transmitting
    work to the orchestrator. The default criterion is that the transcoded results
    be received in real time, which means that the round-trip time must be less than
    or equal to the segment duration. If an orchestrator who was initially chosen
    fails to achieve this condition, the broadcaster may discontinue working with
    them, allowing other orchestrators a chance to earn employment.
