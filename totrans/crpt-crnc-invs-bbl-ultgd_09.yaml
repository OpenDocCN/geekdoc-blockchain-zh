- en: If you exchange digital currency and it is important for you to do it with the
    lowest fees, you will have to resort to services of digital currency exchanges
    (DCEs).

- en: There is also the possibility of a live exchange in person, but this option
    is not safe. There have been a lot of cases when a person has met up with another
    person to exchange Bitcoin but then gets beaten up and robbed. This risk can be
    minimized by using only the most popular DCEs, (the ones with the best reputations).
    You can find more information on the internet about the most reliable DCEs.

- en: If you still prefer to take the plunge and try your luck in a physical, digital
    currency exchange, you should know that even stolen money can be tracked. A person
    who changes money for you usually has his or her wallet installed to a mobile
    phone. When he or she transfers a specific amount of Bitcoin to your wallet, you
    can immediately go to the [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/en) site and
    check whether the transaction has really been executed.

- en: You already know that all transactions in the Blockchain network are open so
    that you can track them. To do this, enter the number of your transaction on the
    phone and wait for it to be processed. Once it is processed, you can be 99% sure
    that the money is in your wallet.

    site. Here you will find people who are willing to meet with you and make an exchange
    for cash or by bank transfer.

- en: A reliable DCE should have a website a ratings and reviews section, support
    chat, and the amounts of currency available for conversion. For example, you can
    see that this DCE offers a particular amount of Bitcoin, Ether, and cash dollars.

    to reserve the price of a currency for a certain period.

    fees on a calm market are 7%. When the market tumbles or perks up, the DCEs also
    raise fees.
