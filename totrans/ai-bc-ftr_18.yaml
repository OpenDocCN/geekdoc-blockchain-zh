- en: Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry
    and are gaining immense attention from academia as well as industry. However,
    facets of autonomous vehicle systems related to the interconnection of independent
    components pose vulnerabilities to the system. These vulnerabilities aren’t guaranteed
    to be solved by traditional security methods. Blockchain technology is a powerful
    tool that can aid in improving trust and reliability in such systems. This paper
    provides a survey on how blockchain can help improve not only security but also
    other aspects of the AV systems, focussing on the two major blockchain ecosystems
    as of this writing - Ethereum and Bitcoin. Our survey found that blockchain technology
    can assist in different use cases related to AVs, such as providing shared storage,
    enhancing security, optimizing vehicular functionalities, and enhancing related
    industries. This paper suggests directions for improvement in the sectors of Autonomous
    Vehicles (AV), which can be achieved with the incorporation of blockchain into
    Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) or individual vehicular units.

- en: Transport systems have evolved from being a status symbol to being necessary
    for the current day and age. We cannot imagine a world without the means of transport
    that we have at our disposal today. With the advancement of associated technologies,
    we see a shift to the usage of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, which
    are expected to reduce the strict operating requirements (e.g. personal driving
    license), energy usage, and environmental impact. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are
    intended to be eco-friendly and energy-conscious and provide a comfortable user
    experience, cause an increase in consumer savings, and reduce the number of traffic
    deaths. With reduced private ownership of vehicles, the value of the AV’s service
    will not be based on the brand, but on the quality of service and experience provided.

- en: However, there are specific issues that need to be addressed before AVs can
    become ubiquitous. AVs rely on trust in the sharing and communication of information
    within components of a single vehicular unit, or multiple vehicles interacting
    with each other in a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). AVs use a multitude of
    technologies to make this communication possible. The state information consists
    of combinations of location and time references of objects for precise and continuous
    position tracking related to other objects or vehicles around the AV. The working
    of the AV happens in stages - sight (sensors), communication (Vehicle-to-Everything
    (V2X) technology), and movement (actuators). Asmaa Berdigh and Khalid El Yassini
    (2017) [[4](#CR4)] give an overview of these technologies. V2V focuses on wireless
    communication of relevant information between vehicles to provide a more efficient
    driving experience, like better safety. Vehicular utilisation of multimedia services
    using V2I uses cellular network infrastructures. Intelligent Transportation Systems
    are better managed Vehicle-to-Roadside or V2R connectivity, using real-time updates
    on road statuses.

- en: The two main tasks of AVs include perception and prediction. The shared information
    and data, the signals from LiDAR, GPS, etc., are susceptible to multiple security
    threats and attacks. Apart from the data security issues, there arises the concern
    of liability management in accidents caused by AVs. Blockchain is most known for
    being extremely secure for storing data, in the sense that modifying previously
    entered data is impossible without affecting any other blocks (in the blockchain).
    Blockchain technology can offer a seamless decentralized platform where information
    about insurance, proof of ownership, patents, repairs, maintenance and tangible/intangible
    assets can be securely recorded, tracked and managed. In this paper, we survey
    the use of blockchain technology to help tackle these issues and concerns in AVs.
    We also suggest room for improvement in the current vehicular functionalities,
    and how blockchain technology can be leveraged to improve related industries.

- en: Perception in AVs happens through raw information inputted through Vehicle-to-Vehicle
    (V2V) components or sensors. The critical process of obstacle detection (to detect
    static and moving objects) is done in the perception task. Based on perception,
    AVs act by maps, weather, traffic data, topological conditions, and surrounding
    vehicles positions. Ultrasonic, LiDAR (light detection and ranging), RADAR (radio
    detection and ranging), and cameras aid in perception. Ultrasonic sensors are
    mainly used in parking sensors, and radar is only used for extremely long-distance
    tracking used for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Cameras are generally only used
    to find lane markings and display signs such as speed limits on a vehicle’s dashboard.
    The combination of RADAR and LiDAR can capture images and transfer them through
    electrical interfaces. The in-vehicle micro-computer will process the information
    acquired and analyse the data to make driving decisions by making an almost instantaneous
    3D map of the area around the vehicle. The use of the created 3D map, combined
    with GPS, is used for tackling the problem of identifying an ego vehicle’s position,
    a critical piece of information required for autonomous vehicles.

    AVs make decisions spontaneously, using quantifiable variables that estimate environmental
    factors (surrounding vehicle’s location/condition, pedestrians locations/conditions,
    vehicle occupant’s conditions, maps, weather and traffic data). It uses many sensors
    like GPS (Global Positioning System) LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging for accurate
    reliable and cost-effective mapping), RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging used
    for Adaptive Cruise Control [ACC]) and ultrasonic sensors (used for parking).
    Obstacle Detection (a crucial task) is accomplished using Computer Vision (using
    a camera that transmits captured information to in-vehicle microprocessors). Some
    suggested techniques include KITTI for pedestrian and cyclist detection, PSPnet
    by Zhao et al. (2012) [[28](#CR28)].

    with minimal infrastructural overhead. The research simulates a parking layout
    using mathematical models, defining its accessibility rate in parking place availability

    AV systems for navigation in geographical scenarios, like VANETs, ultrasounds,
    in addition to oft-used GPS and LoS (Line of Sight) with their analyses. Received
    Signal Strength (RSS), the Time of Arrival (ToA) and the Time Difference of Arrival
    (TDoA) both in anchor-based solutions and in cooperative approaches, are used
    in GPS-denied environments. One of the notable mentions in enlisting previous
    research is Roadside Units (RSUs), used to utilise AVs’ unused resources—like
    a rechargeable battery and storage capacity—using IPARK [[28](#CR28)], a system
    for guided parking over infrastructure-less VANETs.

    and trigger a protocol to resolve or avoid it. Parallel solutions generated simultaneously
    might lead to suboptimal solutions. In such cases, priority is allotted based
    on a parameter specific to the situation. For example, to avoid an impending collision
    between two autonomous cars, the car about to reach a place first should slow
    down and the other halt, instead of both the cars halting. The parameter for priority

    and thus, the attack surface of an AV is undoubtedly increased. Adversaries today

    low-cost offensive devices, can enable them to break into car security systems
    easily and in the worst case, allow complete unauthorized control of the vehicle
    or data tampering. Further, with autonomy, comes a lack of accountability. When
    autonomous vehicles are involved in accidents (collisions between themselves,
    or collisions with conventional vehicles, pedestrians or other objects), how should
    such events be recorded for forensic purposes to determine liability? Also, how

    packet fuzzing and in-vehicle spoofing. Remote access attacks include external
    signal spoofing and jamming. The security issues concerning CAVs are addressed
    in the paper by Rathee, Geetanjali, et al. (2019) [[25](#CR25)]. They have proposed
    a blockchain-based solution where each IoT device (sensor/actuator) and the vehicle
    are registered to the network before acquiring any of the services. Initially,
    the vehicular number, along with IoT device data, will be stored on the blockchain.
    Given the high amount of computation power and time needed for the large amount
    of data generated further, they propose that only the IoT devices store relevant
    information to the blockchain, which can also be analyzed. Any alteration on information
    can then easily be detected as it will alter previous records as well.

    it must first get verified by the authorised nodes. The second level consists
    of registered RSU nodes. The vehicles register with its nearby RSU, after which
    the RSU verifies the vehicle’s identity and stores it on the blockchain. The RSU
    also receives information generated by the vehicles, like traffic congestion,
    accident-related information, etc. This information is distributed to the neighboring
    roadside nodes to be validated in the blockchain network of RSUs. There exists

    Authority—are criticized in a few research papers for their inability to maintain
    the decentralization of control in the blockchain, eventually resulting in the
    concentration of power in the regions with higher computational power and resources,
    respectively. However, proposed alternatives to these, as stated in the papers,
    lack incentivization. For shared records of AV lifecycle and logs for vehicle
    sharing, each participant on the chain should verify the on-chain information
    by its existence alone. Since the verification results from the consensus mechanism,
    which operates only on the on-chain data, it follows that the data source must
    also be on-chain. These data sources must be intrinsic to the blockchain for verification
    to happen as a part of the working. Unless it is made possible to embed some kind
    of metadata in the AV records that make its source on-chain, the verification
    remains external in all systems currently proposed, rendering the consensus mechanism
    of little use by itself. Looking at the potential of blockchains as an ecosystem,
    we opine that it remains underutilised in such use cases.

    tackle many issues that AVs are expected to have seamlessly. This paper has provided
    a comprehensive literature review on the current use cases of blockchain technology
    in autonomous vehicles. We first provided an overview of autonomous vehicles,
    followed by an overview of blockchain architecture. We then investigated the current
    use cases by partitioning them into three broad groups based on blockchain usage
    in Autonomous Vehicles - as decentralized storage and security mechanism, for
    Improving AV Functionalities optimizing Related Industries. Finally, we provided
    a brief analysis of these use cases, discussing their relevance and issues. As
    a future scope, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network (LN) can be implemented for payment
    channels or primary payment rail coordination for freight chain activities. LN
    is a second-layer solution enabling Bitcoin to scale to over a million transactions
    per second (compared to 7 of Bitcoin) with payments routed peer-to-peer within
    milliseconds. As our analysis suggests, there is significant scope for the integration
    of blockchain technology in AVs. Our survey mainly indicates that more research
    needs to be conducted using blockchain for the different facets of AVs mentioned
