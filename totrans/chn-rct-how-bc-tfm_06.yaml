    every possible realm of human activity. I was thinking about this while taking
    an intercity bus in Zambia. I bought my ticket in advance at the ticket office.
    Each ticket has an assigned seat number. As we boarded the bus, staff loaded passengers’
    luggage, ranging from backpacks and suitcases to sacks of potatoes and live chickens
    bound at the legs. Food sellers crowded around the bus, peddling samosas through
    the window. The conductor checks our tickets. If an assigned seat isn’t available,
    he phones the local booking office to request a new seat number and updates the
    ticket. While the driver navigates the potholes and skirts around goats, cows
    and occasional elephants crossing the road, the conductor records which seat numbers
    are actually occupied and calls ahead to ticket offices along the route to tell
    them the seat numbers available so that they can ensure that they only sell available
    seats. The process is time consuming and leads to plenty of misunderstandings.
    With no centralized system for knowing who has bought which ticket, finding someone
    else in your seat is commonplace. Children, live chickens and sacks of potatoes
    need to be shifted around to make space.'

    hash is then appended to the Bitcoin blockchain, creating immutable timestamped
    evidence of that version of the relevant document, providing proof that a transaction
    relating to a property title occurred in the past. At any time in the future,
    a person can verify the file to confirm or refute whether or not it has been modified. One

    control the interface between the analog or offline and the digital world, sometimes
    referred to as the “bullshit in, bullshit out” problem. In other words, any blockchain
    system can only be as good as the data recorded on it. In the case of property
    registration, the challenge is in the details. For example, in the US, property
    rights vary dramatically in form from one parcel of land to another, let alone
    from county to county or state to state. Each parcel on the surface may have different
    access rights and other variants that can be difficult to understand, and even
    harder to digitize. Factor in details like height restrictions on a building or
    underground mineral rights and the concept of registering property becomes very

    handful of US states practice what is known as a Torrens system, whereby once
    a record is made within the property registration system it is considered final
    and in effect wipes out any prior claims. This negates the need for title insurance,
    as prior claims to the property are discounted once registration is approved.
    However, getting a record into this sort of system requires significant work to
    ensure the registration is legitimate. This can be expensive and cause a significant
    delay in transactions—sometimes months or even years.

    Here, the county recorder accepts any registration as long as it adheres to the
    administrative rules. They make no claim as to the quality of the registration—that
    is left to courts and stakeholders in the registration. The county recorder is
    specialized to manage what has become an immutable record of all registrations,
    legitimate or not; the judgement as to whether or not a registration is in fact
    legitimate is abstracted to the legal system. This enables individual transactions
    to occur relatively quickly, as little is required aside from administrative procedure.
    However, title insurance is then required to cover the buyer against any dormant
    claims others may have to the land or any other challenges to the legitimacy of
    the registration.

    as to the current ownership of those properties—a gargantuan task for any country.

    to equip people with the tools to digitize their own informal system. Epigraph
    is taking this approach by open sourcing a simple version of their system that
    allows anyone to use their open blockchain infrastructure to manage ownership
    among a community of likeminded property owners. A system based on this would
    enable property owners to self-register and submit proofs of ownership, and then
    make these proofs of ownership available, enabling future buyers to make their
    own judgments about the property. The burden of loading data is minimized, and

    a form to confirm interest in participating in the voting process. Others “auto-register”
    voters when an ID is secured, or other similar registration occurs. All of this

    does not get the result it seeks. While blockchain-based systems can help accurately
