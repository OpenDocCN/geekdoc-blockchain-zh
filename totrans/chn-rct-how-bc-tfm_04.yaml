    demand relationship. Demand relates to the exchange rate of fiat currency vs.
    bitcoin. But it is the computing power used to sustain the system—the proof of
    work—that in turn provides security. The greater the security, the greater the
    demand for Bitcoin and the greater are the rewards for those providing the security,
    which in turn brings more capital and more computing power. It’s a virtuous circle,

    advocate moving towards “proof of stake,” in which a network of validators deposit
    money and use it as collateral to vouch for a block. Whereas “proof of work” assigns
    value based on computer work, under “proof of stake” the value lies in the underlying

    can also submit their own transactions to the network. They are incentivized to
    listen for other users’ transactions in order to get direct, real-time access
    to the exact state of the Bitcoin blockchain—including confirmed and unconfirmed
    transactions. Only these operators know exactly what transactions have been validated

    state of transactions through various tools, these views are not nearly as trustable
    because the data will lag the true current state of the blockchain and could have

    they can have 100% certainty that their transaction is legitimate as they control
    one of the nodes. They can ensure that the software is current, the data is up-to-date,
    and the stream of transactions are validated. Without this direct visibility,
    the risk for errors, delays or outright fraud is greater. Although most users
    are comfortable with waiting for confirmation by the network, those transacting
    at high volumes are less willing to wait or take on this additional risk. Those

    a prescribed algorithm to generate a random “number only used once,” or nonce
    for short. To “win” the race to append the new block, the miner must compute a
    hash that begins with at least the same number of zeros that has been predetermined
    by the protocol, known as the target . Each miner will produce millions of attempts
    in an effort to be the first to figure out a hash below the target , and win the
    block race. Think of it as computers repeatedly pushing a button. Each push of
    the button kicks off a defined set of procedures to randomly generate the number.
    Ultimately, the effect is to eat processing power and energy from the miner’s
    system. Once a low enough nonce has been generated, that nonce is then combined
    with the hash of the current block, and hashed with the previous block, thereby
    creating the next “block” of confirmed transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

    If a rise in the number of miners competing increases their collective work, or

    “hash rate ,” then the system will make a “difficulty adjustment ,” adding more
    zeros to make the target harder, or decreasing the number to make it easier. This
    calibration occurs every 2016 blocks or roughly every two weeks.

    come to agreement every 10 minutes as to the current, validated state of the network.

    the cryptography would allow a miner to solve the function faster, this would
    present two new challenges. The first is that the winner of each block reward
    is public knowledge to all participants so, if one miner consistently wins, you
    can bet hundreds of others will dig in to understand why. Second, the difficulty
    of the hashing function to be solved is variable. The Bitcoin system is designed
    to automatically increase or reduce the level of complexity, depending primarily
    on the speed at which miners are able to solve the hash function . By hacking
    the system, a miner might speed up the process, causing the system to make subsequent
    functions more difficult. The complexity of the hashing function has increased
    over the years as computers become more and more sophisticated.

    of owning virtual cats on the blockchain, or Cryptokitties . Each token correlates
    to a specific virtual cat, with its own features, lineage and characteristics.
    Kitties can be “bred” when two token owners agree to mix the characteristics of
    a kitty they own, thereby generating a new kitty. All of this is managed by a
    token system designed to ensure visibility and accountability on all virtual mating
    or other activities. Rarer characteristics and breeds accrue value as activity
    on the system increases: some cost hundreds and even thousands of US dollars in
    fiat equivalent value at the peak of Cryptokitties craziness in 2017.'

    or initial coin offerings (ICOs). Tokens were presold to speculative investors
    who hoped the price would rocket long before the system to use the tokens was
    even built. Masses of utility tokens were created using the Ethereum protocol.
    As a result, demand for Ethereum shot up. As doubts grew about the ICO fundraising
    model, including concerns that regulators might take action against token issuers
    and promoters, the demand evaporated and prices cratered, some by more than 90%.

    fractional ownership, whereby an individual could own a very small percentage
    of an otherwise expensive asset. Tokens can be issued and managed efficiently
    at scale. Tokenization advocates believe that fractional ownership will bring
    more capital and liquidity to assets that historically have been specialized and
    create opportunities for individuals to participate in markets that they otherwise
    would be locked out of. Anyone fancy buying a 1/100,000,000th share of a commercial

    create an alternative to cash and that the stablecoin design facilitates adoption

    to be provided. There is a strong parallel here with US money market funds. These
    mutual funds were long lauded as zero risk as they directly hold cash or securities
    deemed as cash equivalents, such as very short maturity US Treasury notes. Money
    market funds traded at prices in line with their underlying value until they “broke
    the buck” during the financial turmoil of 2008—and these were funds run by large
    institutions and experienced professionals. Regardless, stablecoins have become a
    prominent feature of the crypto market since 2018 and are likely to remain relevant
