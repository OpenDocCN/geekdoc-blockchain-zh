- en: Advances in telecommunications and information technology have had a significant
    impact on the banking industry over the past few years. The rise of the financial
    technology (fintech) sector has also played an important role, with new technologies
    like blockchain having the potential to change the whole banking industry in faster
    and more disruptive ways than ever before. This chapter outlines the context of
    this study, presents the book’s structure and objective and highlights the main
    themes of all the other chapters.

- en: The banking industry has undergone considerable changes over the past few decades,
    especially because of the boom in technology that has resulted from advances in
    telecommunications and information technology (IT). These advances have transformed
    banking products, services and processes (Berger [2003](#CR1); Frame and White
    [2014](#CR5); Frame et al. [2018](#CR6)). Faster computing and the widespread
    adoption of the Internet have produced a more efficient payment system with new
    payment tools and banking services (e.g. automated teller machines (ATMs), credit
    cards, electronic payments, Internet banking, etc.), while advances in IT (both
    hardware and software) have led to more efficient and sophisticated ways for banks
    to leverage vast quantities of consumer and company data.

    with technologies that have the potential to change the whole banking industry
    in faster and more disruptive ways than ever before. In particular, recent technological
    developments have brought about financial technology (fintech) sector, which covers
    digital innovations and technology-enabled business model innovations in the financial
    arena (Philippon [2016](#CR21); He et al. [2017](#CR9); Frame et al. [2018](#CR6)).

    of fintech, it is a “technologically enabled financial innovation that could result
    in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated
    material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial
    services”. Examples of such innovations include distributed ledger technologies
    (DLTs), digital currencies, new digital advisory and trading systems, artificial
    intelligence and machine learning, peer-to-peer lending, equity crowdfunding and
    so on. According to Philippon ([2016](#CR21), p. 2), “such innovations can disrupt
    existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries, facilitate strategic
    disintermediation, revolutionise how existing firms create and deliver products
    and services, provide new gateways for entrepreneurship, democratize access to
    financial services, but also create significant privacy, regulatory and law enforcement
    challenges”. The European Banking Authority (EBA) ([2017](#CR3)) also underscores
    the potential for these new technological innovations and points out that they
    may create many benefits for consumers and organisations, including access to
    credit, improved comparability of products, access to a wider product range, availability
    of up-to-date information, tailored product offerings, reduced costs and consumer
    convenience. Thus, these innovations may contribute to a decline in costs, a reduction
    in information asymmetry and an increase in efficiency and competition and provide
    broader access to financial services by developing new ways to obtain funds. At
    the same time, however, these technologies can also pose new risks to the financial
    system, which policymakers, regulators and supervisors should consider to ensure
    the financial stability, safety and soundness of financial institutions, as well
    as consumer and investor protection.

    significantly over the past few years and experienced a massive year of investment
    in 2018, with total global investment (across venture capital (VC), private equity
    (PE) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A)), more than doubling from $54.4 billion
    in 2017 to $141.0 billion in 2018 (KPMG [2020](#CR12)). This rise was driven mainly
    by the United States, Europe and Asia, as reported in KPMG’s report ([2020](#CR12))
    on global investment trends in the fintech sector. The positive trend also continued
    in 2019, with global investment hitting $135.7 billion, a slight drop from the
    2018 results, but still more than double any year before 2018, thereby highlighting
    the strength of the global fintech market.

    (Guo and Liang [2016](#CR8); Philippon [2016](#CR21); Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR13);
    Frame et al. [2018](#CR6)), the distributed ledger technology behind Bitcoin (and
    other cryptocurrencies). It represents a key investment area of fintech (KPMG

    source of future financial market innovation (Lewis et al. [2017](#CR14)) that
    could revolutionise our society and the new world economy (McKinsey [2016](#CR18);
    Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR20); Ross [2017](#CR22)). Born as the technology underlying
    Bitcoin (Nakamoto [2008](#CR19)) to record cryptocurrencies transactions, blockchain
    has become a technology that can facilitate the process of recording any transaction
    type and track the movement of any asset, thus finding applications in multiple
    areas (Ulieru [2016](#CR24); Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR13); Yermack [2017](#CR26);
    Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR23)).

- en: Although the initial scepticism about blockchain’s original idea, i.e. blockchain
    used to launch cryptocurrencies, several financial institutions (including banks,
    insurers, etc.) around the world have focused on the DLT behind blockchain (i.e.
    blockchain without cryptocurrencies) over the past few years to examine how it
    may affect most of their business. Particularly for the banking industry, the
    reason for the growing interest in blockchain technology is its potential to create
    new opportunities for banks and because it poses new threats to their business
    (Buitenhek [2016](#CR2); McDonald et al. [2016](#CR16); Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR20);
    Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR10); Lindman et al. [2017](#CR15); Martino [2019](#CR17)).
    Many scholars and practitioners (Buitenhek [2016](#CR2); Guo and Liang [2016](#CR8);
    Peters and Panayi [2016](#CR20)) suggest that some of the problems linked to activities
    in financial services (e.g. the rising cost of operations, efficiency bottlenecks,
    transaction lags, fraud and operational risks) can be solved by applying blockchain’s
    DLT. In particular, by enabling smart contracts, maintaining immutable logs of
    transactions and facilitating the real-time execution of transactions, blockchain
    can be used to change how banks provide financial services and, consequently,
    offer potential advantages (in terms of cost, speed and data integrity) over traditional
    methods of proving ownership. In turn, this may enhance traditional financial
    institutions’ competitive edge (McKinsey [2016](#CR18); KPMG [2017](#CR11); Yermack
    [2017](#CR26)). Several of the world’s biggest banks are looking for opportunities
    in this area (i.e. blockchain’s DLT) by investing in and researching innovative
    blockchain applications. However, other studies (McDonald et al. [2016](#CR16);
    Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR10)) regard blockchain—particularly blockchain used
    to launch cryptocurrencies—as a new competitor that can threaten banks’ business.
    According to these studies, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies may allow
    consumers and suppliers to connect directly and form online networks, thus removing
    the need for “middlemen” like a bank (Holotiuk et al. [2017](#CR10)) and potentially
    undermining banks’ traditional role in verifying and enabling transactions such
    as payments. Moreover, blockchain may provide new gateways for entrepreneurship
    by making it possible for (especially fintech) start-ups to provide banking services
    at lower costs (Philippon [2016](#CR21); Tapscott and Tapscott [2017](#CR23)).
    This means that blockchain can increase competition in the industry and potentially
    undermine banks’ profitability (Yeoh [2017](#CR25)).

    and not only create opportunities for but also pose threats to banks. This is
    pushing banks to rethink their operations, business models and strategies. However,
    relevant literature is in still its infancy, and we have no clear understanding
    of blockchain technology’s potential implications for banks (Zhao et al. [2016](#CR27)).
    This book expands the literature on blockchain technology in banking by providing
    new insights into the developments, trends and challenges of blockchain in the
    banking industry. Building on the results of a previous study I conducted (Martino
    [2019](#CR17)), this book aims to shed more light on the implications of blockchain
    technology for banks, exploring the potential impact on traditional banking business
    models. To this end, the book is structured as follows.

    technology and highlights its key features, benefits and disadvantages. It also
    examines the different types of blockchain (i.e. private vs public blockchains),
    as well as their evolution (i.e. blockchain 1.0 vs blockchain 2.0 onwards). Finally,
    the chapter discusses the topic of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, which
    are the two main applications of blockchain technology.

    interviews with three professional bankers from different European banks that
    are dealing with the challenges of blockchain, and discusses the advantages and
    risks that blockchain technology can hold for banks. It also identifies the main
    banking areas that can be affected by adopting this technology.

    DLT on traditional banking business models. Building on the Business Model Canvas
    framework developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur ([2010](#CR500)), this chapter
    discusses how blockchain technology can affect all the elements of a bank’s business
    model, namely how banks generate profits, which customers they serve, which distribution
    channels they use and so on. Moreover, the chapter provides an overview of the
    current status of banks’ adoption of the technology and highlights their approach
    to handling the challenges of blockchain.

    for blockchain technology, given the crucial role of regulation in the development
    of this technology. In particular, the chapter outlines regulatory responses to
    blockchain around the world, with a specific focus on how US and EU authorities
    are tackling the key risks (e.g. privacy issues, financial crime, hacking, etc.)
    associated with this new technology. The chapter makes a distinction between the
    regulatory issues that derive from banks applying the DLT of blockchain when providing
    their services and the use of blockchain to launch cryptocurrencies, as they have
    very different implications.
