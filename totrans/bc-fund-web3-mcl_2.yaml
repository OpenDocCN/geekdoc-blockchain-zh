    institutions. This chapter explains the movements to establish trust through the
    decentralization of value, identity, and data ownership. These movements are part
    of ‘Web 3.0’, the idea that individuals rather than institutions should control
    and benefit from online social and economic activities. Blockchain technologies
    are the digital infrastructure for these movements. Blockchain technologies are
    designed for peer-to-peer online activities, with no central control. Many view
    blockchains as the best solution to some of world’s most pressing problems, from
    income disparity to climate change.'

    (object B) to collect your mail (context C) while you are on vacation (limit L),

    widen the aperture of trust to a global scale, the levels of trust are quite low

    ranked highest with over 60 percent of the respondents agreeing; the United States
    (US) hovered around 35 to 38 percent; Peru was among the lowest with under 10
    percent.^([6](#fn_6)) More recently, the 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer found that
    the majority of 33,000 global respondents believe that government leaders (57
    percent), business leaders (56 percent), and journalists (59 percent) are purposely
    misleading people by saying things they know are false. Based on an overall trust
    index that measures competency and ethical behaviors, Edelman reported significant
    drops in the index from 2020 to 2021\. For example, in the two largest economies,
    the US’s trust index dropped 18 points and China’s dropped by 5 points. According

    is the best way to restore global trust. Decentralization is the dispersion of
    functions and power to the many. Decentralized activities discourage abuses of
    power and ideally promote more inclusive participation, unity around decisions,
    and individual empowerment, freedom, and privacy. Since most of our modern social

    Blockchains are networks of computers where processing and storage of data is
    dispersed across a network, with no master computer (see [Figure 1.1](#f_1_1)).
    Each connected computer is called a ‘node’ in the network. A node is an independent
    computing entity that communicates with other nodes in a network to work together
    collectively to complete transactions and to store them in a shared system of
    record, called a ledger. Communication among the nodes is peer-to-peer.

    Cybersecurity gets stronger as more nodes are added to the network because hackers
    will need to attack more nodes.^([ii](#rfn_ii)) Scalability is another benefit—just
    add more machines to the network to get more computing power. While architectural
    decentralization offers quite a bounty of business value, but there are downsides
    as well.^([iii](#rfn_iii)) Processing is slower compared to a centralized network
    because results need to be diffused and checked by the other nodes in the network.
    Software cannot be updated unless the majority of nodes agree to adopt it—it takes
    a lot of coordination to make any changes.

    TCP/IP is still the Internet’s primary protocol used today. TCP/IP takes a copy

    of Arkansas server is 130.184.0.0/16; the IP address for the University of Wyoming
    server is 129.72.56.233\. IP addresses are not easy to remember. The Domain Name
    Service (DNS) was another important milestone. Invented in 1983, it maps an IP
    address to something more user friendly, like ‘[uark.edu](http://uark.edu)’ for
    the University of Arkansas and ‘[uwyo.edu](http://uwyo.edu)’ for the University
    of Wyoming. IP addresses and DNS are for machine-to-machine identification. Internet

    Instead, after the transfer of value is complete, the sender should no longer

    systems and regulators prevent double spending. They also mitigate other counter-party
    risks—the risk each trading party bears that the other party will not fulfill
    its contractual obligations. Banks, credit card companies, money transmitters,
    notaries, lawyers, and other trusted third parties (TTPs) provide independent
    ‘truth attestations’ such as notarizing signatures; verifying identity; verifying
    ownership; authenticating assets; and attesting those agreements have been properly

    (the advantages), for which they earn significant transaction fees (a major disadvantage).
    Transaction costs for remittances are typically between two and eight percent

    ownership; whoever is in possession of the private key is assumed to be the legitimate

    each with their own version of the transaction, must reconcile information about
    the transaction. Reconciliations are expensive and time-consuming. Once reconciled,
    there is nothing to prevent trading partners from modifying records after the
    fact; partners cannot be confident they are dealing with the same historical record
    of transactions through time. Therefore, we have millions of people with accounting

    a *blockchain*, to serve as the universal bookkeeping record to track debits and

    fuerte). People understand fiat currencies as a unit of measure; if a soda costs
    $1.25, you have a mental model of its value. However, fiat currencies have several
    disadvantages. Governments can mint fiat money at will, causing inflation and
    can change regulations on a whim (see Nakamoto’s quote above). Governments can
    also freeze, seize, or restrict access to one’s assets.^([24](#fn_24)) Criminals

    Scams included ‘phishing’, where a cyber thief poses as somebody you trust; tech

    improvement. Bitcoin has a higher price volatility compared to other major fiat
    currencies, leading to innovations like stable coins. (Although our friend Professor
    Dan Conway counters that Bitcoin is completely stable, it’s the US dollar that
    fluctuates wildly!) Bitcoin has limited functionality—it is just a payment system
    to send and receive bitcoins; it cannot do much else. Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot,
    Solana, and other blockchain platforms overcame this limitation by allowing users
    to build and operate their own decentralized applications. Bitcoin is rather pokey,
    only capable of processing about two to six transactions per second (TPS). Innovations
    in ‘layer 2’ solutions that run on top of Bitcoin (and other platforms) speed
    processing and reduce transaction fees. Bitcoin is not user-friendly, so most
    people end up relying on a trusted third party anyway, called an exchange, to
    transfer their bitcoins. Bitcoin’s protocol, called proof-of-work, is highly secure,
    but the miners who operate computers to secure the Bitcoin network consume *a
    lot* of electricity. New protocols are more energy efficient, like proof-of-stake.
    Bitcoin was designed as a standalone application, which is a long way off from

    to the first era of identity on the Internet, known as the **centralized identity
    model** (see [Figure 1.6](#f_1_6)). Centralized identity models are account based,
    requiring users to create logon IDs and passwords. Accounts and passwords date
    back to the 1960s when multiple people were sharing the same computer.^([31](#fn_31))
    It has several limitations. Most crucially, the centralized model gives institutions
    control over a user’s credentials.^([32](#fn_32)) Even when users ‘delete’ an
    account, all they have done is revoke their access privileges, as it is up to
    the institutions to decide when an account is deleted from their databases. This
    also means that our credentials are not portable across webpages. The proliferation
    of accounts and passwords is another limitation of the centralized model. By 2015,
    the average United Kingdom (U.K.) Internet user had 118 online accounts; by 2017,
    the average United States (U.S.) Internet user had 150 online accounts.^([33](#fn_33))
    Beyond the users’ inconveniences, governments and organizations also spend a vast
    number of resources managing accounts and passwords. According to a 2020 report,
    a single password reset costs, on average, $70.^([34](#fn_34))

    a single account managed by companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn,
    and others (see [Figure 1.6](#f_1_6)), called the **federated identity model**.
    While the federated model reduces the number of accounts users need to manage,
    it creates larger attack surfaces. One of the reasons that the SolarWinds attack
    was so widespread was because hackers stole federated logon credentials to access
    many systems. Federated accounts also increase institutional power over users’
    data and monetize user data for their own advantage.

    the decentralization of economic and social activities is a way to restore global
    trust, and that blockchains can serve as the digital infrastructure. We have also
    made a crucial distinction between the technology decentralization and the decentralization
    of the governance of technology. Blockchain technology is decentralized because
    each computer node in the network is a peer, with no single computer in charge.
    Blockchain governance may or may not be decentralized; each blockchain network
    has its own governance mechanism. In the next chapter, we explore the governance

    is supposed to work together to accomplish a goal. Which teams were successful,
    and why were they successful? Which teams struggled, and why? Reflect on your
    answers by grounding them in the context of decentralization (a team with no leader)
    and centralization (a team with a leader).
  prefs: []

    decisions to the many. Teams that are truly peer-to-peer lack a leader; no one
    is the ‘boss’. Everyone has autonomy and an equal opportunity to contribute their
    opinions, gifts, and talents. The major benefits of decentralization include low
    abuses of power, more inclusive participation, unity around decisions when everyone
    votes, individual freedom to act according to one’s will, and privacy to act without
    being monitored (see right side of [Figure 2.1](#f_2_1)). While these benefits
    are obvious, there are downsides to consider.

    may find it difficult to assemble the fragmented works of individuals into a coherent

    and accountability. Team members have someone to rely upon to take responsibility
    for the overall success of the team. These are the benefits of centralization

    over-monitoring. These are the major concerns expressed by the global blockchain
    community, and why, on balance, many open-source communities favor decentralization—not

    solution. Decision making rights might be held by benevolent dictatorships; oligarchies;
    stakeocracies; federations; representative meritocracies; meritocracies; and/or
    democracies. These governance models have varying degrees of (de)centralization,
    and as we learned in [Figure 2.1](#f_2_1), offer various benefits and risks. In
    [Figure 2.2](#f_2_2), we map eight blockchain governance models along the decision-making
    power continuum. Thus, a benevolent dictator who controls everything is the most
    centralized blockchain governance model; a democracy where every person gets an
    equal vote is the most decentralized. Each governance model is described below
    and in [Table 2.1](#t_2_1).

    holds decision making rights. The community must trust the person or organization
    to make decisions based on the best interests of the community. Initially, Satoshi
    Nakamoto over the Bitcoin whitepaper and Bitcoin Core, and Vitalik Buterin over
    the idea for Ethereum, are examples of benevolent dictators over public blockchains.^([2](#fn_2))
    These projects succeeded because the earliest of adopters—typically other like-minded
    coders—trusted the founders’ intentions, even in the interesting case of Bitcoin
    where the identity of Nakamoto isn't known. Nathanial Popper, reporter for the
    *New York Times*, wrote, *“Satoshi’s anonymity, if anything, seemed to increase
    the level of faith in the system. The anonymity suggested that Bitcoin was not
    created by a person seeking personal fame or success.”*^([3](#fn_3)) As we will
    see, these benevolent dictators moved quickly to disperse their powers.

    Chronicled is the neutral facilitator over MediLedger. Susanne Somerville, CEO
    of Chronicled and co-founder of MediLedger, said, *“A neutral facilitator, who
    can establish trust among parties, can serve as a benevolent dictator—at least
    initially—because they are incentivized to solve the problem for everyone.”*

    each gets one vote. That’s why many people like the fact that Bitcoin and Ethereum
    miners ‘vote’ by either installing or failing to install changes to the source
    code. Focusing on Bitcoin, once proposals are reviewed and supported by Bitcoin
    developers, miners may be asked to vote using the following process: *“The proposal
    itself typically sets the requirements for agreement and adoption. For example,
    the proposal may say that a certain change requires the approval from a super-majority
    of miners (a typical number is 95%) during a given period (measured in blocks).
    Miners signal their support for a proposal by adding a line to the blocks they
    solve. Once the threshold is achieved, the proposal is said to be locked in, and
    it is activated at a predetermined later date.”^([13](#fn_13))* However, a miner’s
    vote is non-committal. It’s more akin to a political pole as to how one intends
    to vole in an election. *“It is possible for proposals to secure support from
    many miners and still be dropped. An example was the 2017 proposal called SegWit2x,
    which secured support from 100% of miners but was later dropped due to lack of
    consensus among different Bitcoin stakeholders.”^([14](#fn_14))*'

    there is no one else to delegate power to yet. If governance remains centralized
    as is often the case with private blockchains, it needs to be trusted and transparent

    15 percent of the ether money supply. In June of 2016, a hacker (or hackers) exploited
    a weakness in the smart contract’s code. He, she or they began draining the DAO’s
    funds. The Ethereum community was powerless to stop it, as smart contracts run
    autonomously. The hacker syphoned $50 million in ether into another account. Vitalik
    Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, called for a complete stop in trading until

    third party to provide truth attestations, that is, to verify information about
    the parties, assets, and transactions. The trusted third party provides vital
    services to facilitate trade; that is why our four trading parties rely upon it.
    The TTP provides **clear control and accountability***.* The trading parties have
    an identifiable institution to address questions, concerns, or complaints. Additionally,
    trading partners **can alter agreements** as new information becomes available
    or as circumstances change. However, the TTP can command significant fees for
    such services. Let’s assume the four trading parties pay, on average, five percent
    of the value of each transaction to the TTP for these services. As a benchmark,
    in more complex scenarios like remittances and global supply chains, **transaction
    costs can be high,** between eight and 22 percent of the value of the transaction.^([66](#fn_66))

- en: In our simple scenario, the network is centralized, with the TTP at its center,
    routing information to and from the four trading partners. Each party also maintains
    its own independent information to compare with what the TTP sends. (Think of
    it as keeping track of your own purchases and comparing your paper receipts with
    the credit card statement you receive from the bank.) Each party maintains its
    own systems to record debits, credits, and other data on their private ledgers
    (represented by different patterned database icons in [Figure 2.5](#f_2_5)). Each
    party benefits from controlling their own software and ledgers—each party can
    swiftly and unilaterally execute decisions. Each party can modify its records
    and alter its software as it sees fit. But there are downsides to independent
    record keeping in the context of trading relationships. In our little ecosystem,
    each party spends significant resources protecting their IT perimeters against
    cybersecurity attacks, which we called **brute force cybersecurity defense**.
    Among the four trading partners and one TTP in our scenario, there are five **versions
    of the truth** which need to be reconciled. Even after reconciliation, nothing
    prevents a party from rewriting history after-the-fact. Because each party can
    modify its own records, partners cannot be confident they are dealing with the
    same historical record of transactions through time, thus hindering the ability
    to uniformly trace the origin of an asset and every change to its status over
    time (called ‘data provenance’). Reconciliations, in turn, slow settlement times.
    In a more realistic scenario than an ecosystem with just five parties, such as
    trade finance, the knotwork of players involved—customers, suppliers, banks, customs,
    transporters, and warehouses—may take weeks to settle transactions.^([67](#fn_67))

    Each party has to work with the trusted third party to assess the status of a
    transaction. In more complex scenarios, some parties spend days or weeks tracking
    down the status of a transaction. Consider cross-border payments; when a manufacturer
    in one country sends payment to a supplier in another country, the manufacturer
    and the supplier’s financial institutions, national payment systems, and corresponding
    banks process the transaction. Parties to an exchange have no access to the status
    of the transaction, the fees being charged, or even which institution controls
    a transaction as it works its way through the knotwork.

    the mission/vision; funding model; rights of participation; rights of validation;
    rights of overrides, and governance residence. We’ve learned that trading with
    a blockchain has many benefits, but also some downsides to consider. Overall,
    blockchains can be trusted if there are enough independent nodes in the network
    to secure it (decentralized architecture) and if the decision-making powers are
    dispersed among an incentivized community (decentralized governance) or if the
    few people in power are trusted and transparent (centralized governance). In the
    next chapter, we will look at the component parts of a blockchain application.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we develop a framework to explain the component parts of a
    blockchain application. A blockchain application comprises protocols, code bases,
    use cases, and application interfaces (see [Figure 3.1](#f_3_1)). For a given
    blockchain application, **protocols** serve as the blueprints. A blockchain application
    has blueprints for the distributed ledger, native digital assets, cryptography,
    consensus, and smart contracts. Protocols are normally explained in a white paper
    so that potential adopters can understand the purpose and design choices made.
    Once rules are established, protocols are programmed into **code bases**, like
    Bitcoin core, Ethereum core, EOS, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, Quorum, Chain or
    Multichain. Code bases are published as open-source software, typically on Github.
    From there, a code base can be adapted for a particular **use case**, like tracking
    items in a supply chain, cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) or
    voting. Finally, all blockchain applications have **interfaces** where users access
    the system.

    application; it is a decentralized network with a single primary application,
    namely, peer-to-peer payments. Ripple launched in 2014 and Stellar launched in
    2015; both are blockchain networks with a single primary application, namely,
    currency exchanges for global payments. The launch of Ethereum in 2015 heralded
    the era of blockchain platforms. Now, most new public blockchain applications
    are launched on top of an existing platform by coding a new smart contract. Developers
    piggyback on top of the network that has been programmed for them, allowing them
    to take advantage of the existing network infrastructure. In addition to Ethereum,
    popular blockchain platforms include Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, EOS,
    and Binance Smart Chain.

    the application, but existing code bases help to speed the process. Private blockchains
    are commonly built using Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or Quorum code bases. For
    example, Walmart Canada’s DL Freight and the IBM Food Trust are built in Fabric;
    both applications are featured in subsequent chapters.

- en: A blockchain application is a peer-to-peer (decentralized) network for validating,
    timestamping, and permanently storing transactions on a shared ***distributed
    ledger***. ***Digital assets***, native to each blockchain application, are programmable,
    exist only in digital form, and come with rights of use. ***Consensus*** algorithms
    validate transactions, update the ledger, and keep copies of the ledger in sync.
    ***Cryptography*** helps to secure the network. Most blockchains use ***smart
    contracts*** that apply rules to automatically execute transactions based upon
    pre-agreed conditions.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A ledger is a record of transactions. Your monthly bank account statement is
    an example of a report from your bank’s ledger. A bank statement lists all the
    receivables coming into your account (credits) and payments you made (debits)
    in a timed sequence. The summation of all transactions over time results in your
    account balance. A blockchain application has a ledger that records all debits
    and credits for each account, or to be more precise, for each public ‘address’.
    Blockchain ledgers also store and execute smart contracts, so a blockchain ledger
    is more complex than a simple bank account statement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why use a ***distributed*** ledger? Why not use a super secure spreadsheet or
    a traditional database? Spreadsheets and traditional databases are controlled
    by one party who can decide to add, modify, or delete records, and who can approve
    or deny access to others. A blockchain ledger is peer-to-peer technology, meaning
    that the parties share independent copies that are synchronized. After entries
    are validated and added to the ledger, no one party can modify it, delete it,
    or deny the other party access to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Protocols define the structure of the distributed ledger. The most common structure
    is a ***chain of blocks***—thus the name ‘blockchain’ (see [Figure 3.2](#f_3_2)).
    With a blockchain structure, recently approved transactions are sequenced and
    collected into a block. Each block comprises a header and a set of sequenced transactions.
    The block header includes a pointer to the previous block of transactions, forming
    a chain of sequenced blocks over time, all the way back to the first block, called
    the ‘genesis block’. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric structure
    their digital ledgers as blockchains.

    the other, through a process of continual ledger close. A completely new ledger
    is created every few seconds in such a way that the most current version could
    be reconstructed from all the prior versions. Ripple and Stellar use this structure.
    Their ledgers are more complex than Bitcoin’s ledger because they maintain account
    settings, balances, trustlines and different types of transactions like sell offers,
    payments, and cancel offers. The account balances are updated with the most recent
    set of validated transactions. [Figure 3.3](#f_3_3) shows how a ledger gets updated.

    functions as fiat money, namely as a medium of exchange for the payment of debts;
    as a common measure of value; and as a store of value that should retain its worth
    over time. As we learned in [Chapter 1](chapter01.xhtml), we call these ***cryptocurrencies***—digital
    currencies that are secured by cryptography, which makes them nearly impossible

    that is secured by cryptography. Crypto-tokens can be used to represent ***fungible***
    (non-unique) assets, such as loyalty rewards and airline frequent flyer miles
    in which one token is interchangeable with another. Stable coins are also examples
    of fungible crypto-tokens; stable coins peg the crypto-token to a stable asset
    outside of the blockchain network, such as pegging a digital token to a fiat currency
    or to commodity like gold or a barrel of oil. Crypto-tokens can be used to represent
    ***non-fungible*** (unique) assets where the token represents a particular asset
    in the real world. These are called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For example, a
    unique token could be created to represent a particular diamond, a particular
    medical device, a particular plot of land, or a particular work of art. Subsequent
    chapters will dive more deeply into stable coins and NFTs.'

    nodes to validate transactions and to constantly re-check the integrity of the
    ledger’s records. For many public blockchains, native digital assets are a way
    to compensate participants for securing the network. Bitcoin, Ethereum 1.0 and
    Monero, for example, reward validator nodes with native digital assets.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**4\. Efficient network usage.** Native digital assets can be used to discourage
    people from over-using a shared resource by requiring or encouraging senders to
    include a fee to submit transactions to the network. Ethereum, for example, uses
    its native digital asset ‘ether’ to pay for specific actions on the blockchain
    network. The fee is called a ‘gas fee’, and the fee varies based on the computational
    intensity of the transaction and on the busyness of the network. Bitcoin’s fee
    is optional, but miners’ computers are highly unlikely to select a transaction
    with no fees. One can think of it this way: does a waitress have any incentive
    to serve a customer who has told her he will not tip?'

    Let’s first consider the programmability of fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies).
    Whereas the US Federal Reserve^([iii](#rfn_iii)) determines monetary policy for
    the US dollar, anyone can create a native digital asset and decide upon its monetary
    policies. There are multiple ways to create your own digital asset. Initially,
    new coins were created by downloading the Bitcoin Core, altering the programming
    code, and launching a ‘fork’ (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml)) to Bitcoin. These
    are called ‘altcoins’ because they are alternative coins to Bitcoin. Today it
    is more common to launch a new digital asset by using a smart contract on an existing
    platform like Ethereum. When a new token is launched, the native digital asset’s
    monetary policies and functionality are pre-programmed. Basic monetary policies
    to consider include the money supply, token distribution, transferability, and
    divisibility (see [Table 3.1](#t_3_1)). It’s fascinating to consider how one might
    craft a monetary policy that results in a valuable digit asset. What policies
    would you choose?'

    banks, such as dictating the percentage of deposits the banks must keep in reserve
    and the rates at which banks can borrow money from the Fed. Lowering the reserve
    ratio or interest rate increases the money supply. The Fed can also increase the
    money supply by buying back treasury bonds, which puts more cash in circulation.
    The Fed reports monthly upon the total money supply using several formulas. For
    example, the M1 formula includes currency in circulation and checking account
    balances. The M1 money supply dramatically increased during the COVID-19 pandemic

    output. Given a specific input, the identical output will always be reproduced.
    A good hashing algorithm makes it practically impossible to determine the input
    value based on the output value, which is why hashes are called ‘one-way’ functions.
    Blockchains use hashes in many places to add layers of security. Public keys are
    hashed into addresses; addresses and amounts within a transaction are hashed to
    create a unique and secure transaction ID; transaction IDs within a block are
    hashed together multiple times to produce a Merkle Root that resides in a block
    header; and all the data in the block header is hashed to create a unique and
    secure block ID. SHA-256 is an example of a hashing algorithm.

    It was designed by the US National Security Agency. It takes any-sized input value

    notation. The output looks randomly generated, but the same input will always
    produce the exact same output. [Figure 3.8](#f_3_8) shows three examples. The
    first example transformed the name ‘MaryLacity’ into a 32-byte output. The second
    example, ‘Marylacity’, merely changed a capital ‘L’ to a small ‘l’, yet the output
    is completely different from the first example. The third example shows how a

    scenario. Assume you are hanging out with three of your friends and you all want
    to order a pizza. When you pool your money, you only have enough funds to buy
    a large pizza with one topping. How do you decide which pizza topping to order?
    You and your friends might invoke several processes, i.e., protocols, for selecting
    the topping. Perhaps you agree that you all get an equal vote, but with four people
    voting, four toppings might be proposed, or tie votes (2-2) might occur, so you
    need another consensus method. Perhaps you and your friends have previously agreed
    to take turns picking a topping. It happens to be your turn, but you won’t get
    to pick the topping again until your friends have ordered three more pizzas. This
    method is analogous to the consensus protocol known as Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance (PBFT). Perhaps the choices are weighted by the amount of money each
    person pitched in—this method is analogous to the consensus protocol known as
    Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Perhaps you hold a contest—the first person who gets the
    order in online wins, and the rest of the friends stop ordering when the winner
    confirms the order was accepted by the restaurant. This is analogous to the Proof-of-Work
    (PoW) consensus used by Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0.

    an ancient city (i.e., before phones were invented). The only way the divisions
    can communicate is by sending a messenger (See [Figure 3.13](#f_3_13)). To take
    the city successfully, all the divisions must attack at the same time. If only
    some of the divisions attack, they will be slaughtered. How can the entire army

    might be a traitor? In their metaphor, a Byzantine General represents a computer
    node; most generals and messengers are loyal (i.e., not faulty) but some generals
    and messengers are traitors (i.e., faulty). Lamport et al. (1982) proved that

    of the asset (based on the owner’s digital signature with their private key) and
    check that the asset has not been given away before by scanning the digital ledger,

    Nakamoto needed a way to find independent verifiers to validate transactions and
    add blocks to the blockchain without relying on trusted third parties. Nakamoto
    proposed to reward other nodes in the network with newly issued bitcoins when
    they validate all recently submitted transactions and create the next block. So
    that validator nodes take the task seriously, Nakamoto proposed a competition
    among computer nodes in the blockchain network to be the first to collect recently
    verified transactions into a block and then to find an acceptable block identification
    number (known as the blockhash) for the next block in the blockchain. It’s not
    easy to find an acceptable number—it takes a lot of computing power to perform
    the brute force guesses to find a hash number that is less than the current mining
    ‘difficulty’ (explained below). The difficulty is part of the proof that the miner’s
    computer did a significant amount of work to earn the block reward. The proof-of-work
    protocol creates a highly secure ledger, as an attacker would need to gain control
    of more than 50 percent of the processing power of the network, rewrite history

    account, or other methods. Participants in the blockchain can estimate with some
    certainty which member will likely be the next validator. A proof-of-stake process
    uses much less energy than a proof-of-work process. It creates a highly secure
    ledger, as an attacker would need to gain control of more than 50 percent of the
    cryptocurrency to rewrite the ledger. However, critics claim it is less secure
    than proof-of-work because people with small stakes have little to lose by voting
    for multiple blockchain histories, which leads to consensus never resolving.^([29](#fn_29))
    Also, some fear that with PoS, the rich will get richer and the poor will get
    poorer. The rich are more likely to stake their money and therefore be selected
    to create a block, thus increasing their wealth with more stake rewards, which
    might lead to central control of the network. Supporters of PoS disagree. For
    example, Ryan Adams argued that wealth grows proportionally. He wrote, *“the rich
    increase their wealth from 100 to 110, and the poor increase their wealth from
    10 to only 11\. However, since there are 10 poor stakers for every 1 single rich
    staker, the percentage share in the network does not change. Therefore, decentralization
    is not compromised.”^([30](#fn_30))*'

    each other, with each node operator staking their reputation that they will behave
    properly. Each round, a node from the member list is selected as leader (see [Figure

    a transaction. The leader node multicasts the request to all the other authorized
    nodes. The authorized nodes execute the request independently and then send to
    each other and reply to the client. The client waits for a certain percentage
    of replies to confirm validation, typically waiting for 2/3 of the nodes to agree.

    software that stores rules for negotiating the terms of a contract, automatically
    verifies the contract and then executes the terms.”^([32](#fn_32))* Anything that
    can be coded with clearly specified rules, can be coded into a smart contract
    that is secured and permanently stored on a blockchain. Ethereum was the first
    major blockchain to include full smart contracting capabilities, thus escalating
    blockchains from peer-to-peer payment systems to platforms that can execute machine-to-machine
    agreements. By January 2020, over 1,000,000 contracts were running on Ethereum,
    but many of these were simple little contracts such as ‘hello world’.^([33](#fn_33))
    In 2022, the most widely used smart contracts were for decentralized exchanges
    (DEX), including Uniswap, SushiSwap, Bancor Network, Ether Delta and Airswap.^([34](#fn_34))

- en: 'The term ‘smart contract’ does not mean that the contract is a legally binding
    contract; it’s more accurate to think of it as a small computer program that codifies
    agreed upon rules. Smart contracts’ magic (and danger) is that once deployed,
    they execute automatically and cannot be stopped. Therefore, parties must decide
    in advance on all the terms of the agreement before deploying it. Smart contracts
    are commonly used to automatically move value around accounts based on agreed
    upon conditions. As we shall see, use cases abound: lotteries; voting; crowdsourcing;
    asset sharing (lookout Uber, Airbnb, and Spotify); asset tracking; identity management;
    bidding; rating; gaming; and gambling. In general, smart contracts can be classified
    as either deterministic or non-deterministic.'

    the blockchain, can execute autonomously without the need for any outside information.
    A lottery is a good example. A smart contract for a lottery could define the time
    period when people could send value to the smart contract public address to buy
    lottery tickets. The smart contract could specify how the winning lottery number
    would be selected, perhaps by taking the hash of a randomly selected block and
    awarding the address that is closest to that number as the winner. The smart contract
    could automatically transfer the money to the winning address. If the lottery
    was regulated, the smart contract could be coded to deduct taxes.'

    to execute the contract. Horse race betting is an example. Like a lottery, a smart
    contract for horse race betting could be coded to define when people could send
    value to the smart contract account to place their bets. The rules for adjusting
    odds could also be mechanized in the contract. However, smart contracts for horse
    racing cannot run autonomously; they need outsiders (called ‘***oracles***’) to
    inform the smart contract of the winning animal. Unlike trusted third parties,
    an oracle in this scenario does not control the funds, the smart contract does.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Code bases can be used to develop *blockchain use cases,* i.e., applications.
    What makes a blockchain use case worthwhile? We have already discussed that distributed
    ledgers are preferred when centralized control is not wanted. Now let’s refine
    the reasoning. ‘Distributed databases’ is an umbrella term that encompasses many
    different architectural designs where data is stored in multiple places and where
    agreement is maintained through computer algorithms that lock and time stamp records.
    Given that definition, we see that ***blockchains are distributed database systems,
    just of a special kind***. Whereas traditional distributed databases are centrally
    controlled so that a single organization can decide to alter records or access
    rules, blockchains are distributed—no one entity has the power to roll back or
    alter history. Under what circumstances is the distributed control of blockchains
    preferable to the centralized control of traditional databases? The answer depends
    on the ‘trust boundary’ (see [Figure 3.17](#f_3_17)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the nodes in a traditional distributed database environment trust each other,
    and therefore fewer verifications are required.^([46](#fn_46)) Trust is not presumed
    among nodes in a blockchain distributed ledger, so every event must be checked
    and rechecked, which is one reason why traditional distributed databases are magnitudes
    faster than blockchains.^([47](#fn_47)) Other experts also point to the inclusion
    of smart contracts as a distinguishing feature and advantage of blockchains over
    distributed database systems.

- en: There are countless circumstances when parties do not trust each other. Trying
    to account for the number of blockchain use cases is as pointless as asking, *“what
    can I use the Internet for?”* The possibilities are limitless. [Figure 3.18](#f_3_18)
    provides examples of use cases across industries collected from press announcements
    and Google alerts. Firms from the financial services industry were the first to
    take serious notice of blockchain’s opportunities and threats, and therefore have
    explored more use cases than other industries. Insurance, healthcare, supply chain,
    media and entertainment and governments are quickly catching up, and new applications
    arise daily. Decentralized finance (DeFi) and metaverses are relatively new, but
    exploding in terms of investment and deployments. It’s exciting to contemplate
    all the application use cases that will emerge that we cannot envision today.
    Perhaps YOU will be the person to create the next killer app!

    Pool and it is propagated to the other nodes in the Bitcoin Network. In general,
    each node is directly connected to about eight other nodes, and quickly, the Bitcoin

    the mining nodes are also grabbing valid transactions from the Memory Pool to
    try to create the next block. The nodes select the transactions with the highest
    transaction fees first; the nodes grab as many transactions as can fit into the
    maximum block size (initially set by Nakamoto at 1MB per block, later increased
    by SegWit). Thankfully, the network is not busy today, so Jennifer’s modest offer
    of 35 cents worth of bitcoin is enough for the miners to grab it.

    The first mining node to find an acceptable block identification number (known
    as the blockhash) to place on top of the distributed ledger is the winner. It’s
    not easy to find an acceptable number*—*it takes a lot of computing power to perform
    the brute force guesses to find a hash number that is less than the current mining
    ‘difficulty’.^([xi](#rfn_xi)) The difficulty is part of the proof that the miner’s
    computer did a significant amount of work to earn the block reward. [Figure 3.24](#f_3_24)

    miners to include their transactions in the block, including Jennifer’s 35 cents
    worth of bitcoins. This total reward that goes to the miner is always the first
    transaction in a block. All the other nodes check the new block and the process

    the entire Bitcoin network agree that your address, 31uEbMgunupShBVTewXjtqbBv5MndwfXhb,
    has .001 bitcoins in it? Bitcoin’s settlement is probabilistic rather than deterministic.
    Although a new block is created on average every ten minutes, the actual settlement
    time is longer due to the possibility of a temporary divergence of the network.
    Sometimes two miners create the next block at the same time, resulting in two
    versions of the top of the ledger. For a short while, different nodes in the network
    work off different branches of the ledger until one branch is established as the
    longest and therefore the valid branch. To confidently consider a bitcoin transaction
    to be settled, it is generally recommended to wait until the transaction is six
    blocks deep, which on average takes an hour. Thereafter, you can be secure that
    the whole network agrees you own the bitcoin because it’s locked in and visible
    for the world to see on the ledger.

    code bases, use cases, and application interfaces. We took a closer look at the
    protocols associated with distributed ledgers, native digital assets, cryptography,
    consensus and smart contracts. Hopefully, readers can now comprehend the definition

- en: A blockchain application is a peer-to-peer (decentralized) network for validating,
    timestamping, and permanently storing transactions on a shared **distributed ledger**.
    **Digital assets**, native to each blockchain application, are programmable, exist
    only in digital form, and come with rights of use. **Consensus** algorithms validate
    transactions, update the ledger, and keep copies of the ledger in sync. **Cryptography**
    helps to secure the network. Most blockchains use **smart contracts** that apply
    rules to automatically execute transactions based upon pre-agreed conditions.

    (i.e., it’s the architecture for decentralization), the ‘what’ of blockchains

    next chapter, we will look at ‘who’ is investing in, creating and using blockchain
    technologies.

    trust in online economic and social activities through the decentralization of
    the exchange of value, identity, and data ownership. We understand that blockchains
    are the architecture of decentralization, and how all the component parts work
    together to process exchanges of value without intermediaries. We’ve also covered
    the governance of blockchains—who holds decision making rights over blockchain
    networks. These lessons are foundational to understanding *how* blockchains work.

    lawyers, and more. Every reader, regardless of their background, can contribute

    leaders in investment and adoption, and other enablers of Web 3.0 (see [Figure
    4.1](#f_4_1)). We examine the explosion of innovations that followed Bitcoin,
    creating a global market worth trillions of dollars. Within this market, innovations
    include exchanges, stable coins, privacy coins and NFTs. These innovations are
    quickly combining with other technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), artificial
    intelligence, and virtual reality to create entirely new innovations like metaverses.
    Technologies will also combine in ways we cannot yet predict.

    regulatory guiderails we need for safe and equitable adoption. Standards aim to
    make technologies interoperable so that we can exchange assets seamlessly *across*
    blockchain networks, not just within them. We don’t want to get trapped by a single
    supplier, called ‘vendor lock-in’. Laws and regulations are also needed. Well-designed
    laws and regulations protect investors, consumers, and the environment without
    stifling innovation. Regulations from the State of Wyoming serve as our prime
    example of crypto-friendly laws that protect investors.

    on virtual currencies, prompting other governments to consider banning virtual
    currencies. This caused uncertainty among crypto-holders, so they began exiting
    the market. The second theory asserts that Bitcoin’s price was manipulated by
    one or more ‘whales’—individuals with large bitcoin holdings of over $1 billion
    in value. Whales can sell a large enough portion of their bitcoins at a lower
    than market price to prompt a panic sell-off, which lowers the price further.^([1](#fn_1))
    When the price falls low enough, the whales swoop in and buy more bitcoins at
    a reduced price. Prices rise soon after. Two university professors suspect that
    a single Bitcoin whale manipulated prices in 2017.^([2](#fn_2)) Another explanation:
    with Bitcoin rising in value by over 200 percent between October and December
    of 2017, along with other cryptocurrencies rising as well, analysts argued that
    the market became unsustainable due to the influx of new investors to the cryptocurrency

    later to no longer accept bitcoins as payments for its cars prompted a crash.^([4](#fn_4))
    Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said he was concerned about Bitcoin’s effect on the environment.
    The Chinese government, which had banned ICOs back in 2017 and banned cryptocurrency
    mining in 2019, finally banned all crypto trading in May 2021.^([5](#fn_5)) That

    data storage, adding functionality, decreasing settlement times, or to serve different

    was created by seven people, but it is primarily associated with ‘Nicolas van
    Saberhagen’, a pseudonym used by the creator of the CryptoNote privacy protocol.
    Some people speculate on chat forums that Nicolas van Saberhagen and Nakamoto
    are the same person!^([34](#fn_34)) Monero, launched in 2014, is a cryptocurrency
    with increased data obfuscation compared to Bitcoin using ring signatures^([35](#fn_35))
    and stealth addresses. The public ledger hides addresses and amounts, yet still
    functions to prevent the double spend. We’ll explain the mechanics in a subsequent

    Song from the University of California at Berkeley leads the project. She built
    the Oasis Network on the Cosmos protocol that uses Proof-of-Stake to allow both
    privacy and scalability. One of its privacy features is the ability for smart
    contracts to process end-to-end transactions using secure enclaves, meaning privacy
    happens at the hardware level.^([38](#fn_38)) A secure enclave *“provides* *CPU
    hardware-level isolation and memory encryption on every server, by isolating application

    programmable, so the terms may vary from ownership of an asset to limited uses
    such as the right to display the asset on social media, but the creator keeps
    copyright/ownership. So, in the NFT world, we must be careful to separate technical
    functionality (control over an NFT by possessing the private key) from legal ownership
    as defined by law and which varies by jurisdiction.

    It runs on Ethereum. Launched by Dapper Labs in 2017, it allows users to buy,
    trade, and breed virtual cats, each of which is unique and secured with an NFT.
    If you buy two CryptoKitties on the marketplace^([iii](#rfn_iii)), you can breed
    them to produce a new CryptoKitty; a new kitty with its own ‘cattributes’, secured
    with its own NFT. (If you only own one CryptoKitty, you can breed it with a public
    sire.) Owners can describe the personality of their CryptoKitty. For example,
    the description of Kitty number 540245, called Salaam, is, *“I’ve never told anyone
    this, but I once danced for a dog. My enemies describe me as ‘brilliant’. It’s . . . accurate.

    with enough ether to buy a Kitty and to pay gas fees to Ethereum miners to process
    sell, trade, or breed transactions. The smart contract processes the transactions
    and permanently stores them on Ethereum’s digital ledger.^([iv](#rfn_iv)) It’s
    important to realize that the digital image of the kitty is stored offchain and
    the art is owned by Axiom Zen (owners of Dapper Labs). So what good is an NFT?

    of thousands of transactions on the Ethereum network. CryptoKitties started using
    10 percent of Ethereum’s network capacity by November of 2017.^([45](#fn_45))
    CryptoKitties offers a few lessons. First, many new markets often start with gamers,
    who are looking for fun and who are less risk averse than average consumers. Second,
    it shows the market potential for virtual products—people are willing to use cryptocurrencies
    to pay for virtual things. Third, it shows the power of blockchain platforms because
    new NFT apps can be deployed for very little investment.

    private-permissioned blockchains including those built on Fabric, Quorum, Corda,

    investments, such as running a node. Enterprises also build and use apps on public
    blockchains, most commonly Ethereum.^([68](#fn_68)) Enterprise adoption of public
    blockchains will likely increase as new protocols (like the Baseline Protocol)

    often within the same industry, must work together to plan for solutions that
    meet the needs of all. To comply with anti-trust laws, companies can join a working
    group/consortium, which is an association of companies formed for a common purpose,
    but with clear rules to comply with anti-trust laws. Working groups/consortia
    are associations with ‘lightweight’ legal rules, often formed with a simple Memorandum
    of Understanding (MoU) that outlines terms such as not discussing pricing strategies
    (which would violate anti-trust) and the intellectual property (IP) rights of
    the IP created by the group. Since members are free to exit, companies only stay
    engaged if they perceive the group is making progress.

    savings; to accelerate learning; to share risks; to build a critical mass of adoption;
    to maintain relevance; and to influence standards.^([69](#fn_69)) By 2020, there
    were over 220 major blockchain consortia. Consortia are helpful for exploring
    use cases and building proof-of-concepts, which are test systems that do not serve
    as official records, but fewer than five percent of consortia ever implemented
    a production application.^([70](#fn_70)) Many consortia disbanded due to the lack
    of a compelling business case, a misalignment of incentives, and other competing
    priorities, like dealing with crises prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.^([71](#fn_71))

    a legislator and a regulator? How are laws and regulations made? For the sake
    of this discussion, we’ll start with the federal government of United States,
    but the answers will differ by country. The US Federal legislative branch, called
    the US Congress, comprises the House of Representatives (currently 435 representatives)
    and the Senate (two senators per US state). Only a representative can propose
    a new law, which is called a ‘bill’. When the representative gets enough support,
    the bill is read to the House of Representatives, and the speaker of the House
    sends the bill to one of the standing committees. The standing committee reviews,
    seeks expert opinions, debates, and revises the bill. Once the standing committee
    approves the bill, it goes back to the House of Representatives for debate and
    proposed changes. The House votes upon it. If the majority vote yes, the bill
    passes to the Senate for the same process (committees, debates, and changes).
    If the majority of the senators vote yes, the bill is passed to the US President.
    If the President signs the bill, it becomes a law. If the President vetoes the
    bill, it goes back to Congress where it can still become a law if 2/3 of the representatives
    and 2/3 of the senators vote in favor of it.^([96](#fn_96)) Very few bills make
    it pass the first step, let alone becoming a law. The legislative process is slow
    in a democracy, which is one of the reasons why laws lag technical innovations.
    This means that technical innovators need to make sure their inventions comply
    with existing laws, or they will need to invest in lobby activities to try to
    change them.

    most relevant to the crypto space are the Bank Secrecy and Money Laundering Control
    acts. The **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** of 1970 requires financial institutions—including
    banks, credit card companies, life insurers, money service businesses and broker-dealers—to
    report cash transactions over $10,000 to the US Department of the Treasury. Financial
    intuitions must also identify the individual making the transaction (‘know your
    customer’) as well as the source of the cash. The **Money Laundering Control Act
    of 1986** makes it illegal to pass money from one person to another with the intent
    to disguise the source, ownership, location or control of the money. Think about
    a Bitcoin transaction. Nakamoto’s whole intent was to bypass financial institutions,
    so how do these laws apply? In general, cryptocurrency exchanges fall under the
    laws, which is why they now require customers to submit legal forms of identification
    to comply with ‘know your customer’ and why they submit reports to the US government.
    If the Bitcoin miners are ever considered to be financial institutions, that would
    seriously jeopardize the future of crypto since there is no way for a Bitcoin
    miner to know the individual’s submitting transactions.'

    operating in the state. A further controversy happened when the chief architect

    In the non-digital world, consumer tokens are commonly used at arcades, theme
    parks, and other entertainment venues. One token, such as a metal coin or printed
    ticket, always has the same consumptive value, such as one token allows the holder
    to play one game, to ride one ride, or to redeem one drink. The Wyoming law allows
    for digital utility tokens. As an example of a digital utility token, consumers
    might buy tokens to raise money for a startup that could later be redeemed to

    state law. The point of the UCC is to allow a business to operate legally in many
    states under the same rule of law. The UCC adopted Wyoming’s proposal, which will
    be debated and considered for UCC adoption sometime after 2023.

    to a third year—giving the legislators time to pass sound regulations around these
    new markets.

- en: One of Wyoming’s most innovative laws created an entirely new type of financial
    institution, called a ***Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI).*** The
    law passed in 2019\. A SPDI is a fully-reserved, Wyoming State chartered fiat
    bank that can also custody crypto assets.^([100](#fn_100)) A SPDI bank is not
    allowed to have fractional reserves, meaning that the customers’ deposits must
    remain at the SPDI bank. Given this stipulation, SPDIs are not required to obtain
    insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—though they may
    do so. SPDI banks can take custody (but not ownership) of digital assets. SPDI
    banks charge fees for services, such as keeping the digital assets safe and executing
    and settling transactions, but they are not allowed to offer loans.^([101](#fn_101))
    The crypto exchange Kraken was the first chartered SPDI bank, called Kraken Bank,
    granted in 2020.^([102](#fn_102)) Custodia Bank, founded by Caitlin Long, was
    the second chartered SPDI bank, also in 2020.^([103](#fn_103)) Kraken Bank and
    Custodia Bank applied to obtain a master account from the US Federal Reserve,
    which provides a bank routing number needed for transactions. Additionally, a
    master account would allow SPDI banks to interact with the Federal Reserve rather
    than depend on other banks. Customarily, a Fed master account requires FDIC insurance,
    but SPDI banks do not need insurance since they keep 100 percent of deposits in
    reserve. The Fed was slow to decide on the requests. Both SPDI banks were awaiting
    the Fed’s responses in 2021\. In December of 2021, Wyoming’s Senator, Cynthia
    Lummis, accused the Federal Reserve of illegally delaying master bank applications.^([104](#fn_104))

    (DAOs) to incorporate. Recall from [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml) that a DAO is
    an organization with investors, but without managers or employees. The investors
    govern the organization with governance tokens, allowing them to vote on decisions,
    thus serving the same functions as a Board of Directors. The question the Wyoming
    law addressed is: how can a DAO incorporate to become a legally recognized company?
    Normally, a startup needs to provide articles of registration and a list of company
    officers to incorporate. But DAOs do not have officers, so how can they incorporate?
    The 2021 Wyoming law allows DAOs to register as companies without listing officers!'

    responsible for rulemaking and for making sure that citizens and businesses comply
    with the rules.^([105](#fn_105)) US Professor Carol Goforth, author of *Regulation
    of Cryptotransactions*, writes, *“The ability of administrative agencies to fill
    in legislative gaps through the process of* *informal rulemaking has been heralded
    as one of the great innovations in modern law. . . There are estimates that more
    than ninety percent of modern American laws are rules adopted by agencies rather
    than statutes imposed by legislators.”*^([106](#fn_106)) When regulations are
    confusing or silent on new ways to transact, innovation adoption slows. Deloitte’s
    2021 survey of 1,280 senior executives in ten countries reported that sixty percent
    of respondents identified regulatory barriers as the biggest obstacle to the use
    of digital assets.^([107](#fn_107))'

- en: In the US Federal government, there are over 100 regulatory agencies. Given
    that financial services are one of the most heavily regulated industries, it’s
    apt to focus upon it. A complex web of federal and state regulators oversees financial
    services in the United States (see [Figure 4.14](#f_4_14)). The agencies that
    are most relevant to our context of crypto and blockchains include the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity
    Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The IRS views crypto as property; the SEC views
    most crypto as securities; and the CFTC views crypto as commodities. Yes, it is
    confusing. The US regulatory framework for crypto is often described as a ‘patchwork’
    of guidance.^([108](#fn_108))

- en: At the Federal level, the US Treasury Department was one of the first regulators
    to enact a cryptocurrency policy. In 2013, it classified Bitcoin as a convertible,
    decentralized, virtual currency, and therefore subject to property taxes. Subsequently,
    the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats cryptocurrencies as property for Federal
    income tax purposes. People must report gains or losses on their US tax returns.^([109](#fn_109))

- en: The ***Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)*** was established to protect
    investors who buy stocks and bonds. Federal laws require companies that plan to
    raise money by selling their own securities to file reports about their operations
    with the SEC, so that investors have access to all material information. The commission
    has powers to prevent or punish fraud in the sale of securities and is authorized
    to regulate stock exchanges. The SEC views many digital token sales as investment
    contracts, and thus subject to SEC regulations. It’s useful to understand how
    the SEC guides its rulings. The SEC applies the ‘***Howey Test***’ to determine
    whether an investment is considered a security and thus subject to SEC regulations.
    The ‘Howey Test’ comes from a 1946 Supreme Court case where the SEC sued the Howey
    Company of Florida. The Howey Company was a citrus farm that leased land to raise
    investment funds but it did not register transactions with the SEC. The Supreme
    Court deemed that the transactions were indeed securities based on a four-part
    test. A transaction is considered a security investment if (1) it includes an
    investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profit
    (4) based solely on the efforts of a promoter or third party. Based on this test,
    mostly all new investments in cryptocurrencies are now viewed as securities.^([110](#fn_110))
    However, the SEC deemed that Bitcoin is NOT a security; by the time the SEC examined
    Bitcoin, the governance was so decentralized that the SEC could not find an identifiable
    promoter or third party.^([111](#fn_111))

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taking the entire blockchain landscape into consideration, how mature is the
    blockchain market as we enter 2022? To answer this question, we’ll look at Gartner’s
    assessment of where blockchains are placed on its well-known hype cycle. Gartner’s
    technology hype cycle comprises five phases that map the level of expectations
    about the innovation over time (see [Figure 4.16](#f_4_16)). During the **technology
    trigger phase**, early proof-of-concepts capture media attention and interest,
    but there are no real applications. During the **peak of inflated expectations
    phase**, a few early successes garner even more attention. Senior executives start
    to take notice, new entrants jump into the market, and the technology may be viewed
    as a silver bullet, i.e., something that promises to instantly solve a long-standing
    problem. Many organizations start testing the technology, but enter the **trough
    of disillusionment phase** when instant success is not achieved. Organizations
    regroup. They learn to apply sound project management, change management, and
    what we call ‘action principles’ to deliver successful applications. In other
    words, it’s hard work to get value from a new innovation. As time passes, upgraded
    versions of the technology are released, the market producers consolidate, and
    organizational consumers learn how to gain value from the innovations. Gartner
    calls this the **slope of enlightenment phase**. The last phase, called the **plateau
    of productivity phase**, sees market maturity, widespread adoption, and integration
    into the enterprises’ standard technology portfolios.

    the five phases. In 2015, blockchains were not yet on Gartner’s map. However,
    by July of 2016, Gartner placed blockchains as past the ‘technology trigger phase’
    and was indeed approaching the apex of the ‘peak of inflated expectations phase’.
    A year later in July 2017, Gartner placed blockchains as nearly finished with
    that phase; blockchains were headed for the ‘trough of disillusionment’. A year
    later, the market hadn’t budged. Finally, by September of 2019, Gartner placed
    blockchain technologies as near the bottom of the trough. In 2019, Gartner estimated
    that more than 90 percent of enterprise blockchain platform implementations will
    fail or will need to be replaced. This is due to a fragmented blockchain market
    and unrealistic expectations.^([130](#fn_130))

    blockchain platforms, consensus mechanisms, blockchain wallets, and cryptocurrencies
    on the maturity curve.

    overall global trends, but industries and specific organizations within industries
    adopt technologies at different rates. For example, companies like EY, IBM, Microsoft,
    and Walmart had already reached the slope of enlightenment by 2019\. Second, the
    pace of adoption is not deterministic; individuals and organizations do not just
    sit around and wait for the future, they actively create it.

    sender cannot trace subsequent transactions on the ledger. When the recipient
    spends money out of that address (thus becoming a “sender” address in a subsequent
    transaction), the address gets hidden within a group signature [https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf);
