- en: The chapter presents the concept of Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)
    and discusses what the current and possible applications are in relation to the
    AEC, design and design-linked industries. The chapter first introduces theoretical
    aspects of traditional organisations and then develops the ones behind the creation
    of automated, computer-based ones. Consensus mechanisms and smart-contracts integration
    are also presented in conjunction with diffused systems of DAOs’ regulation. Scenarios
    are presented where DAOs are applied as a coordination tool for competitive and
    collaborative use within the design field. A comparison table of Ethereum-based
    DAOs as well as reflections on the pros and cons of DAOs applications are provided
    to better frame what the current boundaries are of a technology that is also expanding
    its range of utilisation thanks to the interest of town councils and institutions.

    transparent organisations run by automated programming codes and operated by the
    members of the organisation itself. In order to achieve and retain those characteristics,
    DAOs require to be built and supported by an infrastructure allowing automation,
    shared control and validation of decisions and actions, as well as participation.
    A suitable infrastructure for this purpose has been found in the combination of
    two emerging technologies: Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)/Blockchain (BC)
    and Smart Contracts (SC). The first allows, thanks to their distributed nature,
    to share across all participants the power of decision-making as well as ensuring
    that all decisions and actions are transparently recorded; the second instead
    are automated codes that run when certain conditions are met.'

    that can be in theory applied to any sort of organisation, public or private,
    lucrative or no-profit, with their governance model scaling to the level of theoretically
    substitute entities like town councils and even governments.

    the discourse concerning the limits of current governance schemes, which have
    been almost intact for centuries, and the opportunity provided by the Internet
    in terms of connecting people, fostering collaboration and, with the implementation
    of DAOs and BC, creating and ensuring trust via transparent processes, that are
    then supported by automation, distribution and uniqueness of information.

    living system, humankind faced the necessity of creating media for large groups
    of individuals and started basic collaborations for defence, food production and
    supply, commercial purposes; it appeared natural that also some sort of more structured
    arrangement and hierarchy was necessary in order to coordinate and govern people
    activities.

    remained the most diffused, if not the only way for people to live and operate
    together in a coordinated manner. Alongside individuals, a number of central organisations,
    often ruled by few selected people, were created over the centuries to manage
    the more diverse activities: banks for controlling currencies and financial exchanges,
    governments for ruling empires and nations, companies for managing the workforce
    and producing wealth to be somehow redistributed. Through the time, legitimacy
    was then gained in different ways based on the nature and scope of each specific
    form of organisation: via elections and representation for example in the case
    of democratic governments, or via the trust refunding loans in the case of the
    initial forms of banks and insurances.'

    but far away from being perfect, relied chiefly on the relation between two kinds
    of entities, the agents and those who get represented by them, as well as on the
    intrinsic trust between the two parties. Referring to politics, democracy and
    parliaments can be taken as a perfect example of this symbiosis, where a restricted
    number of agents, Members of Parliament, represent those who technically hold
    and enforce the power via voting, citizens.

    of people to connect with and trusting others, which can be related to the concept
    drafted via the well-known Dunbar’s number [[2](#CR2)]. By acknowledging that
    each person can only well remember and trustfully interact with no more than 150
    people, it appears immediately clear how, in a society counting millions of members,
    concentrating the power of decisions via layers where the number of points of
    control is further reduced appears to be like the only feasible solution to maintain
    social order.

    minority helped to streamline and to take fast decisions; however, it also presented
    significant drawbacks when it came to agents taking excessive risks or acting
    for their own interest rather than for the collective’s one.

    can be generically encompassed under the term information technology have seen
    advances that led people to slowly create tools that could represent a new way
    to organise societies. Starting from the past, one could refer, for example, to
    the invention of the press and the movable type, which created the concept of
    an expanded distribution of knowledge and data with potentially no limits in terms
    of numbers of reachable people and amount of sharable data.

    planet and grant access to information and services to everyone dramatically shifted
    this concept covering all aspects of our daily life. With the spread of internet
    connections and the World Wide Web all over the world, and the combination of
    even more recent and powerful tools such as blockchain and smart contracts, the
    possibility of shifting the paradigm from a people-based trust (and overcoming
    the limitations of the Dunbar number) to technology-based trust became real and
    opened up to the opportunity of moving again towards a more decentralised way
    of living, where control is no longer kept within the boundaries of few people
    and institutions.

    governments in different parts of the world are now looking into the implementation
    of DAOs and crypto technologies in their operations, creating new kind of incentives
    as well as providing platforms to support the more variegated initiatives. To
    some extent, those initiatives may recall the attempts taking place during the
    70 s to create decentralised governance systems in the east of Europe, which clashed

    a DAO contains some kind of internal property that is valuable in some way, and
    it has the ability to use that property as a mechanism for rewarding certain activities
    […]” [[4](#CR4)], a question arises about what impact can have the concept of
    DAOs within the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry and
    what can be intended as internal property in that sector.

    a transformation due to the impact of blockchain technology [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)],
    this cannot be directly and immediately applied also to a field such as AEC, that
    is well-known for being reluctant to changes and slow in implementing innovation,
    with architects and designers mostly presenting themselves as the sole authors
    of concepts and designs [[7](#CR7)]. As a result, a few theoretical and practical
    projects can be found exploring the potential of combining DAOs into AEC daily
    operations, with examples related to this field which also come from stakeholders
    apparently not directly connected with the building industry.

    by envisioning them in both competition and cooperation scenarios, simulating
    designers who collaborate or compete to create new shape grammars assessed via
    a voting system deployed into the DAO. The voting system encompassed both qualitative
    and quantitative aspects, keeping into consideration the experience and knowledge
    of the participants [[7](#CR7), [8](#CR8)]. Further development of this approach
    has been later applied against more objective criteria such as building regulations
    and environmental analysis: application of generative design and shape grammar
    has been tested as a proof-of-concept for a system, where competitors produce
    solutions that are then shared on the DAO via IPFS system [[9](#CR9)].'

    management, finance, operation and maintenance. Being one of a kind attempts of
    connecting DAO’ s-based governance system with the physical world via IoT devices,
    it opens up to future scenarios where buildings are self-owned, the concept of
    rent shifts towards self-maintenance only costs and, more notably, the entire
    set of operations from collecting funds to spend for necessary maintenance is
    controlled via predefined scripts running on the blockchain.

    somehow close to the design and architecture industry but still not yet developed
    in a way in which impact can be recognised in the real-world practice but possibly
    drafting what the future will be. Examples of DAOs such as the platform Decentraland
    tries to combine elements of well-known gaming environments such as Minecraft
    and SecondLife with the proper aspects of a DAO in terms of tokens and decentralised
    government. Land can be bought and sold, as well as virtual goods, artists and
    content creators can be contracted to further personalise the owned plot or house,
    decisions can be taken, and policies updated via the decentralised governance
    interface but still under the umbrella of control of a so-called Security Advisory
    Board [[12](#CR12)]. The example of Decentraland, which makes deep use of a gamified
    environment also to attract users, addresses questions like the proof of ownership,
    which can be applied to many aspects of both real and virtual life, but that can
    be connected to the AEC industry in terms of ownership of lands.

    available due to lacks in cadastral practices) and the standard verbal agreements

    Primavera De Filippi [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]. The project is based on a series
    of art pieces that exist both physically as well as digitally as a blockchain-based
    form of life. Each planetoid, physically represented by a mechatronic kind of
    sun-flower, embeds the concepts of autonomy, self-sustainability and ability of
    self-reproduction thanks to smart contracts deployed in the Ethereum blockchain
    and interactions with humans which feed them via bitcoin donations. Donations
    are later used to hire and fund artists to produce new art pieces that will ensure
    the reproduction process. Besides being an experiment that challenges people’s
    understanding of what life is and what the extents of human–machine interactions
    on a DAO are, the research project tackles the limitations of copyright laws in
    the time of digital design and blockchain, providing at the same time new grounds
    for expanding the concepts of contractual relationships between people and companies

    The task of maintaining the network operative and active is rewarded by an incentive-based
    system that has its roots in the network tokens native to the DAO itself. Protocols
    and tokens are deployed and run on the blockchain, smart contracts act as a further
    layer of automated cooperation between the involved agents, leveraging coding
    and automation to regulate the life of the DAO and to align the interest of the
    participants via consensus mechanisms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consensus mechanisms are the real core behind any blockchain application, with
    DAOs not being an exception. Its role, as per its definition, is to regulate the
    way in which decisions are taken amongst the participants of the DAO, or more
    in general, how to agree on a certain record of a computation activity [[18](#CR18)].
    Different applications can have different ways to reach consensus, such as change
    of state (i.e. Ethereum) or continuous update of the list of transactions (i.e.
    Bitcoin). However, once the mechanism is defined, a question still remains about
    how to accept computers, hence users, to participate to the consensus process.
    Previously, solutions were found in what can be considered a more traditional
    and permissioned approach, where closed infrastructures such as an intranet were
    applied. Thus, losing or yet not taking advantage of the full potential of such
    kind of technology.

    potentially applicable to any kind of business and able to coordinate and to be

    (as well as other operations) off-chain [[19](#CR19)]. While this can appear as
    a betrayal of one of the main concepts behind BC technology, transparency, it
    has to be noted how keeping all the computations in the layer 1 blockchain may
    become too heavy and slow down at the same time single operations and general
    growth of the organisation. Storage, consensus and computation can be pushed out
    from the BC with evident pros and cons in terms of time, cost and data integrity.
    Off-chain data storage brings positive aspects like privacy of the data, when
    necessary, and alleviating the BC from the burden of redundant storage requirements
    [[20](#CR20)]. On the other end, data availability is no longer ensured hence
    potentially interrupting the operations if data are not reachable, as well as
    their integrity can only be assessed when they are available.

    can be described: the approach developed within Bitcoin, where miners are requested
    to reach consensus and later add blocks into the public chain (which can be seen
    as a non-fully decentralised approach to authority and consensus), and applications
    where the consensus is sought and reached off-chain with the aim of reducing the
    operational costs for the participants. In the latter case requests from participants
    are emitted as signals to off-chain miners that perform the computational tasks

    driver feeding the existence of the DAO is the incentives provided in the form
    of net-work tokens, regulated by the transparency of the rules represented by
    the source code of the software running the DAO itself. Agreements are not made
    between a single or group of participants; the protocol or specific smart contracts

    are no longer structured in a top-down scheme with the CEO on the top, a body

    one, where contributors are ideally all on the same level and steer towards agreed
    goals via the selection processes supported by the consensus mechanism. By operating
    in this way, DAOs can be joined and open to people from different areas of the

    that will be voted by the participants and approved if they reach the majority
    of the consensus. As said, the actors may not share any physical space nor know
    each other, hence DAOs can be seen as a distributed entity with autonomous rules

    of the institution itself, allowing the possibility of limitless and theoretically
    timeless expansion to new members and proposals. The current standard workflow
    of a DAO sees users submitting proposals that are voted and, if approved, they
    go to the next stage of getting funded via tokens or to the next step of the life
    of the proposal. Embedding SC in the process, hence removing almost completely
    any arbitrary aspect of human interaction, appears an even most secure way to

    of voting since it has been implemented as one of the basic tools of the democracy
    since this concept exists. As in real-life democratic processes the defined threshold
    has to be carefully assessed in order to ensure that the final decision actually
    reflects the will of the majority of the community [[22](#CR22)]. In the case
    of DAOs a low quorum may lead to an easy-to-pass system and, as a consequence,
    an easy-to-attach DAO. On the other hand, high quorums may lead to very few proposals
    to advance, hence the need for incentives as well as to allow more time for the

    into the voting system. It allows people to predict which proposal will pass in
    a similar manner in which brokers can predict which stock option will increase
    or decrease the value in the stock exchange market. If the prediction is correct,
    predictors gain a financial reward and the involved proposals are then no longer
    assessed via a quorum voting but via a simpler relative majority. The whole system
    is based on the possibility and will of predictors to stake vote on this or that
    proposal, hence by staking funds on them. Since the HC is based on funds it automatically
    cut off, all of those who are not really interested in the proposal or, in a worse
    scenario, those who aim at tampering with the system by misleading the vote.

    systems, nevertheless it is never used as a single and autonomous way of voting.
    Its simplified nature where even one single vote is enough to take a decision
    would expose the organization to high risks of getting attacked if other members
    of the DAO are not looking into the voting process. To overcome this situation,
    DAOs also implemented a sponsor-based approach that acts as an anti-chamber of
    the real vote. Proposals need to be first sponsored by members of the DAO before
    going into the voting stage. This voting system is pretty simple to be implemented
    and does not require many activities from the members.

    of being based on an A versus B approach and that the voting takes place in a
    definite time with a definite result, A wins over B or vice versa. Conviction
    voting instead brings two more components into the voting system: the time and
    the possibility of diversifying one support. Rather than asking members of the
    DAO to decide between two options, they are allowed to stack their voting power
    on one or more proposals and their preference can change over time, so that proposals
    can accumulate or lose support. The more one proposal is supported the more its
    weight grows as well as its chances to get finally approved. The CV simulates
    somehow bio-inspired processes [[23](#CR23)] of growth and decay, and with this
    approach aims to prevent large stakeholders from suppressing minority voters.'

    if no one objects to them. In case of objections, further steps may take place,
    such as a reputation-based vote, in order to decide how to proceed.

    and stakeholders from users with intents that go against the community. However,
    drawbacks are still recognisable in a system that relies on codes written by humans,
    hence perfect in running the operations they have been written for but possibly
    wrong in their overall scope due to lack in coding knowledge or more deliberate
    ability to write codes for purposes which are beyond the common good.

    distributed across the entire DAOs and its participants means inherently that
    no one is accountable for the DAOs decisions. Furthermore, the immutability of
    BC, which represents its most great quality, also represents a limit when it comes
    to the time of updates and bug fixing, which are the norm when dealing with information
    technology-based tools. A possible way to balance between the above aspects that
    characterise the current state of the art among DAOs could be by relying on them
    only for handling certain decisions and operations which do not require a full
    blind trust in a code, or more in general, for DAOs where the sole governance
    and interface for decision making is a public permissionless blockchain.
