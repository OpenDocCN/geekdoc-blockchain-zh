- en: The chapter presents the concept of Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)
    and discusses what the current and possible applications are in relation to the
    AEC, design and design-linked industries. The chapter first introduces theoretical
    aspects of traditional organisations and then develops the ones behind the creation
    of automated, computer-based ones. Consensus mechanisms and smart-contracts integration
    are also presented in conjunction with diffused systems of DAOs’ regulation. Scenarios
    are presented where DAOs are applied as a coordination tool for competitive and
    collaborative use within the design field. A comparison table of Ethereum-based
    DAOs as well as reflections on the pros and cons of DAOs applications are provided
    to better frame what the current boundaries are of a technology that is also expanding
    its range of utilisation thanks to the interest of town councils and institutions.

  zh: 1 简介
- en: 'Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) can be described as completely
    transparent organisations run by automated programming codes and operated by the
    members of the organisation itself. In order to achieve and retain those characteristics,
    DAOs require to be built and supported by an infrastructure allowing automation,
    shared control and validation of decisions and actions, as well as participation.
    A suitable infrastructure for this purpose has been found in the combination of
    two emerging technologies: Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)/Blockchain (BC)
    and Smart Contracts (SC). The first allows, thanks to their distributed nature,
    to share across all participants the power of decision-making as well as ensuring
    that all decisions and actions are transparently recorded; the second instead
    are automated codes that run when certain conditions are met.'

  zh: 去中心化自治组织（DAO）可以被描述为完全透明的组织，由自动化编程代码运行，并由组织成员自己操作。为了实现并保持这些特征，DAO需要建立并受到支持的基础设施，允许自动化、共享控制和对决策和行动的验证，以及参与。为此目的找到了适合的基础设施，即两种新兴技术的组合：分布式账本技术（DLT）/区块链（BC）和智能合约（SC）。第一种技术允许依靠其分布式本质，共享所有参与者决策权，并确保所有决策和行动都被透明记录；第二种则是当满足某些条件时运行的自动化代码。
- en: Beyond the narrow technical description, DAOs represent a form of governance
    that can be in theory applied to any sort of organisation, public or private,
    lucrative or no-profit, with their governance model scaling to the level of theoretically
    substitute entities like town councils and even governments.

  zh: 超越狭义的技术描述，DAO在理论上代表了一种治理形式，可以应用于任何形式的组织，无论是公共的还是私人的、盈利的还是非盈利的，其治理模式可扩展到理论上可以替代城镇议会甚至政府这样的实体。
- en: The recent rise of DAOs and their development finds [[1](#CR1)] its roots in
    the discourse concerning the limits of current governance schemes, which have
    been almost intact for centuries, and the opportunity provided by the Internet
    in terms of connecting people, fostering collaboration and, with the implementation
    of DAOs and BC, creating and ensuring trust via transparent processes, that are
    then supported by automation, distribution and uniqueness of information.

- en: With the introduction of agriculture and the shift towards a more organised
    living system, humankind faced the necessity of creating media for large groups
    of individuals and started basic collaborations for defence, food production and
    supply, commercial purposes; it appeared natural that also some sort of more structured
    arrangement and hierarchy was necessary in order to coordinate and govern people

- en: 'As a result, pyramidal structures with robust top-down approaches became and
    remained the most diffused, if not the only way for people to live and operate
    together in a coordinated manner. Alongside individuals, a number of central organisations,
    often ruled by few selected people, were created over the centuries to manage
    the more diverse activities: banks for controlling currencies and financial exchanges,
    governments for ruling empires and nations, companies for managing the workforce
    and producing wealth to be somehow redistributed. Through the time, legitimacy
    was then gained in different ways based on the nature and scope of each specific
    form of organisation: via elections and representation for example in the case
    of democratic governments, or via the trust refunding loans in the case of the
    initial forms of banks and insurances.'

- en: This approach, which has been tested through centuries demonstrating to be effective
    but far away from being perfect, relied chiefly on the relation between two kinds
    of entities, the agents and those who get represented by them, as well as on the
    intrinsic trust between the two parties. Referring to politics, democracy and
    parliaments can be taken as a perfect example of this symbiosis, where a restricted
    number of agents, Members of Parliament, represent those who technically hold
    and enforce the power via voting, citizens.

- en: Furthermore, what was described above found further support in the limited possibility
    of people to connect with and trusting others, which can be related to the concept
    drafted via the well-known Dunbar’s number [[2](#CR2)]. By acknowledging that
    each person can only well remember and trustfully interact with no more than 150
    people, it appears immediately clear how, in a society counting millions of members,
    concentrating the power of decisions via layers where the number of points of
    control is further reduced appears to be like the only feasible solution to maintain
    social order.

  zh: 此外，上述描述进一步得到了人们和其他人联系和信任的有限可能性的支持，这可以与通过著名的邓巴数所起草的概念联系起来[[2](#CR2)]。通过承认每个人只能记住并信任与之互动不超过
    150 人，立即就能清楚地看出，在一个有数百万成员的社会中，通过将决策权集中在层级中，进一步降低控制点的数量，似乎是维持社会秩序唯一可行的解决方案。
- en: In this scenario, the transfer of power from a majority of people to a selected
    minority helped to streamline and to take fast decisions; however, it also presented
    significant drawbacks when it came to agents taking excessive risks or acting
    for their own interest rather than for the collective’s one.

- en: While the above scheme remained unchanged for centuries, other fields which
    can be generically encompassed under the term information technology have seen
    advances that led people to slowly create tools that could represent a new way
    to organise societies. Starting from the past, one could refer, for example, to
    the invention of the press and the movable type, which created the concept of
    an expanded distribution of knowledge and data with potentially no limits in terms
    of numbers of reachable people and amount of sharable data.

- en: The introduction of the Internet and its capacity to reach each corner of the
    planet and grant access to information and services to everyone dramatically shifted
    this concept covering all aspects of our daily life. With the spread of internet
    connections and the World Wide Web all over the world, and the combination of
    even more recent and powerful tools such as blockchain and smart contracts, the
    possibility of shifting the paradigm from a people-based trust (and overcoming
    the limitations of the Dunbar number) to technology-based trust became real and
    opened up to the opportunity of moving again towards a more decentralised way
    of living, where control is no longer kept within the boundaries of few people
    and institutions.

- en: While this can occur as an idealistic or utopian view of coordinating a large
    number of people's life and activities, it is also interesting to note how city
    governments in different parts of the world are now looking into the implementation
    of DAOs and crypto technologies in their operations, creating new kind of incentives
    as well as providing platforms to support the more variegated initiatives. To
    some extent, those initiatives may recall the attempts taking place during the
    70 s to create decentralised governance systems in the east of Europe, which clashed
    against the highly centralised government of the Soviet apparatus [[3](#CR3)].

    a DAO contains some kind of internal property that is valuable in some way, and
    it has the ability to use that property as a mechanism for rewarding certain activities
    […]” [[4](#CR4)], a question arises about what impact can have the concept of

    a transformation due to the impact of blockchain technology [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)],

    is well-known for being reluctant to changes and slow in implementing innovation,
    with architects and designers mostly presenting themselves as the sole authors
    of concepts and designs [[7](#CR7)]. As a result, a few theoretical and practical
    projects can be found exploring the potential of combining DAOs into AEC daily

    has been later applied against more objective criteria such as building regulations
