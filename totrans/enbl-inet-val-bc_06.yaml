    temperature; sensors for everything imaginable. The data from these sensors became
    extremely helpful in tracking, measuring, controlling and monitoring remotely.
    This capability led to the introduction of many new business models and innovation
    in existing business models. Some of the prominent IoT-based business models include
    (Chaabane [2017](#CR2)): *   **Product-as-a-service:** the customer does not buy
    the product, but rents/leases it from either the manufacturer or a third party.
    The responsibility of maintaining the equipment lies with the equipment owner
    (i.e. the manufacturer or the mediator). IoT played a prominent role in this model,
    as the remote monitoring of equipment became simpler, and acceptance of this model
    increased. The healthcare industry is a big adopter of this model (see Chapter
    “Blockchains, DLTs and the Future of Payments”), as healthcare equipment is expensive
    and requires proactive maintenance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Performance-as-a-product:** the ownership of equipment is necessary or desired,
    but the performance of the machine can still be outsourced with this model. For
    example, the cost of maintenance of jet engines in aircraft can be extremely expensive
    and might have a significant impact on the business. In this event, the business
    owner would like the experts (manufacturers) to be responsible for the performance
    of the machine. Most jet engine manufacturers offer some sort of care package
    for which they guarantee the performance of the engine by remotely managing and
    monitoring it and performing maintenance. The IoT has also enabled a variety of
    new methods for doing business and has found a good niche in the sharing economy
    with the following applications:'

- en: '**Revenue Sharing:** through new services provided to end-customers. One such
    example is bag tracking services provided by airlines. A passenger’s bag will
    be tagged with a sensor provided by an airline partner, and this service can be
    purchased for an additional fee. The revenue generated is shared between the airline
    and the tag provider.'

    the usage of a commodity. In this model, a third party can monitor and regulate
    the usage with the help of IoT sensors and help save on costs of usage. The savings
    are shared between the business/individual and the service provider.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost all business models that depend on IoT have significant inefficiencies,
    leading to a higher costs to the consumer/end-user. The primary reason for these
    inadequacies is the presence of a human intermediary. Although the intermediaries
    are an overhead, they are necessary to ensure privacy, integrity and trust in
    the transactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The presence of intermediaries leads to the unwillingness of the consumer to
    share sensitive data (e.g. personal health data). Although IoT sensors can collect
    a wide variety of data, the availability of that data to unlock its full potential
    is very limited. Even though current IoT business models are successful, there
    is significant value yet to be unlocked.

    The technology can bring trust in a system, encouraging people to share sensitive
    information, as well as enabling two machines to work together and fully trust
    the data, as it is written on a tamper-proof ledger. This can enable unhindered
    transactions across the ecosystem without ever being mediated by a third party,
    resulting in various new business models.

- en: In this chapter, we discuss the importance of trusted information entering into
    blockchain systems provided by oracles. Whether these are human inputted manual
    signals, or automatic machine updates from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, updating
    records is at the heart of any blockchain-based system. Smart contracts that depend
    on external data rely on these devices to function correctly. For these blockchain
    systems to be trusted, the source of any information entering must be accurate
    and reliable. If smart contracts automatically execute based on questionable externally
    inputted data, this can have severe monetary and, possibly, legal issues. In the
    context of the Internet of Value (IoV), if blockchain is empowering this, then
    the veracity of the information on the IoV will only be as good as the quality
    of oracles present.

    on what oracles are and why they are vital to any functioning blockchain ecosystem.
    Next, we look at how oracles are used in blockchain applications in the real estate
    and insurance industries, focusing on how oracles could help provide more resilience,
    trust and efficiency to legal contracts. Finally, we end this chapter with a discussion
    on Oracles and security.

    COVID-19 pandemic when the UK government updated legislation to restrict residential
    property purchasing activities. The UK Law Society guidance (The Law Society [2021](#CR60))
    temporarily adjusted the liabilities and penalties related to property purchases
    (The Law Society [2020](#CR59)). Within this legislation, an important event was
    when the government would lift restrictions. In light of this, real estate contracts
    were revised with clauses referring to these restrictions and what should occur
    within a period of 30 days after restrictions were lifted.
  prefs: []

- en: Real estate legal agreements could have been written to use an oracle to monitor
    the official date that restrictions were eased in a particular region or tier
    of infection. Additional changes made to standard house purchase contracts following
    the initial period of uncertainty were a relaxation of a number of the penalties
    for parties unable to meet their obligations due to the pandemic. Where previously
    there was a penalty for breach by either party, many of these would not apply
    whilst the pandemic was a factor in the breach. This makes the standard house
    agreement far more complex to automate due to the number of permutations added
    by the pandemic and the degree to which the pandemic could be considered a factor.

    interruption (BI) insurance. There are also many instances where these contracts
    are not clear and comprehensive under pandemic situations. Adopting local and
    regional restrictions that adapt based on local infection rates and risk factors
    means that contracts need to be adaptive to their environment. To be effective,
    these contracts need to have a trusted source of data, an agreed data schema and
    a legal lexicon that can add clarity to legal agreements. Combining these elements

    with sufficient levels of reliability and trust. This provides a business opportunity
    to have a network of independent data providers. These providers should be capable
    of supplying reliable and impartial sources of data with sufficient levels of
    traceability and transparency to ensure the integrity of the data.

- en: The GSMA produced a report outlining several use cases for DLT in IoT (GSMA
    [2018](#CR29)). Whilst there are many uses for the capture, storage and security
    of IoT data, one of the key areas of opportunity is unlocking the value of the
    data captured. Oraclised data sources can be as diverse as information feeds coming
    from web pages, sporting, political and news events and financial data. They are
    also increasingly including data from IoT devices capturing climate-related data
    and increasingly imagery from satellite or low earth orbit, or even drone-captured
    imagery. As an example of unlocking this value, the imagery data gathered from
    these types of IoT devices can be used for DLT-enabled carbon credit trading (Mandaroux
    et al. [2021](#CR39)) as a verified source of data around tree plantations and
    other carbon offset projects. The use of IoT and DLT in the area of climate change
    has been explored in more depth in Climate-KIC ([2018](#CR18)), Mandaroux et al.
    ([2021](#CR39)) and Andoni et al. ([2019](#CR6)).

    range of domains that can benefit from efficient contract automation. The overall
    cost and efficiency savings can be passed on by contracting parties to the data
    providers, ensuring the legal agreement’s integrity and leading to new business
    opportunities.

    the volume and velocity of IoT data on-chain (GSMA [2018](#CR29)). Approaches
    taken by Hedera Hashgraph^([30](#Fn30)) and network approaches specifically designed
    for these types of use cases such as IOTA^([31](#Fn31)) may provide some options
    for addressing these performance considerations.

- en: The architectures evolving for processing IoT data include those with a distributed
    approach. Data processing is moving closer to the source of the data due to the
    decreasing computational cost on devices and the increasing power of edge-side
    computing (Agbo et al. [2019](#CR2); Giang et al. [2015](#CR27)). The roll-out
    of 5G technologies and low power networks such as NB IoT,^([32](#Fn32)) LTE-M^([33](#Fn33))
    and LoRaWAN^([34](#Fn34)) means that IoT devices can typically support high bandwidth
    or massive numbers of connected devices to send large amounts of captured data
    for central processing. The capabilities of Mobile Edge Computing^([35](#Fn35))
    allow for complex processing at the point of capture and pre-processing or aggregation
    before sending to a central server or cloud services.

    models, such as image classifiers, provides new opportunities for a data and model
    economy. DLT-enabled IoT and gateway devices that gather data and share proof
    of capture into a oraclised immutable data store, when combined with trusted data
    verifiers, can enable executable contracts that execute within multiple layers
    of the network architecture.

    or a smart camera^([36](#Fn36)) can execute Computer Vision or Machine Learning
    image processing algorithms. These algorithms could identify objects and then
    transmit these objects’ count instead of needing an entire video feed to be sent
    for analysis. A practical example of this could be to measure footfall, which
    Hoxton Analytics^([37](#Fn37)) has created to provide proof of customers arriving
    in a shop or retail environment. This could be useful in a real estate/retail
    contract when charges are based on footfall, occupancy levels or other factors
    that a smart camera could determine.

    and exchanging both raw and processed data and ML models. This data and these
    models could be purchased to augment data analysis. Ocean provides a new type
    of marketplace for verified data sources, where one use case could be for contract
    processing in insurance claim verification and automated triggering. Captured
    data could also be traded and used as a basis for DLT-enabled online dispute resolution
    using platforms such as Jur.^([39](#Fn39))

- en: Security in a DLT network and the smart contracts that execute within it is
    dependent on the underlying network and smart contract code auditing. A major
    weak point of the system may be the external data provider’s accuracy and reliability,
    as the smart contract logic will automatically operate based on its data. Multiple
    sources of data should be available to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness
    of any data used. If a bad actor with a financial or other interest provides incorrect
    data, having multiple providers and an appropriate strategy for resolving differences
    in received values is necessary. Strategies may include voting, potentially with
    a weighting towards more reliable providers, and a round-robin approach, where
    the values from multiple oracles will be used over time (at the risk of a malicious
    or inaccurate oracle being used occasionally). A reputation score for oracle sources
    may help ensure trust in the validity of these sources and, if available, could
    be used to weigh the votes.

    use cases include how data used in pricing models could create new value streams
    and enable some disruption to an industry that has gained from a lack of transparency
    and barriers to data. Already, aspects of this can be seen in action with various
    new platforms and solutions in the market.

    and how IoT could facilitate more efficient insurance provision. Given ongoing
    uncertainty, and the likelihood of future pandemics and related events, many smart
    contracts applications will require oraclised data sources. Examples of this include,
    parametric pandemic insurance linked to business interruption schemes or rental
    and lease agreements. The approach elucidated earlier on utilising Oracles and
    IoT has application in the construction sector and tracking climate-related events
    such as storms and significant events such as floods and earthquakes. Benefits
    in cost savings from automation and increased accuracy of processing payment calculations
    and a shared audit trail of contract parameters, inputs and claims obligations
    can lower overall administrative cost from manually managing policies and thereby
    increase certainty.
