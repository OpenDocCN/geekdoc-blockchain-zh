- en: I promised myself I wouldn’t write another book. Worse, I promised my wife,
    Jean, that I wouldn’t write another book! It’s a long, challenging exercise. The
    content must be complete and correct—and that means spending more time researching
    than actually writing. Then there’s the matter of sorting the information that’s
    been compiled into a coherent structure. The whole thing is like a chess match
    where it’s always your move. Make a mistake, and the results are disastrous.

  zh: 我答应自己不会再写一本书。更糟糕的是，我答应了我的妻子琼，我不会再写一本书！这是一项漫长而艰巨的工作。内容必须完整正确——这意味着要花更多的时间进行研究，而不是真正的写作。然后，还要将已编制的信息整理成一个连贯的结构。整个过程就像是一场永远轮到你走棋的棋局。犯了一个错误，结果就会灾难性。
- en: Having written 10 books, I promised I wouldn’t write another. But this topic
    is so new, so different, so laden with acute potential to profoundly improve the
    lives of every American, that I found the need and opportunity too compelling
    to ignore.

  zh: 写了10本书之后，我答应不再写书了。但是这个主题是如此新颖、如此不同，如此充满了深刻改变每个美国人生活的潜力，以至于我觉得有必要和机会太过强大，无法忽视。
- en: Luckily, I have enjoyed the help and support of several people, and they deserve
    a lot of credit. We’ll start with my longtime agent, Gail Ross, who shepherded
    the project with my publisher. And many thanks to the Simon & Schuster team, especially
    executive editor Stephanie Frerich and associate editor Emily Simonson. Other
    members of the S&S team include production editor Morgan Hart, who masterfully
    proofread the manuscript and caught literally thousands of typos and other errors;
    design director Paul Dippolito, who created the page layout; and Beth Maglione,
    who organized the printing of this book.

  zh: 幸运的是，我得到了几个人的帮助和支持，他们应该得到很多赞扬。我们先从我的长期代理人盖尔·罗斯开始，她与我的出版商一起引导了这个项目。非常感谢西蒙与舒斯特团队，特别是执行编辑斯蒂芬妮·弗里里奇和副编辑艾米丽·西蒙森。西蒙与舒斯特团队的其他成员包括制作编辑摩根·哈特，她精心校对了手稿，找出了成千上万的错别字和其他错误；设计总监保罗·迪波利托，他设计了页面布局；以及贝丝·马格利奥内，她组织了这本书的印刷。
- en: 'Assembling the many lists of products, services, and companies that appear
    throughout the book are due to the tireless work of members of the DACFP team:
    Rene Chaze, Don Friedman, Janice Murphy, and Max Torres. In addition to that huge
    accomplishment, they joined colleagues Maribeth Bluyus, Anna Dawson, Liz Dougherty,
    Rick Fowler, Hank Hanna, and Monay James in providing me valuable comments on
    the manuscript.'

  zh: 本书中出现的许多产品、服务和公司列表的编制归功于DACFP团队成员的不懈工作：雷内·查泽、唐·弗里德曼、简尼斯·墨菲和马克斯·托雷斯。除了这个巨大的成就之外，他们与同事玛丽贝丝·布鲁伊斯、安娜·道森、丽兹·道尔蒂、瑞克·福勒、汉克·汉纳和莫纳·詹姆斯一起，在手稿上提供了有价值的评论。
- en: Speaking of, I especially want to thank financial planners Scott Butera, Loran
    Coffman, Pat Day, Alan Facey, Doug Keegan, Felix Kwan, Andrew Massaro, Mark Palmer,
    and Bob Sargent. They are rare among financial advisors, as they are highly knowledgeable
    about digital assets—which is why I asked them to read the initial draft of my
    manuscript. Their comments and suggestions led me to make massive changes in the
    book, and I thank them for their insightful and invaluable contributions.

    research from their study “The Case for Crypto in an Institutional Portfolio.”
    My readers and I are indebted to the study’s authors, Bitwise’s David Lawant and
    Matt Hougan.

    cartoon suggestions for my books. Paul turns reading into a participant sport,
    and I thank him for helping me liven up the otherwise dull subject of money.

    In addition to providing a great many comments on the manuscript, she designed
    and created all the charts and graphics you see throughout the book. Michaele
    worked long hours until tight deadlines, and her work is masterful. Thank you,
    Michaele.

- en: Most importantly, I want to express my deepest thanks to my darling wife. Writing
    is a mentally intensive activity that requires isolation for long, sustained periods.
    Jean readily encouraged me to embark on this project, because she knows how important
    it is, and she willingly allowed me the solitude all writers require, breaking
    it only a few times a day to put food on top of my keyboard. Jean can teach saints
    about patience, and the rest of us so much more. Thank you, Jean, for your love
    and support, as strong today as, and more important to me than, *ever.*
