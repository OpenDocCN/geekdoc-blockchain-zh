- en: I promised myself I wouldn’t write another book. Worse, I promised my wife,
    Jean, that I wouldn’t write another book! It’s a long, challenging exercise. The
    content must be complete and correct—and that means spending more time researching
    than actually writing. Then there’s the matter of sorting the information that’s
    been compiled into a coherent structure. The whole thing is like a chess match
    where it’s always your move. Make a mistake, and the results are disastrous.

- en: Having written 10 books, I promised I wouldn’t write another. But this topic
    is so new, so different, so laden with acute potential to profoundly improve the
    lives of every American, that I found the need and opportunity too compelling
    to ignore.

    a lot of credit. We’ll start with my longtime agent, Gail Ross, who shepherded
    the project with my publisher. And many thanks to the Simon & Schuster team, especially
    executive editor Stephanie Frerich and associate editor Emily Simonson. Other
    members of the S&S team include production editor Morgan Hart, who masterfully
    proofread the manuscript and caught literally thousands of typos and other errors;
    design director Paul Dippolito, who created the page layout; and Beth Maglione,
    who organized the printing of this book.

    throughout the book are due to the tireless work of members of the DACFP team:
    Rene Chaze, Don Friedman, Janice Murphy, and Max Torres. In addition to that huge
    accomplishment, they joined colleagues Maribeth Bluyus, Anna Dawson, Liz Dougherty,
    Rick Fowler, Hank Hanna, and Monay James in providing me valuable comments on
    the manuscript.'

- en: Speaking of, I especially want to thank financial planners Scott Butera, Loran
    Coffman, Pat Day, Alan Facey, Doug Keegan, Felix Kwan, Andrew Massaro, Mark Palmer,
    and Bob Sargent. They are rare among financial advisors, as they are highly knowledgeable
    about digital assets—which is why I asked them to read the initial draft of my
    manuscript. Their comments and suggestions led me to make massive changes in the
    book, and I thank them for their insightful and invaluable contributions.

    research from their study “The Case for Crypto in an Institutional Portfolio.”
    My readers and I are indebted to the study’s authors, Bitwise’s David Lawant and
    Matt Hougan.

    cartoon suggestions for my books. Paul turns reading into a participant sport,
    and I thank him for helping me liven up the otherwise dull subject of money.

    In addition to providing a great many comments on the manuscript, she designed
    and created all the charts and graphics you see throughout the book. Michaele
    worked long hours until tight deadlines, and her work is masterful. Thank you,
    Michaele.

    is a mentally intensive activity that requires isolation for long, sustained periods.
    Jean readily encouraged me to embark on this project, because she knows how important
    it is, and she willingly allowed me the solitude all writers require, breaking
    it only a few times a day to put food on top of my keyboard. Jean can teach saints
    about patience, and the rest of us so much more. Thank you, Jean, for your love
    and support, as strong today as, and more important to me than, *ever.*
