    bookshelves cluttered with photos of Martin posing with various tech CEOs. It
    was that amazing fish tank, which looked like it was airlifted out of SeaWorld.

    the coral reefs teeming with angelfish. I was simultaneously captivated by Martin’s
    fish and by the reflection of Martin’s frizzy hair. It was a high-humidity day.

    fish guy.” He punctuated each word with a jab of his finger. “The fish guy does
    all the work. I just enjoy it.”

    the guy they’d bring in to turn around troubled companies. Then he “retired” into
    a second career as an entrepreneurial adviser and early-stage investor. In the
    Boston startup scene, all roads ran through Martin.

    He was dressed in the traditional tech investor uniform—Patagonia vest and jeans—but
    that frizz! I guess his hair was his trademark: mildly eccentric millionaire.
