- en: The thing I remember most about Martin’s home office was the fish tank.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn’t the rich mahogany desk, the bowl of imported Chinese candies, the
    bookshelves cluttered with photos of Martin posing with various tech CEOs. It
    was that amazing fish tank, which looked like it was airlifted out of SeaWorld.

- en: “Martin, you’d give the New England Aquarium a run for its money,” I said, admiring
    the coral reefs teeming with angelfish. I was simultaneously captivated by Martin’s
    fish and by the reflection of Martin’s frizzy hair. It was a high-humidity day.
  prefs: []

- en: He chuckled. “The only secret to owning an aquarium like this is to have a good
    fish guy.” He punctuated each word with a jab of his finger. “The fish guy does
    all the work. I just enjoy it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course Martin had a fish guy. His first career was as a successful tech executive,
    the guy they’d bring in to turn around troubled companies. Then he “retired” into
    a second career as an entrepreneurial adviser and early-stage investor. In the
    Boston startup scene, all roads ran through Martin.

    He was dressed in the traditional tech investor uniform—Patagonia vest and jeans—but
    that frizz! I guess his hair was his trademark: mildly eccentric millionaire.
    Good branding.'

    our company, Media Shower, is wrapping up the year with 25 percent growth over
    last year.”
  prefs: []

- en: “Well, that’s also the bad news.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    Jade and I work our asses off. Sixty-hour weeks. Five years? Ten years? I’ve lost
    track.”

    do we want to grow?”
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    stick.”

    mind hack.”

    out doing comedy, right?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I’m sorry it wasn’t Harvard,” I said. “But I did go back for my MBA.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So from comedy to MBA, and now you’ve built this little Internet agency.” The
    word “little” was a Brillo pad on an open ego. “How many clients now?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Our agency,” I bristled, “has over a hundred clients. A dozen full-time employees.
    A hundred freelancers.”

    want a unicorn.”
  prefs: []

    fairy tale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it in his mouth.
  prefs: []

    many times.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Only we call it ‘evolution.’ ”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Martin raised his eyebrows and tilted his head as if thinking, Point taken.
    “There’s nothing wrong with this path you’re on. But if you really want to take
    it to the next level, you’ve got to evolve faster. How many Internet agencies
    are there?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I don’t know. Infinity.” I threw up my hands. “It’s cutthroat.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s because all agencies are the same. You’re all selling salt. Might come
    in a fancier box, but it’s still salt.” These words stung, but this was why I
    was paying him.

    his hair in a kind of frizzy halo.

    is zagging.”

    promise.”

    passion.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    and you reduce it to drug money? It is so much more than that.” I opened my Moleskine

    which we build websites like Google. But how does the Internet actually work?
    I’ve been working on the Internet my entire life, and I still think it’s powered
    by hamsters.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You don’t need to know how an engine works to drive a car.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Right.” I pointed at him. “Now think of blockchain as a platform, like the
    Internet. It’s the underlying technology behind bitcoin, and I think it’s going
    to be huge.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s over $100, Martin! There are people who bought bitcoin when it was a dollar.
    Imagine buying $10,000 worth of bitcoin a couple of years ago. That would be worth
    $10 million today!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “One million,” Martin corrected me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My face turned red. “Point is,” I stammered, “there’s something here. We picked
    up a huge new banking client and they’re having us write a whole series about
    blockchain.” I told him the name of the banking client.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “This is a big opportunity, Martin. I am ready to go big or go home.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    home.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on you, my adviser?”
  prefs: []

    good.
