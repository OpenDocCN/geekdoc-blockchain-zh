- en: The emergence of the new intelligent information world is increasing the responsibilities
    of the telecommunication industry to meet the unprecedented service-level needs
    for future applications like virtual reality (VR), 3D media, Internet of Everything
    (IoE), massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC). To match this envisaged demand
    surge of service level and massive traffic volume, ultra-high data rates with
    reliable connectivity are required. 5G is deployed and used widely in many parts
    of the world. The application of automated systems with millions of sensors and
    chips embedded in them is popular in the healthcare industry, roads, space, oceans,
    homes, vehicles, and other environments to offer a smart and automated life. 6G
    wireless networks can show improvements over 5G with the increase in speed, reliability,
    and bandwidth availability. Also, it will enhance the quality of service (QoS)
    in key domain areas like healthcare, entertainment, smart cities, etc. 6G is expected
    to fulfill the crucial requirements for the high-end users and industry with a
    vision to focus upon key factors such as security and privacy. Blockchain is envisioned
    to address the security challenges in 6G and facilitate the functional standards.

- en: The explosive growth in mobile traffic with the use of applications like [[1](#CR1)–[4](#CR4)]
    is expected to be 607 Exabytes/month by 2025\. Also, the next generation is expected
    to be software-based, virtualized, and cloud-based systems connecting a large
    number of heterogeneous devices. These heterogeneous devices, for instance, IoT/IoE
    and other real-time data-intensive applications need to function at higher data
    rates with ultra-low latency. 5G networks will not be capable enough to fulfill
    the future emerging demands of the fully automated data-centric and intelligent
    network after 10 years [[5](#CR5)]. 6G networks are envisioned to cater to this
    anticipated massive increase in data traffic. The software-based, virtualized,
    and cloud-based next-generation mobile networks offer many advantages in the future
    like agile and efficient management, micro-operator-based business models [[6](#CR6)],
    and network orchestration (MANO) [[7](#CR7)]. But these also exacerbate many challenges
    like security issues, soft-spectrum sharing, privacy, multiple access control,
    legitimate resource utilization, and many more. However, to establish trust in
    future networks blockchain a distributed ledger technology in general has been
    embraced widely by industry and many organizations [[8](#CR8)–[10](#CR10)]. The
    paramount number of advantages offered by indispensable blockchain technology
    such as decentralization, immutability, fewer processing delays, non-repudiation
    of the transaction, and transparency have proved it to be suitable for 6G wireless
    networks. The growing demand for bandwidth-intensive services and the use of high
    data-rate applications have forced the telecommunication industry the evolution
    of 6G. The next-generation 6G systems are designed by considering the requirements
    of higher data rates by the applications, gigantic antenna models [[4](#CR4)],
    blockchain integration for security, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning
    techniques, etc. Sixth-generation systems are expected to meet the demands of
    highly connected complex intelligent networks. Also, it will address the performance
    requirements of the innovative services dependent on increasing resources [[11](#CR11),
    [12](#CR12)]. The framework design process of 6G networks needs innovative approaches
    to change the systems from closed hierarchical patterns towards distributed networks.
    The networks design also needs to have self-organization and optimization capability
    for interaction between nodes (Table [1](#Tab1)).Table 1

    and low backhaul. Building upon the 5G vision, the 6G discussion is gradually
    taking momentum to empower a plethora of autonomous services for IoT devices,

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with different inner features, which can dynamically interact with each other
    unpredictably and randomly without any prior planning. The interactive elements
    of the network include individuals, their interests and behavior, wearable or
    handheld devices, etc., which form heterogeneous nodes forming a complex socio-technical
    ecosystem. The nodes of multiplex social networks consist of heterogeneous smart
    devices, mobiles, devices, etc. The entities of IoT subnetworks along with other
    smart devices are also represented as nodes of a multiplex social network. The
    multiplex dimension provides a suitable representation for the structural analysis
    of complex systems. Also, the 6G networks can be studied as a collection of multidimensional
    subnetworks comprising elements interacting in different ways. The transition
    from a closed network structure to an open distributed system or dynamic topology
    including vast heterogeneity necessitates the node-level intelligence. A node
    in a network is responsible for content diffusion, learning, and computation.
    Thus, a node profiling process in complex networks serves the above purpose [[13](#CR13)].
    The complex network’s approach for node profiling integrates the phenomenon of
    using dynamics of diffusion, application of evolutionary game theory approach,
    applying models of epidemic spreading, hierarchical organization of the network
    into mesoscopic structures called communities.

    structural properties of the elements of the network and their interdependence
    as compared to the single graph representation in form of nodes and links connecting
    them [[14](#CR14), [14](#CR14)]. The multidimensional network structure can retain
    the important knowledge of structural complexity and connectivity, which may be
    lost in single graph representation. The important details and phenomena of real-world
    networks may be lost or missed by studying the network as a single layer only.
    Multilayer networks are the study of network structures at different layers of
    connectivity [[16](#CR16)]. In this type of network, nodes have different layers
    of connectivity, which is a generalization of graph theory in networks. Complex
    connectivity of the networks is clearly described in multilayer networks as various
    channels of interaction are embedded in different layers. Multilayer networks
    also known as multiplex networks constitute many real-world networks like social
    networks, brain networks, biological networks, technological networks, social
    contagions [[17](#CR17)], etc. The multiplex nature of social networks adds dimension
    to the study. The complexity of connections can be analyzed deeply by characterizing
    interactions based on cost, weight, and intensity in different layers [[18](#CR18)].

    patterns or hidden organization of the nodes [[20](#CR20)]. The nodes of the network

    networks lead us to explore emerging phenomena like epidemic dynamics, super-diffusion,
    and cascading failures, etc. The diffusion dynamics are analogous to the spreading
    process of diseases [[26](#CR26)], emotions, and misinformation. It can also be
    modeled as social contagion [[21](#CR21)] in networks. The effect of diffusion
    processes evolving in the network is also an interesting part to be explored.
    The impact of content exposure and changes in dynamics of social behavior affect
    the diffusion process [[27](#CR27), [28](#CR28)]. The evolutionary dynamics of
    competition are analyzed using Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) concept. EGT is
    an extension of the traditional Game Theory. Its applications can be seen in the
    study of genetics theory to find the frequency of a gene's appearance [[29](#CR29)].
    The study includes dynamism in strategies and the changes in the behavior of individuals
    interacting with each other in games. These theories of dynamism in strategies
    and gaming behavior of individuals help to predict the nature of real-world networks
    using mathematical models.

    Game (SD), etc. These social dilemmas are useful for studying the dynamics of

    interacting with them. A multiplex social network S[m] is shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2)
    with different levels of interconnections among different layers representing
    a 6G subnetwork. A node indicates any basic units such as IoT devices, mobiles,
    laptops, gadgets or wearables, etc. The framework of the multiplex network is
    a population of N number of nodes and L number of layers as L1, L2, L3…L[s]. Here,
    suppose s = 2 layers, which indicate L[1] as a real network layer [[31](#CR31)]

    To understand the complex interdependence of the networks, the multiplex social
    network provides a platform [[32](#CR32)]. In this step, we consider the key features
    of evolving spreading processes. These key features are extracted from the analysis
    of quantifying estimators of two interdependent and co-evolving processes analogous
    to disease-spreading processes [[21](#CR21)]. These spreading processes are thought
    of as “Composed-SIR” models. Composed-SIR models are derived from the classical
    SIR epidemic models [[33](#CR33)]. Two interdependent spreading processes are
    referred to as the epidemic process of diffusion of awareness [[21](#CR21), [21](#CR21)].
    For each node, awareness and heterogeneity are included. For describing the influence
    of the diffusion process and competition, heterogeneity and awareness are used
    for all nodes to favor the evolutionary dynamics. Each node represents the knowledge
    it has collected as awareness aw. This awareness is different for all nodes. The
    knowledge is acquired by the node from interest or participation in a collective
    phenomenon. Consequently, all the nodes will collectively join the diffusion process
    because the acquired awareness has an impact on the behavior of the node's functionality.

    from the vision for intelligent wireless networks for 2030, service requirements,
    the role of blockchain technology in enhanced security, intriguing challenges,
    and canvassed the role of node profiling in complex networks. The complex approach
    for 6G wireless networks with other tools and methods attempts to enable complex
    systems to be self-organized and cognitive networks. The introduction of the profiling
    approach in 6G networks helps nodes to achieve cognition ability to implement
    a fully intelligence-based distributed user-centric system. 6G in communication
    networks will change the future of the telecommunications network making them
    more resilient and self-organized. Complex networks reflect the collective behavior
    of the elements connected. The multiplex social network is studied in a mathematical
    form enabling different types of communication. The collective dynamic of diffusion
    is also studied which helps the communities in the network by increasing the cognitive
    capability of the nodes. Complex networks are fully described by the structural
    organization and connectivity of their elements. Complex networks describe the
    way their elements interact with each other collectively with their inner features.
    The future perspective of communication networks is expected to be changed by
    the involvement of 6G. Thus, complex systems with the incorporation of new methods
    and tools can design cognitive networks. These self-organized and resilient complex
    systems can serve many application domains like smart city networks and digital
    health care. Multiple types of interactions in a network can be studied through
    the complex profiling of heterogeneous nodes. The dynamics of diffusion are possible
    through social contagion and the approach of evolutionary game theory.
