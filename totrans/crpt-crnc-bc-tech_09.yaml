- en: In this final chapter, we present an overview of the key lessons that have been
    provided throughout this collection. The substantial surge in interest and continued
    media coverage surrounding cryptocurrencies, and in particular, Bitcoin, has generated
    an environment through which pricing bubbles, market manipulation and illicit
    usage could thrive. There have been many accusations of substantial inherent issues
    such as the generation of significant environmental effects and the potential
    shutdown of the internet and broad technology as we know it due to the sheer size
    of cryptocurrency ledgers. Further, legal and regulatory issues, including the
    lack of international consistency as to what exactly cryptocurrency represents
    as a financial product continue to obstruct the trust of many investors. The many
    cases of market manipulation and illegality that exist have also substantially
    diminished trust. However, after a decade in existence, the price of Bitcoin remains
    consistently elevated, acts as quite a useful diversification tool, and does present
    uses as a tool to covert international value, even if it is one of the most volatile
    alternative investments in existence.

  zh: 在最后一章中，我们概述了本系列中提供的关键教训的概览。围绕加密货币，特别是比特币，兴趣的显著增长和持续的媒体报道创造了一个环境，在这个环境中，定价泡沫、市场操纵和非法使用得以繁荣。有许多指控称，加密货币账本规模巨大，导致了显著的环境影响，以及互联网和我们所知的大规模技术潜在的关闭。此外，法律和监管问题，包括关于加密货币作为金融产品缺乏国际一致性，继续阻碍了许多投资者的信任。市场上存在的许多操纵和非法行为也大大削弱了信任。然而，在比特币存在十年的时间里，其价格始终保持高位，作为一种非常有用的多元化工具，也确实作为国际价值的转换工具，即使它是存在中最波动的替代投资之一。

    upmost importance that we continue to expand our understanding of this youthful
    financial product, with particular emphasis on the contagion effects that can
    be sourced therein. The regulatory issues surrounding the growth and usage of
    cryptocurrencies has also been the focus of substantial attention in recent time.
    These chapters provided a broad cross-discipline perspective. We first analysed
    a range of questions such as what exactly is blockchain, or what best describes
    the Bitcoin mining process? We focused specifically on the provision of explanation
    outlining the role of cryptocurrencies and blockchains on real economic transactions,
    investigating as to how blockchain affects information friction and asymmetry
    in economic and financial transactions and further, as to how it changes the landscape
    of markets while considering spillover effects upon all market participants.

  zh: 尽管加密货币作为一种产品继续以步伐扩张，但我们继续扩大对这种年轻的金融产品的理解仍然至关重要，尤其是其中可以产生的传染效应。近年来，围绕加密货币的增长和使用的监管问题也受到了大量关注。这些章节提供了一个跨学科的广泛视角。我们首先分析了一系列问题，如区块链究竟是什么，或者什么最能描述比特币挖矿过程？我们专注于提供解释，概述加密货币和区块链在实际经济交易中的角色，调查区块链如何影响经济和金融交易中的信息摩擦和不对称，以及它如何在考虑对所有市场参与者的溢出效应的同时改变市场格局。
- en: Further, we investigated the literature on both broad- and narrow-based cryptocurrency
    research from a bibliometric and scientometric perspective. Such analysis is used
    to establish the development of a visual representation and explanation of the
    flow of research direction during the past decade based on blockchain and cryptocurrency
    across all disciplines. We provide clear evidence of a growing but fragmented
    research area, while concluding that there is a significant difference in how
    researchers treat broad conceptual topics versus individual products. We finally
    provided a concise overview of the current topics that have been central to recent
    research efforts, while attempting to provide oversight key areas that have presented
    evidence of particular deficiency. Regardless as to whether one believes that
    cryptocurrencies to be a passing fad, the future of money or somewhere in between,
    they have emerged as one of the most interesting and discussed financial assets
    of the last decade, with particular evidence that these assets have had greatly
    increased research activity focused on them over the last two years. This research
    however is characterised by being rather fragmented. It is fragmented in a significant
    sense across products and broad areas. The authors state that “while islands of
    research do connect they do so in very limited ways”. This research is found to
    be parallel, mostly non-overlapping research initiatives drawing inspiration form
    the technical and the economic literature but limited “interdisciplinary” research.
    It is within this section of the research that this handbook goes some way to
    providing an overview of the areas of research and will spark greater cooperation
    to develop broad alignment. Such recommendations will hopefully provide direction
    for future research synergy.

- en: Next, we investigated the financial characteristics of cryptocurrencies, identifying
    that they are best characterised by heavy tail behaviour, very high volatility,
    persistence, large and abrupt price swings, and vulnerability to speculative bubbles,
    among other properties, all of which lead cryptocurrencies to resemble more financial
    assets rather than fiat currencies. Moreover, cryptocurrency markets exhibit some
    informational inefficiencies, which, however, depend on several factors. Finally,
    cryptocurrencies are highly connected to each other but isolated from mainstream
    assets, with their hedging and safe haven properties varying over time. This research
    is further supported through two further piece of works, the first providing a
    test of the interactions between cryptocurrency and various US stock indices using
    Granger causality analysis; and the second specifically analysing the market microstructure
    of cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, there is evidence of a relationship between
    Bitcoin and US tech stock indices. Specifically, there is clear evidence of predictability
    between Bitcoin and US tech stocks, which seems to vary across quantiles. US stocks
    Granger cause Bitcoin return, but this is not the case for other stock indices.
    Generally, Granger causality from one market to another is insignificant in both
    mean and variance. However, when one market is in its bear state, the other become
    more volatile. Furthermore, there is evidence of casualties when one market is
    in its bear market state, while the other is in its bear or bull market state.
    With regards to market microstructure, while analysing a broad range of specific
    questions, one of the key takeaways is based on the fact that there continues
    to be no central authority to register cryptocurrency exchanges, it is estimated
    that there are currently up to five hundred exchanges in circulation, characterised
    by varying platforms, geographical reach, and compliance with regulatory frameworks.
    Cryptocurrency markets share many similar characteristics with both foreign exchange
    and equity markets such as limit order books and matching algorithms, and exchanges
    that can be both centralised or decentralised. As these markets are still in their
    infancy, what shape or form they will take in future will depend on a combination
    of acceptance from consumers, the investment community, as well as worldwide regulators.

  zh: 接下来，我们研究了加密货币的财务特征，发现它们最适合用重尾分布、极高波动性、持续性、大范围和剧烈的价格波动以及易受投机泡沫影响等特性来描述，所有这些特性都使加密货币更类似于金融资产，而不是法定货币。此外，加密货币市场表现出一些信息效率低下，但这取决于多个因素。最后，加密货币之间联系紧密，但与主流资产隔离，其对冲和避险属性随时间变化。这项研究还得到了两篇进一步作品的支持，第一篇通过Granger因果分析提供了加密货币与各种美国股票指数之间相互作用的测试；第二篇专门分析了加密货币的市场微观结构。不出所料，有证据表明比特币与美国科技股票指数之间存在关系。具体来说，比特币与美国科技股之间存在明显的可预测性，且似乎在分位数上有所不同。美国股票导致比特币回报的Granger因果关系，但其他股票指数并非如此。通常，从一个市场到另一个市场的Granger因果关系在均值和方差上都不显著。然而，当一个市场处于熊市状态时，另一个市场变得更加波动。此外，当一个市场处于熊市状态时，而另一个市场处于熊市或牛市状态，都会造成损失。关于市场微观结构，在分析一系列具体问题时，一个关键的启示是基于这样一个事实：至今仍没有一个中央机构来注册加密货币交易所，据估计，目前流通中的加密货币交易所多达五百个，它们的特点是平台不同、地域范围各异、遵守的监管框架不同。加密货币市场与外汇市场和股票市场有许多相似之处，如限价订单簿和配对算法，交易所可以是中心化的或去中心化的。由于这些市场仍处于起步阶段，未来它们将采取何种形状或形式将取决于消费者、投资社区以及全球监管机构的接受程度。
- en: The next chapter sets out to establish the key issues that have become central
    within the market for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Within this context, we provide
    a brief overview of the existing literature based on ICOs around the world, while
    explaining the motivations and styles of criminality that have occurred, the methods
    that have been widely used by cryptocurrency thieves, the potential for the innovation
    of theft within the sector and the related problems that such technological progress
    can potentially generate, and the types of market agents that have set out to
    potentially misuse ICOs for a variety of reasons at both the sovereign and corporate
    level. As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, it is imperative that policy-makers
    and regulators continue to monitor the potential development of sophisticated
    manipulation and cybercriminality techniques that have developed throughout the
    market for cryptocurrencies. A central theme throughout these listed issues and
    examples surrounds substantial damage to credibility within the market. We have
    observed cases of theft at the level of the exchange, within the whitepapers that
    have been provided, through the usage of celebrities to support marketing tactics,
    through the illegal cross-jurisdictional transfer of funds and indeed, the most
    simplest form of theft, where the ICO counter-party quite simply disappears with
    the accumulated assets of investors. While cryptocurrency-enthusiasts continue
    to promote the positive attributes that support the potential growth of this new
    investment asset, the same proponents cannot ignore that this entire sector has
    been rampant with levels and styles of fraudulent behaviour that is quite difficult
    to find in other international markets of similar scale and scope. But there have
    been significant positive developments in terms of the future scope of international
    regulation and the potential to eliminate fraudulent behaviour. It is essential
    that during the continued growth of the sector for cryptocurrencies that regulation,
    including a broad international set of standards, be developed and maintained
    to grow at pace with the market for cryptocurrencies. It is essential that regulations
    must compare effectively with the sophistication of the market that they attempt
    to monitor. Until the broad gap between regulation and the capacity for cryptocurrency
    market misuse is diminished, there will continue to be substantial and frequent
    loss of investor assets through mechanisms that represent those usually observed
    in an exceptionally juvenile market.

  zh: 下一章节旨在确立在首次币发行（ICOs）市场中变得核心的关键问题。在这一背景下，我们简要概述了围绕全球ICOs现有的文献，同时解释了已经发生的犯罪动机和风格，广泛被加密货币盗贼使用的手段，该领域内盗窃创新的潜力以及此类技术进步可能产生的相关问题，以及那些出于各种原因在主权和公司层面潜在误用ICOs的市场参与者类型。随着加密货币市场的持续发展，政策制定者和监管机构必须继续监控市场上发展起来的复杂操纵和网络犯罪技术。在这些列举的问题和例子中，一个核心主题围绕着市场信誉的重大损害。我们观察到在交易所层面的盗窃，提供的白皮书中的盗窃，利用名人支持营销策略，非法跨国资金转移，以及最简单的盗窃形式，即ICO对手方简单地带着投资者的累积资产消失。尽管加密货币爱好者继续推广支持这一新型投资资产的积极属性，但这些支持者不能忽视整个行业充斥着与其他国际市场规模和范围相似的市场中难以找到的欺诈行为水平和文化风格。但在国际监管未来范围和消除欺诈行为潜力方面已经取得了重大积极进展。在加密货币行业的持续增长中，制定和维护包括广泛国际标准在内的监管至关重要，以跟上加密货币市场的步伐。监管必须有效地与它们试图监测的市场
    sophistication 相比较。直到监管与加密货币市场误用的能力之间的巨大差距缩小，投资者资产将通过代表一个异常幼稚市场中通常观察到的机制而继续遭受重大和频繁的损失。
- en: Finally, this book concluded with an investigation of the environmental aspects
    of cryptocurrency markets and as to how their rapid growth can influence the environment
    and through which channels this process manifests. The authors find focus on the
    area where to date, we possess the most thorough data and evidence through which
    we can build the case, namely electricity consumption associated with the mining
    of cryptocurrencies. The total carbon footprint of the industry is now estimated
    to have surpassed that of many large industrial nations. This chapter investigates
    the multiple knock-on effects and consequential behaviour of this rapid growth
    in energy usage, such as an increase in global temperature, the growth of mining
    companies who have targeted third world infrastructures, and the complete shutdown
    of the Internet as we know it. Saying that, we encourage investors not to ignore
    these environmentalism matters, since we also show that electricity consumption
    is proven to be one of the commonly used variable in valuation of mineable cryptocurrencies
    and identification of their fair value, which affect investments returns and should
    be considered in their trading strategies. Overall, the authors concluded The
    rise in cryptocurrency mining can therefore be seen as environmentally damaging
    in two ways. Firstly, the mining of cryptocurrency requires substantial volumes
    of electricity. Secondly, cryptocurrency mines are distributed in a way that enables
    them to take advantage of cheap electricity in countries that utilise power generation
    from non-renewable resources such as coal, effectively giving the industry a commercial
    preference towards unsustainable energy. Additionally, bitcoin mining falls outside
    conventional environmental regulatory frameworks designed to address traditional
    mining. The total carbon footprint of the industry is now estimated to have surpassed
    that of many large industrial nations. This chapter has investigated the multiple
    knock-on effects and consequential behaviour of this rapid growth in energy usage,
    such as an increase in global temperature, the growth of mining companies who
    have targeted third world infrastructures, and the complete shutdown of the Internet
    as we know it.

  zh: 最后，本书以对加密货币市场的环境方面进行调查而结束，探讨了其快速增长如何影响环境，以及这一过程通过哪些渠道表现出来。作者们专注于一个领域，即到目前为止，我们拥有最全面的数据和证据，可以据此建立论点，那就是与加密货币挖矿相关的电力消耗。该行业的总碳排放量现在估计已经超过了许多大型工业国家。本章调查了这种快速增长能源使用所带来的连锁反应和后续行为，例如全球温度的升高，针对第三世界基础设施的挖矿公司的增长，以及我们所知互联网的彻底关闭。话说回来，我们鼓励投资者不要忽视这些环境问题，因为我们也显示了电力消耗被证明是估值挖矿加密货币和确定其公平价值时常用的一个变量，这影响了投资回报，应该在其交易策略中考虑。总的来说，作者们得出结论，加密货币挖矿的兴起因此在两个方面可以被视为对环境有害。首先，加密货币的挖矿需要大量的电力。其次，加密货币矿山以一种使它们能够利用像煤炭这样的非可再生能源发电的国家的廉价电力的方式分布，实际上使得该行业在不可持续能源方面具有商业优势。此外，比特币挖矿超出了旨在解决传统采矿问题的传统环境监管框架。该行业的总碳排放量现在估计已经超过了许多大型工业国家的碳排放量。本章已经调查了这种快速增长能源使用所带来的连锁反应和后续行为，例如全球温度的升高，针对第三世界基础设施的挖矿公司的增长，以及我们所知互联网的彻底关闭。

    of a new product is developing trust and recognition with a customer base. International
    traders and those who conduct cross-border trade are generally exposed to exchange
    rate risk while being subject to fees associated with exchanging one currency
    for another. Further, there may be challenges in exchanging currency dependent
    on availability in certain jurisdiction. Fortunately, for some large cryptocurrencies,
    this is not a particularly significant issues as the digital currency is universally
    recognised at an exchange-driven value. This minimises valuation risk and somewhat
    saves time in determining a price for a transaction, as well as any fees associated
    with exchanging money from one form to another. As cryptocurrency continues to
    expand and is increasingly adopted around the world, it has the potential to make
    financial transactions faster and simpler.'

    exposed to theft as would be possible in other transactions with other legacy
    payment systems. It is far more difficult to steal cryptocurrency compared to
    a physical wallet. However, there are issues with specific types of criminality
    that must be addressed before to ensure that credibility is maintained. However,
    identity theft and hacking are two specific issues that cryptocurrency users are
    constantly exposed. Credit cards operate on a ‘pull’ basis, where the store initiates
    the payment and pulls the designated amount from your account, necessitating credentials
    at the point of purchase. Cryptocurrency uses a separate ‘push’ mechanism that
    allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant
    or recipient with no further information. However, there is no scope for error
    as misplaced trades cannot be retrieved without a resolution provided from a party
    that might not be able to be identified in a timely manner.'

    cryptocurrency exchanges to charge so-called ‘maker’ and ‘taker’ fees, and other
    fees such as deposit and withdrawal fees, cryptocurrency users are generally not
    subjected to the traditional banking fees associated with fiat currencies, therefore,
    no account maintenance or minimum balance fees, no overdraft charges and no returned
    deposit fees, among many others. While standard wire transfers and foreign purchases
    typically involve fees and exchange costs, since cryptocurrency transactions have
    no intermediary institutions or government involvement, the costs of transacting
    are kept very low. This can be a major advantage for travellers. Additionally,
    any transfer generally occurs rapidly, therefore, eliminating the inconvenience
    of typical authorisation requirements and waiting periods usually experienced
    in the banking system. These services act like PayPal (who does not accept cryptocurrency)
    does when considering cash or credit card users, thereby providing the online
    exchange system. Cryptocurrency act as a direct threat to similar payment mechanisms.'

    with the increased speed of such technological development, these same populations
    can use this new payment mechanism in a meaningful way. It is very possible that
    such product development mirrors the expansion of mobile phone technology in the
    latter period of the 1990s, where the new product spread rapidly through the developing
    world, and saturated markets where standard landline telephones had never been
    established. It is not unrealistic to assume that cryptocurrency can do similar.
    Because users are able to send and receive cryptocurrency with only a smartphone
    or computer, cryptocurrency is theoretically available to populations of users
    without access to traditional banking systems, credit cards and other methods

    today is the issue of scalability. The main concern within this regards is trust
    of the blockchain, that is, if there are only a few entities capable of running
    full nodes, then those entities could potentially collude to present themselves
    with a large number of additional cryptocurrency, and there would be no way for
    other users to audit such behaviour, namely, that a block is invalid without processing
    an entire block themselves. Currently, most of the cryptocurrencies can handle
    10–100 transactions per second. This limitation stops blockchain networks from
    being used by solid companies and real-world business use cases. Obviously, that’s
    a temporary thing that is close to being solved by various solutions, like Lightning
    network, Waves-NG, Graphene, etc. While the number of cryptocurrencies continues
    to increase at pace, the speed of a transaction is another important metric that
    cryptocurrencies cannot compete with on the same level until the infrastructure
    delivering these technologies is massively scaled. Such an evolution is complex
    and difficult to do seamlessly. However, some have already proposed several solutions,
    including lightning networks, sharding, and staking as options to overcome the
    scalability issue. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to create a blockchain
    design that maintains Bitcoin-like security guarantees, but where the maximum
    size of the most powerful node that needs to exist for the network to keep functioning
    is substantially sub-linear in the number of transactions.'

    solid 公司和现实世界的商业用例所使用。显然，这是一个接近解决的问题，可以通过各种解决方案，如闪电网络、Waves-NG、Graphene 等来解决。随着加密货币数量的继续增加，交易的速度是加密货币无法在同等水平上竞争的另一个重要指标，直到提供这些技术的基础设施得到大规模扩展。这种演变是复杂且难以无缝进行的。然而，一些人已经提出了几种解决方案，包括闪电网络、分片和质押作为克服可扩展性问题的选项。为了解决这个问题，有必要创建一个维护比特币类似安全保证的区块链设计，但其中最强大的节点最大尺寸需要存在，以使网络保持运行，且与交易数量相比是显著的亚线性。'

    the current time to high accuracy. All cryptocurrency users have clocks in a normal
    distribution around some ‘real’ time with standard deviation of twenty seconds,
    that is, there are no more than twenty seconds between two nodes on the blockchain.
    The system should continuously provide a time which is within the designated standard
    deviation (or less if possible) of the internal clock of >99% of honestly participating
    nodes. External systems may end up relying on this system; hence, it should remain
    secure against attackers regardless of incentives. For example, Ethereum possesses
    a thirteen second block of time and with no particularly advanced time-stamping
    technology implemented. It uses a simple technique where a client does not accept
    a block whose stated timestamp is earlier than the client’s local time. However,
    to date, this has not been tested under serious attacks. The recent network-adjusted
    timestamps proposal tries to improve on the status quo by allowing the client
    to determine the consensus on the time in the case where the client does not locally
    know the current time to high accuracy; this has not yet been tested. But at this
    point in time, issues surrounding time-stamping are not currently at the foreground
    of the key challenges to cryptocurrencies, however, they do open an avenue through
    which cybercriminality can prevail.'

- en: Overall, cryptocurrencies have a long way to go before they can replace the
    traditional mechanisms through which global finance flows. However, as outlined
    throughout this book, even considering the many, substantial issues that exist
    within this developing sector, there have also been a number of benefits and unexpected
    side-effects generated. To briefly conclude, the regulation of the product and
    the subsequent reduction of cybercriminality appear to immediately necessitate
    action, even before the need for technical improvement. It would appear that the
    reduced usage of cryptocurrency has manifested directly from the substantial theft
    and illicit usage that is central to the product’s usage. Media coverage has been
    based largely on such issues, not necessarily on the implicit benefits contained
    therein. Most individuals, without deep financial knowledge base their views of
    such products on such basic news coverage, which has mainly surrounded the volatility
    of these products and the cybercriminality contained within. Should confidence
    be restored, this could lead to increase usage, allowing cryptocurrencies to potentially
    grow in a more organic manner. It must be noted that the use of such technology
    presents benefits to countries with a lack of basic infrastructure, such as easy
    access to banking networks. However, the very nature of the technology also makes
    it a very useful tool for many forms of illicit behaviour. Governments and regulatory
    bodies in the medium-term will most likely reach a crossroads as to how to balance
    these positive and negative outcomes. While some investors in 2009 did not foresee
    the longevity of digital currencies as a viable financial product, many most certainly
    did not envisage their survival for a decade. Cryptocurrencies have presented
    much resilience, continuing to thrive even considering the many issues that they
    have faced. It is within the forthcoming decade that we will understand as to
    whether cryptocurrencies can grow to be the ground-breaking future of finance
    that proponents claim the product can become.

  zh: 总体而言，加密货币要在取代全球金融流动的传统机制之前还有很长的路要走。然而，正如本书所概述的，即使考虑到这个发展中的领域存在的许多重大问题，也已经有了一定数量的好处和意外的副作用。简要总结，产品的监管和随后的网络犯罪减少似乎立即需要采取行动，甚至在技术改进的需求之前。看来，加密货币使用减少直接源于产品使用中核心的大规模盗窃和非法使用。媒体报道主要基于这些问题，而不是其中隐含的好处。大多数没有深厚金融知识的人，根据这样的基本新闻报道来形成对这些产品的看法，这些报道主要围绕这些产品的波动性和其中的网络犯罪。如果信心得以恢复，这可能导致使用增加，使加密货币有可能以更有机的方式增长。必须注意的是，这种技术的使用为缺乏基本基础设施的国家带来了好处，如轻松访问银行网络。然而，这种技术的本质也使其成为许多形式非法行为的非常有用的工具。在中期内，政府和监管机构很可能达到一个十字路口，关于如何平衡这些积极和消极的结果。虽然2009年的一些投资者没有预见到数字货币作为一种可行金融产品的长期性，但许多人肯定没有预见到它们能生存十年。加密货币表现出了巨大的韧性，即使考虑到它们所面临的所有问题，仍然继续蓬勃发展。在即将到来的十年里，我们将了解加密货币是否能够成长为支持者声称产品可以成为的金融领域的突破性未来。
