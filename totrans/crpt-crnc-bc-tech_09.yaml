    provided throughout this collection. The substantial surge in interest and continued
    media coverage surrounding cryptocurrencies, and in particular, Bitcoin, has generated
    an environment through which pricing bubbles, market manipulation and illicit
    usage could thrive. There have been many accusations of substantial inherent issues
    such as the generation of significant environmental effects and the potential
    shutdown of the internet and broad technology as we know it due to the sheer size
    of cryptocurrency ledgers. Further, legal and regulatory issues, including the
    lack of international consistency as to what exactly cryptocurrency represents
    as a financial product continue to obstruct the trust of many investors. The many
    cases of market manipulation and illegality that exist have also substantially
    diminished trust. However, after a decade in existence, the price of Bitcoin remains
    consistently elevated, acts as quite a useful diversification tool, and does present
    uses as a tool to covert international value, even if it is one of the most volatile
    alternative investments in existence.

    upmost importance that we continue to expand our understanding of this youthful
    financial product, with particular emphasis on the contagion effects that can
    be sourced therein. The regulatory issues surrounding the growth and usage of
    cryptocurrencies has also been the focus of substantial attention in recent time.
    These chapters provided a broad cross-discipline perspective. We first analysed
    a range of questions such as what exactly is blockchain, or what best describes
    the Bitcoin mining process? We focused specifically on the provision of explanation
    outlining the role of cryptocurrencies and blockchains on real economic transactions,
    investigating as to how blockchain affects information friction and asymmetry
    in economic and financial transactions and further, as to how it changes the landscape
    of markets while considering spillover effects upon all market participants.

    research from a bibliometric and scientometric perspective. Such analysis is used
    to establish the development of a visual representation and explanation of the
    flow of research direction during the past decade based on blockchain and cryptocurrency
    across all disciplines. We provide clear evidence of a growing but fragmented
    research area, while concluding that there is a significant difference in how
    researchers treat broad conceptual topics versus individual products. We finally
    provided a concise overview of the current topics that have been central to recent
    research efforts, while attempting to provide oversight key areas that have presented
    evidence of particular deficiency. Regardless as to whether one believes that
    cryptocurrencies to be a passing fad, the future of money or somewhere in between,
    they have emerged as one of the most interesting and discussed financial assets
    of the last decade, with particular evidence that these assets have had greatly
    increased research activity focused on them over the last two years. This research
    however is characterised by being rather fragmented. It is fragmented in a significant
    sense across products and broad areas. The authors state that “while islands of
    research do connect they do so in very limited ways”. This research is found to
    be parallel, mostly non-overlapping research initiatives drawing inspiration form
    the technical and the economic literature but limited “interdisciplinary” research.
    It is within this section of the research that this handbook goes some way to
    providing an overview of the areas of research and will spark greater cooperation
    to develop broad alignment. Such recommendations will hopefully provide direction
    for future research synergy.

    that they are best characterised by heavy tail behaviour, very high volatility,
    persistence, large and abrupt price swings, and vulnerability to speculative bubbles,
    among other properties, all of which lead cryptocurrencies to resemble more financial
    assets rather than fiat currencies. Moreover, cryptocurrency markets exhibit some
    informational inefficiencies, which, however, depend on several factors. Finally,
    cryptocurrencies are highly connected to each other but isolated from mainstream
    assets, with their hedging and safe haven properties varying over time. This research
    is further supported through two further piece of works, the first providing a
    test of the interactions between cryptocurrency and various US stock indices using
    Granger causality analysis; and the second specifically analysing the market microstructure
    of cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, there is evidence of a relationship between
    Bitcoin and US tech stock indices. Specifically, there is clear evidence of predictability
    between Bitcoin and US tech stocks, which seems to vary across quantiles. US stocks
    Granger cause Bitcoin return, but this is not the case for other stock indices.
    Generally, Granger causality from one market to another is insignificant in both
    mean and variance. However, when one market is in its bear state, the other become
    more volatile. Furthermore, there is evidence of casualties when one market is
    in its bear market state, while the other is in its bear or bull market state.
    With regards to market microstructure, while analysing a broad range of specific
    questions, one of the key takeaways is based on the fact that there continues
    to be no central authority to register cryptocurrency exchanges, it is estimated
    that there are currently up to five hundred exchanges in circulation, characterised
    by varying platforms, geographical reach, and compliance with regulatory frameworks.
    Cryptocurrency markets share many similar characteristics with both foreign exchange
    and equity markets such as limit order books and matching algorithms, and exchanges
    that can be both centralised or decentralised. As these markets are still in their
    infancy, what shape or form they will take in future will depend on a combination
    of acceptance from consumers, the investment community, as well as worldwide regulators.

    within the market for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Within this context, we provide
    a brief overview of the existing literature based on ICOs around the world, while
    explaining the motivations and styles of criminality that have occurred, the methods
    that have been widely used by cryptocurrency thieves, the potential for the innovation
    of theft within the sector and the related problems that such technological progress
    can potentially generate, and the types of market agents that have set out to
    potentially misuse ICOs for a variety of reasons at both the sovereign and corporate
    level. As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, it is imperative that policy-makers
    and regulators continue to monitor the potential development of sophisticated
    manipulation and cybercriminality techniques that have developed throughout the
    market for cryptocurrencies. A central theme throughout these listed issues and
    examples surrounds substantial damage to credibility within the market. We have
    observed cases of theft at the level of the exchange, within the whitepapers that
    have been provided, through the usage of celebrities to support marketing tactics,
    through the illegal cross-jurisdictional transfer of funds and indeed, the most
    simplest form of theft, where the ICO counter-party quite simply disappears with
    the accumulated assets of investors. While cryptocurrency-enthusiasts continue
    to promote the positive attributes that support the potential growth of this new
    investment asset, the same proponents cannot ignore that this entire sector has
    been rampant with levels and styles of fraudulent behaviour that is quite difficult
    to find in other international markets of similar scale and scope. But there have
    been significant positive developments in terms of the future scope of international
    regulation and the potential to eliminate fraudulent behaviour. It is essential
    that during the continued growth of the sector for cryptocurrencies that regulation,
    including a broad international set of standards, be developed and maintained
    to grow at pace with the market for cryptocurrencies. It is essential that regulations
    must compare effectively with the sophistication of the market that they attempt
    to monitor. Until the broad gap between regulation and the capacity for cryptocurrency
    market misuse is diminished, there will continue to be substantial and frequent
    loss of investor assets through mechanisms that represent those usually observed
    in an exceptionally juvenile market.

    of cryptocurrency markets and as to how their rapid growth can influence the environment
    and through which channels this process manifests. The authors find focus on the
    area where to date, we possess the most thorough data and evidence through which
    we can build the case, namely electricity consumption associated with the mining
    of cryptocurrencies. The total carbon footprint of the industry is now estimated
    to have surpassed that of many large industrial nations. This chapter investigates
    the multiple knock-on effects and consequential behaviour of this rapid growth
    in energy usage, such as an increase in global temperature, the growth of mining
    companies who have targeted third world infrastructures, and the complete shutdown
    of the Internet as we know it. Saying that, we encourage investors not to ignore
    these environmentalism matters, since we also show that electricity consumption
    is proven to be one of the commonly used variable in valuation of mineable cryptocurrencies
    and identification of their fair value, which affect investments returns and should
    be considered in their trading strategies. Overall, the authors concluded The
    rise in cryptocurrency mining can therefore be seen as environmentally damaging
    in two ways. Firstly, the mining of cryptocurrency requires substantial volumes
    of electricity. Secondly, cryptocurrency mines are distributed in a way that enables
    them to take advantage of cheap electricity in countries that utilise power generation
    from non-renewable resources such as coal, effectively giving the industry a commercial
    preference towards unsustainable energy. Additionally, bitcoin mining falls outside
    conventional environmental regulatory frameworks designed to address traditional
    mining. The total carbon footprint of the industry is now estimated to have surpassed
    that of many large industrial nations. This chapter has investigated the multiple
    knock-on effects and consequential behaviour of this rapid growth in energy usage,
    such as an increase in global temperature, the growth of mining companies who
    have targeted third world infrastructures, and the complete shutdown of the Internet
    as we know it.

    traders and those who conduct cross-border trade are generally exposed to exchange
    rate risk while being subject to fees associated with exchanging one currency
    for another. Further, there may be challenges in exchanging currency dependent
    on availability in certain jurisdiction. Fortunately, for some large cryptocurrencies,
    this is not a particularly significant issues as the digital currency is universally
    recognised at an exchange-driven value. This minimises valuation risk and somewhat
    saves time in determining a price for a transaction, as well as any fees associated
    with exchanging money from one form to another. As cryptocurrency continues to
    expand and is increasingly adopted around the world, it has the potential to make
    financial transactions faster and simpler.'

    payment systems. It is far more difficult to steal cryptocurrency compared to
    a physical wallet. However, there are issues with specific types of criminality
    that must be addressed before to ensure that credibility is maintained. However,
    identity theft and hacking are two specific issues that cryptocurrency users are
    constantly exposed. Credit cards operate on a ‘pull’ basis, where the store initiates
    the payment and pulls the designated amount from your account, necessitating credentials
    at the point of purchase. Cryptocurrency uses a separate ‘push’ mechanism that
    allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant
    or recipient with no further information. However, there is no scope for error
    as misplaced trades cannot be retrieved without a resolution provided from a party
    that might not be able to be identified in a timely manner.'

    cryptocurrency exchanges to charge so-called ‘maker’ and ‘taker’ fees, and other
    fees such as deposit and withdrawal fees, cryptocurrency users are generally not
    subjected to the traditional banking fees associated with fiat currencies, therefore,
    no account maintenance or minimum balance fees, no overdraft charges and no returned
    deposit fees, among many others. While standard wire transfers and foreign purchases
    typically involve fees and exchange costs, since cryptocurrency transactions have
    no intermediary institutions or government involvement, the costs of transacting
    are kept very low. This can be a major advantage for travellers. Additionally,
    any transfer generally occurs rapidly, therefore, eliminating the inconvenience
    of typical authorisation requirements and waiting periods usually experienced
    in the banking system. These services act like PayPal (who does not accept cryptocurrency)
    does when considering cash or credit card users, thereby providing the online
    exchange system. Cryptocurrency act as a direct threat to similar payment mechanisms.'

    with the increased speed of such technological development, these same populations
    can use this new payment mechanism in a meaningful way. It is very possible that
    such product development mirrors the expansion of mobile phone technology in the
    latter period of the 1990s, where the new product spread rapidly through the developing
    world, and saturated markets where standard landline telephones had never been
    established. It is not unrealistic to assume that cryptocurrency can do similar.
    Because users are able to send and receive cryptocurrency with only a smartphone
    or computer, cryptocurrency is theoretically available to populations of users
    without access to traditional banking systems, credit cards and other methods
    of payment.'

    today is the issue of scalability. The main concern within this regards is trust
    of the blockchain, that is, if there are only a few entities capable of running
    full nodes, then those entities could potentially collude to present themselves
    with a large number of additional cryptocurrency, and there would be no way for
    other users to audit such behaviour, namely, that a block is invalid without processing
    an entire block themselves. Currently, most of the cryptocurrencies can handle
    10–100 transactions per second. This limitation stops blockchain networks from
    being used by solid companies and real-world business use cases. Obviously, that’s
    a temporary thing that is close to being solved by various solutions, like Lightning
    network, Waves-NG, Graphene, etc. While the number of cryptocurrencies continues
    to increase at pace, the speed of a transaction is another important metric that
    cryptocurrencies cannot compete with on the same level until the infrastructure
    delivering these technologies is massively scaled. Such an evolution is complex
    and difficult to do seamlessly. However, some have already proposed several solutions,
    including lightning networks, sharding, and staking as options to overcome the
    scalability issue. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to create a blockchain
    design that maintains Bitcoin-like security guarantees, but where the maximum
    size of the most powerful node that needs to exist for the network to keep functioning
    is substantially sub-linear in the number of transactions.'

    distribution around some ‘real’ time with standard deviation of twenty seconds,
    that is, there are no more than twenty seconds between two nodes on the blockchain.
    The system should continuously provide a time which is within the designated standard
    deviation (or less if possible) of the internal clock of >99% of honestly participating
    nodes. External systems may end up relying on this system; hence, it should remain
    secure against attackers regardless of incentives. For example, Ethereum possesses
    a thirteen second block of time and with no particularly advanced time-stamping
    technology implemented. It uses a simple technique where a client does not accept
    a block whose stated timestamp is earlier than the client’s local time. However,
    to date, this has not been tested under serious attacks. The recent network-adjusted
    timestamps proposal tries to improve on the status quo by allowing the client
    to determine the consensus on the time in the case where the client does not locally
    know the current time to high accuracy; this has not yet been tested. But at this
    point in time, issues surrounding time-stamping are not currently at the foreground

    platforms constantly have to improve their security framework in order to stay
    ahead of the hackers and thieves. It is important to remember that as technology
    becomes more sophisticated, so do hackers. Exchanges are essentially so vulnerable
    to hacks because they centralise the risk, so further decentralisation can be
    an option in the pursuit for maximum security. Some of the key cybercriminality
    risks have been identified as:'

    where abusive and illicit manoeuvres can manifest. It is reported that crypto
    exchanges use algorithms to manipulate the prices of coins. In a number of situations,
    cryptocurrency traders exposed a promotion on some exchanges which inflated the
    trading volume on the exchange, where there was a connection between fake trading
    volumes and paybacks as trading fees as an airdrop. Further, when a tradeable
    asset can drop by as much as fifty percent in less than 24 hours, we must ask
    significant questions. There are a number of reasons that contribute to the excessive
    volatility in the market but perhaps the biggest contributor is the activities
    of ‘whales’, who are individuals that have large cryptocurrency holdings. They
    are able to swing the market by manipulating the price of a cryptocurrency. They
    do this by means of buying and selling walls. The problem with this regularly
    occurring scenario is that the whales can drive up the price without actually
    investing in the market. The actual trades that have boosted the price of the
    cryptocurrency has come from the smaller traders. Further, one of biggest reasons
    why this sort of asset price manipulation is possible is due to the lack of position
    price limits/fees on many cryptocurrency trading platforms. If adequate limits
    or fees are put in place, it would discourage the movement of large buy and sell
    market positions.'

    the cryptocurrency market. Many tokens are introduced to the market via ICOs with
    investors buying these tokens in exchange for fiat money. Pump and dump ICO schemes
    continue to be a problem for the market due to the lack of regulation. During
    the ICO, the entrepreneurs behind the token speculate massively on the coin, driving
    the prices up and getting investors attracted. Once this is done, the same investors
    cash out, therefore leaving the investors with worthless coins that have little
    or no value. There has also been a substantial increase in the level of spoofing
    payment information and phishing.'

    files on their computers. Therefore, they can be stolen using malware or lost

    The collection address is posted on the project website when it opens. There have
    been a number of situations where such user addresses have been intercepted and
    the precedes stolen. This has also manifested in the hacking of payment gateways.'

- en: Overall, cryptocurrencies have a long way to go before they can replace the
    traditional mechanisms through which global finance flows. However, as outlined
    throughout this book, even considering the many, substantial issues that exist
    within this developing sector, there have also been a number of benefits and unexpected
    side-effects generated. To briefly conclude, the regulation of the product and
    the subsequent reduction of cybercriminality appear to immediately necessitate
    action, even before the need for technical improvement. It would appear that the
    reduced usage of cryptocurrency has manifested directly from the substantial theft
    and illicit usage that is central to the product’s usage. Media coverage has been
    based largely on such issues, not necessarily on the implicit benefits contained
    therein. Most individuals, without deep financial knowledge base their views of
    such products on such basic news coverage, which has mainly surrounded the volatility
    of these products and the cybercriminality contained within. Should confidence
    be restored, this could lead to increase usage, allowing cryptocurrencies to potentially
    grow in a more organic manner. It must be noted that the use of such technology
    presents benefits to countries with a lack of basic infrastructure, such as easy
    access to banking networks. However, the very nature of the technology also makes
    it a very useful tool for many forms of illicit behaviour. Governments and regulatory
    bodies in the medium-term will most likely reach a crossroads as to how to balance
    these positive and negative outcomes. While some investors in 2009 did not foresee
    the longevity of digital currencies as a viable financial product, many most certainly
    did not envisage their survival for a decade. Cryptocurrencies have presented
    much resilience, continuing to thrive even considering the many issues that they
    have faced. It is within the forthcoming decade that we will understand as to
    whether cryptocurrencies can grow to be the ground-breaking future of finance
    that proponents claim the product can become.
