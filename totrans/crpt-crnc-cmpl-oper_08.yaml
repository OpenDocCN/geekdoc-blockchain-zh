- en: Historically there has been a narrative that the cryptocurrency markets are
    largely unregulated and that therefore, there is no supervision or enforcement
    action that is taken to oversee the crypto markets by financial regulators. While
    the cryptocurrency markets are nowhere near as regulated as the traditional financial
    markets, this does not mean that financial regulators are not involved in enforcing
    existing law and regulations as they are applicable to the crypto markets. Furthermore,
    as with all segments of the financial markets, there are fraudsters who seek to
    execute schemes in order to steal from investors. Financial regulators have also
    increasingly played a role in attempting to hold accountable many alleged fraudsters
    in the crypto space and assist the victims of fraud in attempts to recover stolen
    capital.

- en: A ***Ponzi scheme*** is a classic type of fiat investment fraud whereby someone
    raises money from investors, often based on the promise of unrealistically high
    and risk-free returns, and then uses the money raised from subsequent new investors
    to pay the existing investors. The scheme was named after an individual, Charles
    Ponzi, who in the 1920s defrauded investors through a $20 million postage stamp
    speculation scheme that was one of the largest frauds ever reported at the time.[¹](#FPar1)
    A more recent incarnation of the Ponzi scheme fraud occurred when Bernard Madoff
    stole approximately $65 billion in the largest private Ponzi scheme in history
    through his hedge fund operation Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.[²](#FPar1)

    space. During periods of bullish performance in the crypto markets investors often
    develop a phenomenon known as **Fear of Missing** **Out (FOMO)**. Effectively
    investors experiencing FOMO participate in an investment, such as cryptocurrency,
    that they might not fully understand because the fear of missing out on future
    profits is greater than their lack of knowledge. Furthermore, when FOMO is in
    play investors will often take on more risk than they would traditionally be comfortable
    with or exaggerate the risk related to investments with which they are already
    comfortable with through mechanisms such as options to gain leverage in trading.
  prefs: []

    known as ***Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)*** about the crypto markets. FOMO
    and FUD often interplay to result in retail investors being susceptible to fraud
    in the crypto space through Ponzi schemes and other related frauds. Contributing
    to investor susceptibility to fraud in this area are the technological barriers
    to entry certain groups of retail investors face when seeking to invest in where
    they seek out those that provide access to the crypto markets that are unfortunately
    operating fraudulent crypto hedge funds. Many curious younger investors are also
    exposed to a wide variety of crypto-related content ranging from the basics of
    crypto investing and how to create a digital wallet to technical ***tokenomics***
    analysis from self-styled crypto advisors through social media platforms such
    as TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Telegram, and Discord.[³](#FPar1)
    For reference, tokenomics is a term used to refer to the underlying economics
    of a specific crypto coin or token including supply and demand and new token issuance
    schedules.[⁴](#FPar1) It is also referred to as ***token economics*** or ***crypto-economics***.

    have taken advantage of investors desire to participate in the crypto markets
    by executing a variety of fraudulent schemes. In other cases, regulators have
    stepped in to put a stop to certain activities which have not led to the clear
    conclusion of outright fraud but have often resulted in regulatory action stopping
    certain activity and the alleged bad actors paying settlements. The remainder

    $15,815,967 worth of Bitcoin and U.S. dollars from at least 179 individuals to

    pairs, among other things. During the early stages of his activity, Saffron created
    Circle Society and used this entity to perpetrate his fraud. According to the

    members of the general public to participate in a commodity pool operated by Circle
    Society by making false claims of Saffron’s trading expertise and guaranteeing
    rates of return up to 300%. Rather than using pool participants’ funds to trade
    as promised, the defendants misappropriated funds, including by holding participants’
    funds in Saffron’s personal electronic cryptocurrency wallet and by using funds
    to pay some participants with the funds of other participants, in the manner of
    a Ponzi scheme. The majority of participants, however, have been unable to obtain
    a return of any of their funds despite their repeated demands.

    revenue share. A 30% commission on investor funds that were brought in directly
    by the promoter, and a lower commission percentage that ranged from 5 to 20% on
    funds that the investors he brought in had then solicited into the scheme (i.e.

    of only one month in the United Kingdom.[^(23)](#FPar1)

    UK FCA advise that investors undertake measures to directly check the regulators
    website in order to independently verify whether or not an entity is authorized
    by the regulator. For the UK FCA this information would be contained on the Financial
    Services Register ([https://​register.​fca.​org.​uk/​s/​](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/)).
    The US equivalents would include the US SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure
    website ([https://​adviserinfo.​sec.​gov/​](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)), the
    National Futures Association (NFA) BASIC search ([https://​www.​nfa.​futures.​org/​basicnet/​](https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/))
    and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Brokercheck® ([https://​brokercheck.​finra.​org/​](https://brokercheck.finra.org/)).
    Additionally, regulators such as UK FCA publish lists of unauthorized firms and
    individuals that they have received complaints about that they advise investors
    to check when being solicited from new investors that they suspect may be clone
    scams ([https://​www.​fca.​org.​uk/​consumers/​unauthorised-firms-individuals](https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/unauthorised-firms-individuals)).[^(24)](#FPar1)

    A large motivation for this interest was that investments in crypto were largely
    viewed among Turkish retail investors as a way to hedge against a declining Turkish
    lira coupled with double-digit inflation.[^(25)](#FPar1) February 2021 research
    had shown that cryptocurrency had become so popular in Turkey that the country
    accounted for approximately 16% of the total $1 billion to $2 billion global daily
    traded cryptocurrency volume.[^(26)](#FPar1)

    fintech firms have pushed back on the crypto ban and pursued legal action in court
    in an attempt to overturn the ban.[^(28)](#FPar1) A few days later two major Turkish
    crypto platforms, Thodex and Vebitcoin collapsed resulting in large investor losses.

    have resulted in the outright theft of assets. Many of these investor losses have
    been accompanied by the actual or alleged disappearance of the founders of the
    firm involved in founding and running the crypto firm involved in the theft. These
    types of situations are referred to as ***exit scams***, because a key individual,
    or group of individuals, central to the project simply exits the projects and
    leaves investors in the lurch. In addition to the losses resulting in the Africrypt
    case, an alleged exit scam referenced in Chapter six, there are unfortunately
    a number of examples of this over the past few years that involved alleged exit
    scams. The Turkish case of Thodex is another case in which an alleged exit scam
    occurred resulting in investors losses.

    offline and that its CEO Faruk Fatih Ozer had allegedly stolen $2 billion of investors’
    funds with him and then fled to Albania.[^(29)](#FPar1) Thodex was originally
    founded in 2017, and at the time of its abrupt closure had approximately 400,000
    users that were trading over $585 million in cryptocurrencies at the time of its
    failure.[^(30)](#FPar1) Interestingly a few days before users were unable to access
    their funds on Thodex, it was reported that the company’s main website posted
    a message that it was halting all transactions for approximately five days in
    order to evaluate a potential partnership offer.[^(31)](#FPar1) Based in part
    on complaints from Thodex users that they could not access their funds on the
    platform, the Istanbul Anatolian Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office began an investigation
    into the firm for, “fraud” and, “establishing a criminal organization.”[^(32)](#FPar1)
    A warrant was subsequently issued for Mr. Ozer’s arrest, and the Turkish justice
    ministry undertook proceedings to have him extradited from Albania. Turkey engaged
    the international community in an attempt to locate Mr. Ozer and Interpol eventually
    issued Red Notice for Mr. Ozer detailing the charges as, “Establishing Organizations
    for the Purpose of Committing Crimes -Aggravated Fraud.”[^(33)](#FPar1) A Red
    Notice is a, “request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally
    arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.”[^(34)](#FPar1)

    nature.[^(35)](#FPar1) Since revelations of the scandal first came to light a
    number of different theories as to what exactly occurred in the case and where
    the missing money went. In one instance, a Turkish mafia leader garnered headlines
    by publicly alleging that a Turkish Interior Minister received payments from the
    Thodex CEO.[^(36)](#FPar1) As part of the ongoing investigation a Turkish court
    detained over 80 suspects and jailed six individuals including Mr. Ozer’s brother,
    sister, and senior company employees as they awaited trial.[^(37)](#FPar1) After
    the failure of Thodex, it was reported that a second crypto trading platform named
    Vebitcoin decided to cease activities.

    not proceed with a total prohibition on cryptocurrency but instead indicated plans
    to revise the countries existing crypto regulatory framework and enact broader
    crypto legislation. Measures being considered include setting up a central custodian
    bank to eliminate counterparty risk in crypto, establishing minimum capital requirements
    for crypto exchanges, and mandating educational requirements for executives at
    those firms. Additionally, in May 2021 it was reported that Turkey reclassified
    firms that provided cryptocurrency assets to be subject to anti-money laundering
    and terrorist financing regulations which then provided Turkish regulators with
    additional tools to investigate crypto holdings more easily.[^(38)](#FPar1)

    case studies. The chapter began with an overview of cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes.
    As part of this discussion, the influence of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), Fear,
    Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) and the meme economy were discussed as contributors
    to creating an environment that supported crypto fraud. Several case studies were
    then discussed that included the use of crypto related options, revenue sharing
    arrangements for capital raising, multi-level marketing (MLM) tactics, affinity
    scams, crypto lending, clone firm scams, and exit scams. The chapter concluded
    with an analysis of the continued evolution of Turkey’s crypto regulations and
    the failure of the Thodex and Vebitcoin crypto exchanges. With an established
    understanding of crypto operations and compliance that has now been reiterated
    by real-world case studies, in the next chapter we will not turn our focus to
    Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Compliance and Operations.
