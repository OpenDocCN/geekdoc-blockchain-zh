- en: ConclusionWhen you’re learning something new it’s not advisable to jump in at
    the deep end. What you have here is a ten thousand foot view of JavaScript.Having
    a theoretical knowledge of it will always be beneficial to you and it’s something
    nobody can take away from you. Both theoretical and practical knowledge are important
    when learning how to code, but having purely practical knowledge can be limiting.
    You need to have an understanding of the concepts behind the code you’ve set out
    to learn. Problem solving while coding will come easily to you, because you will
    have an in-depth knowledge of how everything works from the bottom up.The software
    development field is constantly growing and changing, so knowing the fundamentals
    of JavaScript means that you will always be able to keep up with any updates.Whenever
    we say JavaScript is everywhere, we’re not just saying that, it is literally everywhere!
    It’s not just something we use on web browsers. It can also be used to program
    electronic toys, wifi connected coffee machines and mobile apps.According to the
    2021 StackOverflow developer survey, JavaScript is used by 94.5% of all websites.As
    far as career opportunities go, the possibilities are endless. The tech industry
    is always hiring and is one of the only career fields that is employee centric.
    They understand that employee satisfaction leads to productivity. You are constantly
    learning and also very likely to move up the ladder fairly quickly because there’s
    always room to grow.You can become a front-end, back-end or full stack developer.A
    front-end developer uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build websites from scratch.
    It’s an exciting job because every website is different, so the chances of doing
    the same thing everyday are slim. Front end developers need to ensure they are
    up to date with all the changes happening in the field, so if there is a downside
    it’s that they need to constantly do research.A back-end developer works on the
    server-side. Back end development is the management of the server and the database
    of any website. They create the environment that makes it possible for front-end
    development to exist.A full stack developer works on both the client-side and
    the server side. It’s like being in the middle. They are responsible for everything
    that happens when the front-end and back-end meet. Full stack developers can design
    software and then debug it as well. Full stack developers can work on small programming
    projects alone. Building a website for an individual can be done by one person.There
    is a big demand in the Job market for JavaScript developers because not all people
    who are employed in the tech industry have an in-depth knowledge of it. The average
    basic salary of a JavaScript developer in the United States is approximately $111,823
    per annum.There are a lot of self-taught JavaScript developers working today.
