- en: Beginning during 2017 and continuing well into 2018, with multiple rejections
    and failures, but also several successes, the concept of a stablecoin holds appeal
    for various market participants (Lee [2018](#CR4)). First, by linking an otherwise
    cryptocurrency to an established currency and monetary system, some of the volatility
    associated with these items would be reduced. One need to just look at the price
    action in Bitcoin during 2017 to see evidence as to how that might dissuade some
    more conservative investors and firms from embracing these technologies and assets
    as a viable alternative to traditional fiat currencies. The true value add, in
    the context of a stablecoin, however, is not so much which currency it happens
    to be linked to, as that may very well vary depending on the stablecoin in question.
    Dollars will be the focus of this conversation, but any fiat currency can be used
    as a peg or support for a token. Let’s take a look into just how a stable coin
    works and is different from existing cryptocurrencies, even though the cryptography
    may very well be similar in nature (Fig. [5.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_5_Chapter/467992_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_5_Chapter/467992_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.png)

    model is increasingly evident from the reality that, on a consistent basis, organizations
    and different institutions have been issuing stablecoins into the market (Wieczner
    [2018](#CR9)). In addition to the lower volatility (more on that later) associated
    with stablecoins in general, individual organizations are also issuing individual
    stablecoins that appear appropriate for the broader market conversation. Organizations
    that include, but are not limited to the Wall Street Journal, PWC, and numerous
    other large institutions are either in the process of developing cryptocurrencies
    and private blockchain models, or have already done so. The attractiveness of
    the stablecoin model, however, is not limited to only the largest organizations
    on the planet, but can also drive the decision making process across industry
    lines. In order for the benefits and potential of stablecoins to be realized,

- en: First, a solid working definition of a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is
    pegged to another stable asset, such as – again- the dollar or some gold reserves.
    So even though the underlying cryptocurrency technology may still be in play and
    be used by this asset, the resulting product has lower volatility due to the fact
    that it is linked to some other tangible asset. This actually allows for the practical
    usage of this cryptocurrency for things like paying for items, and using a cryptocurrency
    as medium of exchange versus simply as an investment tool. The stability of price,
    versus the dramatic price swings that have characterized the bitcoin market as
    of the writing of this research, is important for two financial reasons. Price
    stability  in the short term allows for these items to actually be used for transactions –
    merchants are more likely to accept a method of payment that does not radically
    swing up and down in value by 20% on a daily or weekly basis. Viewed in the long
    term, price stability allows stablecoins to become a viable alternative investment
    choice for a broader range of market participants. Broader adoption and integration
    within portfolios will also help maintain the stability of price.

    services professionals. Kicking off the transition and potential paradigm shift
    in the space, on September 10, 2018, the New York Department of Financial Services –
    considered to be among the strictest regulators of cryptocurrencies – approved
    the introduced of Gemini Dollar and Paxos Standard. Both stablecoins are backed
    by U.S. dollars on a 1:1 basis, and are subject to periodic audits to help ensure
    the validity of the 1:1 backing. In addition to being supported and backed by
    USD on a 1:1 basis, users of either stablecoin will also have the ability, at
    any time, to trade in coins for dollars, to be sent to whatever receiving address

- en: As the valuations and value associated with these coins become more apparent
    and more easily verifiable, both attestation professionals and organizations dependent
    on the verification of data will be more comfortable using these assets as actual
    assets (Tomkies and Valentine [2019](#CR7)). This links back to directly to the
    current uncertainty and confusion that exists around the reporting, custody, and
    documentation of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets. Without firm guidance
    from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and therefore no GAAP or
    IFRS recommendation for treatment or classification, the regulatory landscape
    is murky at best. The IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as property, which therefore
    means that anytime a cryptocurrency changes ownership – whether it is used as
    a medium or exchange or not – there is the possibility of an income tax event.
    Contrasting this, the S.E.C., in June 2018, attempted to clarify the reporting
    or cryptocurrency from an accounting and financial point of view, but in essence
    created a dual hierarchy of cryptocurrencies. Put simply, if a cryptocurrency
    is considered to be truly decentralized – such as Bitcoin or Ethereum – it will
    be treated as a commodity, but other more recently launched cryptocurrencies would
    be classified and categorized as equity securities. This differing treatment clearly
    creates an opportunity for financial services professionals to add value in this
    rapidly evolving asset and financial space.

    [2019](#CR7)）。这直接关联到当前存在的关于加密货币和其他加密资产报告、托管和文档的不确定性和混淆。由于财务会计准则委员会（FASB）没有明确指南，因此也没有对待或分类的通用会计原则（GAAP）或国际财务报告准则（IFRS）建议，监管形势最好是混沌的。国税局将加密货币定义为财产，这意味着每当加密货币更改所有权时——无论是否用作媒介或交易——都存在所得税事件的可能性。相比之下，证券交易委员会（S.E.C.）在2018年6月试图从会计和财务角度澄清了加密货币的报告，但本质上创造了加密货币的双重等级制度。简而言之，如果加密货币被认为是真正去中心化的——比如比特币或以太坊——它将被视为商品，而其他最近推出的加密货币将被归类为股票证券。这种不同的处理显然为金融服务专业人士在这个快速发展的资产和金融领域提供了增值机会。

    environment and landscape as fast moving and developing as quickly as the cryptocurrency
    market, the stewardship function of financial services practitioners is increasingly
    important. Following the financial crisis, and particularly for the investing
    generations that are increasingly emerging as players in the space – millennial
    and Gen-Z – the trust factor that had been traditionally associated with expertise
    may not exist going forward. Drilling down specifically, and especially taking

    clarify some outstanding questions. While, for example, cryptocurrencies themselves

    to be an active issue in the business landscape. As of this writing, however,
    the treatment of crypto based assets and items as currency equivalents remains –
    at least in the United States – impractical due to the regulatory classification  of
    cryptocurrencies as property for tax reporting purposes. In addition to this place
    in the regulatory landscape in which cryptocurrencies currently reside, there
    is also a practical matter that seems to be preventing the adoption of different
    cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets as current items. Put simply, currencies must
    be able to settle and pay off debts in a legal court of law, and with the exception
    of Ohio (which in late 2018 allowed state residents to pay state taxes with bitcoin)
    that seems to be an open issue.

- en: Second, a classification and reporting structure akin to inventories or commodities
    has also been put forward by various parties as a viable option for reporting
    cryptocurrencies. On top of the rather obvious valuation issues connected to inventory
    items such as FIFO, LIFO, or other inventory methodologies, it also must be taken
    into account what the actual use case for these items are. In the case of a broker
    dealer, or an organization that otherwise makes a market in the cryptocurrency
    space, it may seem appropriate and reasonable to classify these different items
    as inventory. Given other scenarios, however, and since it appears that the majority
    of investors and cryptocurrency owners invest in these assets as investments and
    not as core to the business itself, an inventory classification does not seem
    to be appropriate for broad based adoption.

  zh: 其次，与各方提出的类似库存或商品的分类和报告结构也被认为是报告加密货币的可行选择。除了与库存项目相关的明显估值问题，比如先进先出法、后进先出法或其他库存方法，还必须考虑这些项目的实际用例是什么。对于经纪人贷款方或在加密货币领域进行市场交易的组织来说，将这些不同项目分类为库存似乎是合适和合理的。然而，在其他情况下，由于似乎大多数投资者和加密货币所有者将这些资产作为投资而非业务核心，将其分类为库存似乎并不适合广泛采用。

    conversation given the reality that in the United States the CFTC has weighed

    the thicket of regulation and debate that is already being generated by the different
    regulatory bodies, also creates opportunities for financial services professionals.

    and control structure that drives decision making, resource allocation, and objectives
    from one central source (Stockard [1973](#CR5)). Even in organizations that have
    embraced a flat hierarchy or a distributed management structure there is, virtually
    without exception, a central decision maker or authority figure that ultimately
    has oversight and control over final decisions. This central command structure,

    scale, and efficiency has led to the consolidation of market participants in food,
    technology, manufacturing, and even financial services. Such consolidation brings
    with it organizational benefits – efficiencies of scale, the ability to fund and
    support large projects, and the capability to compete both domestically and internationally.
    In short, consolidation and the increased efficiency encompassed therein does
    come with associated benefits. That said, such a representation is an incomplete

    restrict access to information, insights, or feedback aided by information asymmetry;
    data and information are available to virtually everyone interested in obtaining
    it. In addition to improving culture and operating philosophies at organizations,
    however, there is a direct financial connection and link between governance, DAOs,
    and financial professionals. Particularly following the financial crisis of 2007–2008,
    which uncovered a number of wrong doings and corporate malfeasances, there is
    an increasing number of campaigns and initiatives underway to change how corporate
    actors interact with the broader marketplace.

    issues, human rights compliance, employee engagement, or improving the connection
    between financial results and operational performance, governance increasingly
    dominates investor conversations. With some of the largest investment managers
    and funds, including the largest on a global basis (Blackrock), taking a more
    active role in governance conversations, the implications are clear. DAOs, opening
    up the market to organizations and individuals to engage in business activities
    also invites potentially unethical actors to be involved with organizations. Even
    if the individuals and organizations are not unethical or imbued with malicious
    intent, different frameworks, mindsets, and outlooks may result in a muddled picture
    of just how the organization operates and engages with market participants. At
    this point, and something that can be perceived as a point of concern or opportunity,
    is that regulation and oversight of the DAO community are evolving alongside the
    technology itself.

- en: First, and perhaps most obviously, with a decentralized and encrypted method
    of business management, a question that must be addressed by practitioners is
    who is actually in charge of tax and financial reporting. If this sounds similar
    to the issues linked to corporate governance for an organization operating with
    a DAO that is because the same issues are also a concern for accounting practitioners
    (Carlson and Selin [2018](#CR1)). Having a point of contact does centralize the
    decision making process, but also creates a single point of failure for both technical
    information and operational data. Second, and linking to the concept of a single
    point of failure, the idea of a DAO is not substantially different from a cloud
    based network that allows different members to have different levels of access
    to data. CPAs and financial professionals are already used to dealing with a relatively
    diversified array of individuals with access to potentially sensitive data, but
    a DAO takes the concept one step further. Allowing ownership and investment in
    the organization to also be decentralized provides a wider array of individuals
    the opportunity to participate in management, but also opens the organization
    to more possible instances of unethical activity.

  zh: 首先，显而易见的是，在去中心化和加密的业务管理方法下，从业者必须解决的一个问题是谁实际上负责税收和财务报告。如果这听起来与在DAO运营的组织相关的公司治理问题相似，那是因为这些问题对会计从业者也同样重要（Carlson
    and Selin [2018](#CR1)）。拥有一个联络点确实集中了决策过程，但也为技术信息和运营数据创建了单点故障。其次，与单点故障的概念相联系，DAO的概念与允许不同成员对数据具有不同访问级别的基于云的网络并无太大差异。会计师和金融专业人员已经习惯于处理具备潜在敏感数据访问权限的相对多样化的个人，但DAO将这一概念推进了一步。允许组织的所有权和投资也去中心化，为更多人提供了参与管理的机会，但也使组织面临更多可能的不道德活动。
- en: Third, and arguably most important in the context of what CPAs will have to
    contend with as DAOs become more widespread, financial reporting and coordinating
    the flow of data between different owners will become simultaneously simpler and
    more complicated. Complicating this process will be the possibility that, despite
    the intentions of management professionals or founders, the ownership of the firm
    may appear to be shrouded in layers of encryption. Making sure that the different
    transactions and business events occurring within the DAO, and between the DAO
    and (potentially) other DAOs comply with existing regulations and reporting requirements
    will be a core fiduciary responsibility of practitioners. These conversations
    and decisions may appear to be contradictory when juxtaposed against the concepts
    of blockchain and DAOs in the abstract, but will be necessary for such technology
    tools to become adopted for mainstream utilization. Regulation will inevitably
    change and evolve over time, but that does not mean that the guidance and frameworks
    already in existence will become rendered obsolete or unimportant. Rather, for
    professionals to adapt and evolve alongside the marketplace at large, being aware
    of current and future regulations will inevitably be important.

  zh: 第三，在CPA将不得不应对的DAO变得更加普及的情况下，会计师要面对的可能是最重要的，财务报告和协调数据流将变得同时更简单和更复杂。使这一过程复杂化的可能性在于，尽管管理专业人员或创始人的意图，公司的所有权可能被隐藏在层层加密之中。确保DAO内部以及DAO与（可能的）其他DAO之间发生的不同交易和业务事件符合现有的法规和报告要求将成为从业人员的核心受托责任。这些对话和决定在抽象的区块链和DAO概念对立面可能看起来矛盾，但对于这些技术工具成为主流利用的必要条件。监管必然会随时间改变和发展，但这并不意味着已经存在的指导和框架将变得过时或不重要。相反，为了从业人员能够与市场一起适应和发展，了解当前和未来的监管将不可避免地重要。

  zh: 第5章总结
- en: Building on the content that had been covered in Chap. [4](467992_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    this chapter analyzes and approaches one of the most important emerging topics
    in the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency space; stablecoins. Often referred
    to as a hybrid or halfway point between traditional fiat currencies and fully
    decentralized cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other types of enterprise tokens
    are rapidly gaining support and momentum. Financial services professionals, be
    they employed in the accounting or finance fields, must understand not only how
    these coins operate from a technological perspective, but also what they mean
    from a financial structures perspective. Although not a full blown solution to
    the price instability and regulatory uncertainty associated with many cryptocurrencies,
    these asset backed coins do seem to represent a logical halfway point between
    traditional fiat and cryptocurrency. That said, and even though these assets may
    indeed be backed or supported by fiat currency or other assets, it is important
    to recognize the fact that these items have not yet achieved regulatory certainty.
    While the enterprise token launched by JP Morgan may be the highest profile example
    and application of a stablecoin to date, being pegged 1:1 to the USD, there are
    several differentiating factors between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies
    that make them applicable for broader business adoption. Practitioners seeking
    to not only get a better handle on the cryptocurrency market and ecosystem, but
    also be aware of how these assets fit into traditional financial structures and
    investment opportunities must have a solid understanding and comprehension of
    how stablecoins operate and fit within the blockchain ecosystem.
