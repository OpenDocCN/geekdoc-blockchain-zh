    the attention of virtually every regulatory agency both in the United States and
    overseas, and this does not appear to be a passing trend. As the market for blockchain
    based cryptocurrencies continues to expand and develop in nature, including institutional
    investment opportunities there is a growing need for price stabilization and clearer
    reporting requirements.

    itself is the fact that these items are not tied or tethered to any fiat (or government
    issued) currency. Appealing both to individuals with a libertarian bent to politics
    and worldviews, as well as individuals and institutions traumatized by the financial
    crisis, this lack of association with traditional monetary supply and policy has
    been seen as a core benefit of cryptocurrency technology. That said, there does
    appear to be a market for cryptocurrencies and other such assets that are indeed
    supported and backed by fiat currencies. These items are called stablecoins, and
    a relatively new entrant into the broader cryptocurrency and blockchain space,
    but may also represent a shift in both of how many individuals and institutions
    use various cryptocurrencies and how these impact the broader financial services

    and failures, but also several successes, the concept of a stablecoin holds appeal
    for various market participants (Lee [2018](#CR4)). First, by linking an otherwise
    cryptocurrency to an established currency and monetary system, some of the volatility
    associated with these items would be reduced. One need to just look at the price
    action in Bitcoin during 2017 to see evidence as to how that might dissuade some
    more conservative investors and firms from embracing these technologies and assets
    as a viable alternative to traditional fiat currencies. The true value add, in
    the context of a stablecoin, however, is not so much which currency it happens
    to be linked to, as that may very well vary depending on the stablecoin in question.
    Dollars will be the focus of this conversation, but any fiat currency can be used
    as a peg or support for a token. Let’s take a look into just how a stable coin
    works and is different from existing cryptocurrencies, even though the cryptography
    may very well be similar in nature (Fig. [5.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_5_Chapter/467992_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_5_Chapter/467992_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.png)

    model is increasingly evident from the reality that, on a consistent basis, organizations
    and different institutions have been issuing stablecoins into the market (Wieczner
    [2018](#CR9)). In addition to the lower volatility (more on that later) associated
    with stablecoins in general, individual organizations are also issuing individual
    stablecoins that appear appropriate for the broader market conversation. Organizations
    that include, but are not limited to the Wall Street Journal, PWC, and numerous
    other large institutions are either in the process of developing cryptocurrencies
    and private blockchain models, or have already done so. The attractiveness of
    the stablecoin model, however, is not limited to only the largest organizations
    on the planet, but can also drive the decision making process across industry
    lines. In order for the benefits and potential of stablecoins to be realized,
    however, financial professionals must be aware of not only how these tools work,
    but also how these stablecoins will interact with the broader financial system.

- en: First, a solid working definition of a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is
    pegged to another stable asset, such as – again- the dollar or some gold reserves.
    So even though the underlying cryptocurrency technology may still be in play and
    be used by this asset, the resulting product has lower volatility due to the fact
    that it is linked to some other tangible asset. This actually allows for the practical
    usage of this cryptocurrency for things like paying for items, and using a cryptocurrency
    as medium of exchange versus simply as an investment tool. The stability of price,
    versus the dramatic price swings that have characterized the bitcoin market as
    of the writing of this research, is important for two financial reasons. Price
    stability  in the short term allows for these items to actually be used for transactions –
    merchants are more likely to accept a method of payment that does not radically
    swing up and down in value by 20% on a daily or weekly basis. Viewed in the long
    term, price stability allows stablecoins to become a viable alternative investment
    choice for a broader range of market participants. Broader adoption and integration
    within portfolios will also help maintain the stability of price.

    cryptocurrency space, but they do actually represent a fundamental shift in how
    the cryptocurrency market is classified, reported, and evaluated by financial
    services professionals. Kicking off the transition and potential paradigm shift
    in the space, on September 10, 2018, the New York Department of Financial Services –
    considered to be among the strictest regulators of cryptocurrencies – approved
    the introduced of Gemini Dollar and Paxos Standard. Both stablecoins are backed
    by U.S. dollars on a 1:1 basis, and are subject to periodic audits to help ensure
    the validity of the 1:1 backing. In addition to being supported and backed by
    USD on a 1:1 basis, users of either stablecoin will also have the ability, at
    any time, to trade in coins for dollars, to be sent to whatever receiving address
    is specified. This increased auditability and availability of information associated
    with stable coins will invariably have an impact on the role that financial professionals
    play in this space.

- en: As the valuations and value associated with these coins become more apparent
    and more easily verifiable, both attestation professionals and organizations dependent
    on the verification of data will be more comfortable using these assets as actual
    assets (Tomkies and Valentine [2019](#CR7)). This links back to directly to the
    current uncertainty and confusion that exists around the reporting, custody, and
    documentation of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets. Without firm guidance
    from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and therefore no GAAP or
    IFRS recommendation for treatment or classification, the regulatory landscape
    is murky at best. The IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as property, which therefore
    means that anytime a cryptocurrency changes ownership – whether it is used as
    a medium or exchange or not – there is the possibility of an income tax event.
    Contrasting this, the S.E.C., in June 2018, attempted to clarify the reporting
    or cryptocurrency from an accounting and financial point of view, but in essence
    created a dual hierarchy of cryptocurrencies. Put simply, if a cryptocurrency
    is considered to be truly decentralized – such as Bitcoin or Ethereum – it will
    be treated as a commodity, but other more recently launched cryptocurrencies would
    be classified and categorized as equity securities. This differing treatment clearly
    creates an opportunity for financial services professionals to add value in this
    rapidly evolving asset and financial space.

    are, clearly, still emerging as the field itself continues to evolve, change,
    and develop in response to market needs, but there do appear to be several considerations
    that need to be considered. As different, traditionally non-financial services
    players, enter the marketplace it is going to be interesting to observe how traditional
    players such as SWIFT respond (Crosman [2019](#CR2)). Especially in a business
    environment and landscape as fast moving and developing as quickly as the cryptocurrency
    market, the stewardship function of financial services practitioners is increasingly
    important. Following the financial crisis, and particularly for the investing
    generations that are increasingly emerging as players in the space – millennial
    and Gen-Z – the trust factor that had been traditionally associated with expertise
    may not exist going forward. Drilling down specifically, and especially taking
    into account the volatility, failures, and associated doubts linked to the stablecoin
    space, there are several areas that any fiduciary in the space must be aware of
    moving forward.
  prefs: []

    linked to the stableoin issued by Tether (USDT) this is not merely an academic
    exercise, but one that can cost both you and your clients financially. Although
    tether may have been the first stablecoin to market, and dominate the conversation
    in this sub-sector of the cryptocurrency space, the breaking of the buck that
    occurred in the fall of 2018 has cast large amount of uncertainty linked to the
    entire asset class. Financial professionals must be aware of these challenges
    facing the space, but also must be aware of how these challenges are driving the
    overall market for both stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. Put simply, these
    are the types of questions that are going to be asked as cryptocurrencies continue
    to increase both in value at large as well as utilization as a medium of exchange.
    Stablecoins may seem like a potentially alternative that blends the best of both
    worlds – and ultimately may do exactly that – but both accountants and finance
    professionals must be aware of how to address these issues.

    is something that everyone involved in this space must understand in order to
    deliver guidance. Something that might, incorrectly, be assumed is that since
    the different stablecoins that have been introduced to the marketplace have tended
    to be pegged to the USD is that all of these stablecoins can be classified and
    thought of as nearly identical. Such an approach, although appealing, is incomplete
    and can lead to incorrect decision making (Hackett et al. [2019](#CR3)). A few

    was the audit performed by a reputable firm with a track record of expertise in
    this space? These may seem like redundant questions or topics to address, but
    with several of the major stablecoins – particularly tether – having experienced
    issues recently with regards to their valuation and validity of dollar reserves,

    been numerous white papers and publications issued into the marketplace by both
    industry associations and individual firms seeking to reassure both investors

    can make it difficult for practitioners and organizations to accurately and consistently

    to muddying the proverbial waters, also opens the door for unethical and potentially
    fraudulent events to occur and happen both in the United States and abroad (Voris

    to be an active issue in the business landscape. As of this writing, however,
    the treatment of crypto based assets and items as currency equivalents remains –
    at least in the United States – impractical due to the regulatory classification  of
    cryptocurrencies as property for tax reporting purposes. In addition to this place
    in the regulatory landscape in which cryptocurrencies currently reside, there
    is also a practical matter that seems to be preventing the adoption of different
    cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets as current items. Put simply, currencies must
    be able to settle and pay off debts in a legal court of law, and with the exception
    of Ohio (which in late 2018 allowed state residents to pay state taxes with bitcoin)
    that seems to be an open issue.

    has also been put forward by various parties as a viable option for reporting
    cryptocurrencies. On top of the rather obvious valuation issues connected to inventory
    items such as FIFO, LIFO, or other inventory methodologies, it also must be taken
    into account what the actual use case for these items are. In the case of a broker
    dealer, or an organization that otherwise makes a market in the cryptocurrency
    space, it may seem appropriate and reasonable to classify these different items
    as inventory. Given other scenarios, however, and since it appears that the majority
    of investors and cryptocurrency owners invest in these assets as investments and
    not as core to the business itself, an inventory classification does not seem
    to be appropriate for broad based adoption.

    the thicket of regulation and debate that is already being generated by the different
    regulatory bodies, also creates opportunities for financial services professionals.
    Depending on what the ultimate classification and reporting of cryptoassets end
    up being, this may actually create additional consulting and advisory lines for
    practitioners across the financial services landscape.

    perhaps a sophisticated evolution of blockchain as well as a paradigm shift in

    through history and connected to the present day, is one of a centralized command
    and control structure that drives decision making, resource allocation, and objectives
    from one central source (Stockard [1973](#CR5)). Even in organizations that have
    embraced a flat hierarchy or a distributed management structure there is, virtually
    without exception, a central decision maker or authority figure that ultimately
    has oversight and control over final decisions. This central command structure,

    increasingly decentralized platform for decision making and responding to market
    conditions, it has also had the inverse effect among certain industries. One need
    to only look across the industry landscape to see prime examples of how technology,
    scale, and efficiency has led to the consolidation of market participants in food,
    technology, manufacturing, and even financial services. Such consolidation brings
    with it organizational benefits – efficiencies of scale, the ability to fund and
    support large projects, and the capability to compete both domestically and internationally.
    In short, consolidation and the increased efficiency encompassed therein does
    come with associated benefits. That said, such a representation is an incomplete
    view of what exactly technology and consolidation is capable of delivering. Especially
    in the realm of financial services, which are literally at the whim of global

    rather obviously, decentralized in how they operate, function, and conduct business.
    Blockchain technology is, driven by the fundamental nature of how the technology
    operates, a decentralized and distributed system. The idea of a decentralized
    autonomous organization, or an organization that basically runs itself, may seem
    like it belongs to the realm of science fiction. That, however, is an incomplete
    view not reflective of just how fast blockchain technology is advancing in the
    marketplace.

    working models are still in prototype or beta stages at the current point, the
    sheer volume and number of initiatives means that more advanced applications are
    inevitable. As increasingly sophisticated smart contracts spread throughout the
    marketplace the idea of an organization whose operating bylaws and agreements
    are augmented and automated by blockchain technology may not appear as far fetched
    as might be initially surmised.

    a new technology, platform, or tool enters the marketplace is the possibility
    of buzz, over excitement, and inevitable disappointment. The same issues that
    currently plague organizations and management professionals, namely information
    security and technology issues and possible failings related to corporate governance
    will not magically be solved with the utilization of new technology. DAOs represent
    an innovative way to create and manage organizations, decentralize the command
    and control structure that can hamstring decision making, and create new opportunities
    for business development. That said, there are implications of both a positive
    and negative nature that business professionals and financial services professionals
    must be aware of.

    risks, especially if someone does eventually go wrong. No matter what preventative
    measures are taken, safeguard implemented, and guardrails built into the software
    underpinning the DAO there is always the risk that something will go wrong. This
    was perhaps shown in the most high profile ways on the Ethereum blockchain. A
    DAO, possibly the first DAO introduced to the market, but in any case one of the
    first rolled out for investor utilization, had a flaw in the software code that
    was exploited by nefarious actors. A total of $150 million was stolen and – more
    importantly – this actually led to the direct intervention in the Ethereum blockchain
    from the inventor of the blockchain itself, Vitalik Buterin. Such direct interference
    and direct hands on approach to resolving this issue exposed a critical flaw in
    the DAO concept. If the organization itself is truly decentralized and operating
    on a public blockchain platform, how will issues be resolved as they do arise?
    Demonstrated by this example this is not an academic or theoretical concern; serious
    business implications can result.

- en: The implications of DAOs, at the current state of product development, are difficult
    to ascertain with any high degree of specificity, but even at this early stage
    there are some applications that are identifiable (Telpner and Ahmadifar [2017](#CR6)).
    First, with entire organizations operating in a decentralized and, at least to
    some extent, decentralized manner there will be more opportunities for larger
    numbers of individuals to participate. Harkening back to some of the initial euphoria
    and excitement surrounding Bitcoin, the democratization of information, money,
    and the transmission of data will be amplified with the rise of DAOs. Second,
    and building on this first point, as more and more individuals are able to set
    up decentralized and encrypted organizations, there will be an increased need
    for safeguards and protections. Just as many early exchanges, traders, and leaders
    associated with cryptocurrencies experienced legal troubles at different stages,
    there will have to be protocols in place to comply with AML, KYC, the Patriot
    Act, and other regulations.

- en: Overstating the importance of blockchain applications remaining in compliance
    with financial regulations, standards, and frameworks would be difficult, as this
    represents perhaps the most difficult to solve issue in the space. The question
    in the blockchain space is not whether or not the technology itself works; organizations
    are already using blockchain for some enterprise scale commercial applications.
    Rather, the question is quickly becoming whether or not blockchain will be able
    to garner mainstream adoption and implementation as regulators become more interested
    in the space. Both in the United States as well as overseas, hearings are being
    convened, testimony is being given, and the conversation around the broader blockchain
    ecosystem is quickly moving toward one of increasing regulation and oversight.
    That is not to say that increased regulation will necessarily be a negative development,
    but it is something that must be taken accounted for by organizations operating
    in the space.

    the implications that DAOs will have on how organizations deal with corporate
    governance issues. Regardless of industry affiliation or geographic location,
    there does appear to be increasingly large amounts of pressure on management professionals
    to generate effective financial returns and do so in a sustainable manner. Governance,
    traditionally, has been handled by a small subset of individuals at an organization
    who, in turn, deal with a relatively limited number of external partners. With
    an organization that is entirely decentralized, at least partially anonymous,
    and with members that could literally be anywhere in the world, there is a question
    that must be asked. Who is it, exactly, that will be the face of the organization
    to interact with the public and market actors?

- en: This is not merely an academic or theoretical question, especially in an era
    where transparency, inclusivity, and holding people to account all appear to be
    on the upswing on a global basis. No longer can organizations or management professionals
    restrict access to information, insights, or feedback aided by information asymmetry;
    data and information are available to virtually everyone interested in obtaining
    it. In addition to improving culture and operating philosophies at organizations,
    however, there is a direct financial connection and link between governance, DAOs,
    and financial professionals. Particularly following the financial crisis of 2007–2008,
    which uncovered a number of wrong doings and corporate malfeasances, there is
    an increasing number of campaigns and initiatives underway to change how corporate
    actors interact with the broader marketplace.

    issues, human rights compliance, employee engagement, or improving the connection
    between financial results and operational performance, governance increasingly
    dominates investor conversations. With some of the largest investment managers
    and funds, including the largest on a global basis (Blackrock), taking a more
    active role in governance conversations, the implications are clear. DAOs, opening
    up the market to organizations and individuals to engage in business activities
    also invites potentially unethical actors to be involved with organizations. Even
    if the individuals and organizations are not unethical or imbued with malicious
    intent, different frameworks, mindsets, and outlooks may result in a muddled picture
    of just how the organization operates and engages with market participants. At
    this point, and something that can be perceived as a point of concern or opportunity,
    is that regulation and oversight of the DAO community are evolving alongside the
    technology itself.

    positioned to be dealing with the rise of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and advanced
    applications like DAOs. Often the liaison between the organization, management
    professionals, and the marketplace of end users, CPAs and other accounting professionals
    are already on the forefront of cryptocurrency questions and issues that have
    arisen alongside the growing interest in Bitcoin and cryptoassets. As of 2017
    and 2018, the majority of CPA interaction with the cryptocurrency space have been,
    not surprisingly, focused on the income tax and financial reporting angle, but
    that will inevitable continue to evolve as the market for blockchain matures and
    develops. Specifically, the implications of a decentralized operating model for
    organizations will, almost invariably, change the way accounting practitioners
    interact with clients and customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, and perhaps most obviously, with a decentralized and encrypted method
    of business management, a question that must be addressed by practitioners is
    who is actually in charge of tax and financial reporting. If this sounds similar
    to the issues linked to corporate governance for an organization operating with
    a DAO that is because the same issues are also a concern for accounting practitioners
    (Carlson and Selin [2018](#CR1)). Having a point of contact does centralize the
    decision making process, but also creates a single point of failure for both technical
    information and operational data. Second, and linking to the concept of a single
    point of failure, the idea of a DAO is not substantially different from a cloud
    based network that allows different members to have different levels of access
    to data. CPAs and financial professionals are already used to dealing with a relatively
    diversified array of individuals with access to potentially sensitive data, but
    a DAO takes the concept one step further. Allowing ownership and investment in
    the organization to also be decentralized provides a wider array of individuals
    the opportunity to participate in management, but also opens the organization
    to more possible instances of unethical activity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, and arguably most important in the context of what CPAs will have to
    contend with as DAOs become more widespread, financial reporting and coordinating
    the flow of data between different owners will become simultaneously simpler and
    more complicated. Complicating this process will be the possibility that, despite
    the intentions of management professionals or founders, the ownership of the firm
    may appear to be shrouded in layers of encryption. Making sure that the different
    transactions and business events occurring within the DAO, and between the DAO
    and (potentially) other DAOs comply with existing regulations and reporting requirements
    will be a core fiduciary responsibility of practitioners. These conversations
    and decisions may appear to be contradictory when juxtaposed against the concepts
    of blockchain and DAOs in the abstract, but will be necessary for such technology
    tools to become adopted for mainstream utilization. Regulation will inevitably
    change and evolve over time, but that does not mean that the guidance and frameworks
    already in existence will become rendered obsolete or unimportant. Rather, for
    professionals to adapt and evolve alongside the marketplace at large, being aware
    of current and future regulations will inevitably be important.

    for advisory services  based on an increasingly decentralized business landscape.
    It is difficult to overstate just how game changing and potentially paradigm shifting
    a shift toward a decentralized landscape and business model would be for the advisory
    landscape. As ideas, organizations, and ideas are diffused and distributed throughout
    the economy at large, the implication on both current services and opportunities
    for future services is significant. Prior to actually developing or offering these
    ideas and services, however, it seems important to asses the potential implications
    for blockchain and decentralization on the financial landscape itself. Put simply,
    the core functionality and role of the financial system will change as a result
    of decentralized or distributed business models become more and more common.

- en: Building on the content that had been covered in Chap. [4](467992_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    this chapter analyzes and approaches one of the most important emerging topics
    in the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency space; stablecoins. Often referred
    to as a hybrid or halfway point between traditional fiat currencies and fully
    decentralized cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other types of enterprise tokens
    are rapidly gaining support and momentum. Financial services professionals, be
    they employed in the accounting or finance fields, must understand not only how
    these coins operate from a technological perspective, but also what they mean
    from a financial structures perspective. Although not a full blown solution to
    the price instability and regulatory uncertainty associated with many cryptocurrencies,
    these asset backed coins do seem to represent a logical halfway point between
    traditional fiat and cryptocurrency. That said, and even though these assets may
    indeed be backed or supported by fiat currency or other assets, it is important
    to recognize the fact that these items have not yet achieved regulatory certainty.
    While the enterprise token launched by JP Morgan may be the highest profile example
    and application of a stablecoin to date, being pegged 1:1 to the USD, there are
    several differentiating factors between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies
    that make them applicable for broader business adoption. Practitioners seeking
    to not only get a better handle on the cryptocurrency market and ecosystem, but
    also be aware of how these assets fit into traditional financial structures and
    investment opportunities must have a solid understanding and comprehension of
    how stablecoins operate and fit within the blockchain ecosystem.
