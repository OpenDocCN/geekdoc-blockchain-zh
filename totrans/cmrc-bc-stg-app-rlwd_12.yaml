    the answer is the same as any new project or idea: follow the usual principles
    of best practice transformation, development, and project management. Just because
    the solution is Blockchain technology does not mean there is a different transformation
    process.'

    will be the key to unlocking the best practice for Blockchain technology in your
    enterprise. In this chapter, I will concentrate on the key areas specifically
    related to Blockchain technology to be successful – these are over and above your
    current transformation best practice.  ## Consensus'

- en: I have already covered consensus in the early chapters, but want to discuss
    further here as I believe this is critical to the success of Blockchain technology
    use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consensus involves agreeing at the start of a project how the participants in
    the Blockchain network wish to work together; i.e. how the data will be entered
    into the Blockchain in a way that all parties are happy with that data quality.
    This will not eliminate mistakes, but it will help develop trust between all the
    parties that the data is correct and can be used for analysis or other purposes
    agreed by the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Agreeing the consensus rules at the start is hard, but it gets easier with time
    and also as the different consensus principles become more and more common. At
    the beginning, they all seem quite difficult, but consensus has always been around
    in our world and is used in all our daily lives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consensus should be implemented with a business process transformation mindset.
    This is not about the technical rules of consensus – this is about how you want
    to run the network and the process the network will deliver. Concentrate on the
    process side of the Blockchain network and the technology will easily fit what
    you require the consensus technology to deliver.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be flexible and open to change with your consensus rules. We are still new to
    Blockchain technology and we will, and we are, iterating continually. The consensus
    mechanisms for a Blockchain network of 50 entities is not the same as one with
    500 entities across 500 enterprises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    grows. Having a great network management and administration plan is key to keeping
    the consensus up to date with your requirements, as the Blockchain network changes
    over time.  ## Governance'

- en: As with any transformational project, you must start the process with a clear
    plan and strategy. This needs to be managed with an exceptional governance process.
    The setting up of project/programme plans, a steering committee, regular milestones,
    and other best practice project management skills are needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to Blockchain technology crossing many parties, this governance is even
    more critical. You could be dealing with hundreds of different entities within
    the project, and this needs careful and thorough project management.
  prefs: []

    of milestones, you are unlikely to deliver a transformational Blockchain project.
    The actual technology side of the transformation is not the biggest challenge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In my experience, the people and process part of the transformation is critical
    in any project, but with Blockchain projects this is key. In theory, with a Blockchain
    technology-led transformation, you are taking some of the processes from the ‘back’
    of the process to the ‘front’ of the process – you are in essence reconciling
    and auditing the data, before it enters the Blockchain. This is a change of mindset
    and thinking for the people involved and needs to be clearly managed, explained,
    and governed.  ## Agile and Iterative Approach'

    is not yet 1.0 – I do believe this will happen in 2019 as the trials and proofs
    of concept grow exponentially though 2018 and 2019.

- en: In order to succeed, with Blockchain technology moving so quickly, you need
    to adopt an agile and iterative mindset to the Blockchain technology. There will
    not be one stable solution which is implemented easily in a period of time – you
    will be implementing a number of versions and variants as the process and the
    technology develops, and you learn from these stages.

- en: Concentrating on your minimum viable product (MVP) is key – you cannot afford
    to perfect the Blockchain technology solution on day one – too many changes are
    happening to do this. You can, however, adopt a number of MVPs which you develop
    quickly and test quickly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Test and learn takes on a critical role here – there are many moving parts around
    this technology, so you need to be quick to test and quick to record the learnings.
    Iteration then becomes a way of life as you develop the MVP into a better solution
    each day.
  prefs: []

    change it or throw it out.

    Blockchain solution for your customers.  ## Collaborate'

    in life, and with Blockchain projects this is a must. The technology is new. The
    white paper that launched Bitcoin was written in 2008 and it took until around
    2014 for a bigger network to be built around the technology. Ethereum went live
    in 2015 and grew over the next couple of years.

    technology development. This means that it is impossible to have lots of experts

    people as possible.

    and externally. Start-ups need to work with enterprises, enterprises need to work
    with government, and government needs to work with academia…we all need to work
    together on Blockchain technology solutions.
  prefs: []

    who are experienced in technology, business, government, etc., need to work with
    the youth of today, to find out how each other thinks. I know that the younger
    generations adapt to Blockchain thinking more quickly than older generations.

    equally to this exciting new revolution.

    to own Blockchain is not going to help you or the development of Blockchain technology.

    to record the ideas and source the solutions. Share the ideas and expertise on
    Blockchain and you will be able to see who came up with what idea, and who is
    the expert in which area within the Blockchain ecosystem.  ## Teams Need to Be
    Fully Bought In'

    and not a siloed operation. Blockchain spans the entire enterprise and beyond,
    ensuring that everybody is brought into the projects and process is very important.

    most people do not understand Blockchain technology and therefore need to understand
    the basics before they can add value and start to further the Blockchain technology
    solutions.

    30 minutes of what it is, use cases, etc., and advise them to spend the next three
    months researching and discussing with people. I believe it takes that amount
    of time for people to action the different processes and opportunities that Blockchain
    technology can offer.

    need a fully open mind to the possibilities of Blockchain technology – ignore
    the fake news and bad press, read the stories about how Blockchain technology

    these and how your life and enterprise can benefit from this revolution.
