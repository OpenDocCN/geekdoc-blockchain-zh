    Let’s think about what that means for a particular industry built on the existing
    system of double-entry bookkeeping: accountants. The Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte,
    Price Waterhouse, Ernst Young, and KPMG—seem to be taking an “if-you-can’t-fight-them-join-them”
    approach to the onset of blockchain technology. As of mid-2017, Deloitte alone
    had 250 people working in distributed ledger laboratories, and the other three
    are being similarly aggressive. Of course, these labs occupy a tiny sliver of
    these firms’ massive payrolls, but the dedicated R&D speaks to how seriously the
    companies view the technology. If immutable distributed ledgers become a reality,
    their audit and accounting divisions will eventually become obsolete, with a huge
    human impact. At just under 40 percent of their combined $127 billion in revenues,
    the firms’ audit and assurance divisions directly employ around 300,000 people.'

    clients. What will become clear to them is that accounting as we know it—as a
    quarterly exercise in which teams of people review samples of past transactions
    to judge the integrity of past events—will become obsolete. And the Big Four’s
    audit divisions are just the tip of the accounting business iceberg. It’s not
    just the big-name auditors at risk; it’s every auditor—including companies’ internal
    auditors. In fact, once account-keeping itself becomes fully automated and reconciliation
    functions become superfluous, both those who keep the books and those who audit
    them will be out of work. Machines will input the financial data, analyze the
    financial data, and audit the financial data—all within a few minutes, if not
    seconds. In the United States alone, there are 1.3 million people employed in
    accounting, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    profession, which is structured around the delayed release of official, audited
    financial figures, is also very much at risk. The investment cycle of Wall Street
    stock brokerage and research is built around those data releases—analysts come
    up with updated projections on what they expect a company’s quarterly earnings
    per share will look like; the market places its bets; and then, when the numbers
    are dumped on them every three months, investors re-calibrate the share price,
    either positively or negatively. Everything in equities revolves around the quarterly
    numbers. The same is true for asset managers at mutual funds, pension funds, and
    hedge funds, whose compensation is determined by how well their portfolios perform
    on a quarterly basis compared with the broader market. Even government bond traders
    march to the drum of delayed, audited releases of financial information, in their
    case economic indicators on estimates of inflation, unemployment, and GDP growth.

    that of a universal basic income, or UBI. Under this policy, which has been proposed
    by the UK Labour Party and is present in some form within a number of Scandinavian
    countries, governments provide a basic living wage to every adult citizen. This
    idea, first floated by Thomas Paine in the eighteenth century, has enjoyed a resurgence
    on the left as people have contemplated how robotics, artificial intelligence,
    and other technologies would hit working-class jobs such as truck driving. But
    it may gain wider traction as decentralizing forces based on blockchain models
    start destroying middle-class jobs. In fact, even though a universal basic income
    would, on the surface, run against the classic economic rationalist belief that
    state subsidies disincentivize work, the idea has some support on the right. One
    reason is that a simple, universally distributed transfer of this kind could be
    more efficiently distributed with far less waste and bureaucracy than a means-tested
    welfare system. Also, what exactly does “disincentivize work” mean when there
    isn’t any work to be had?

    to UBI, some are instead talking about “universal basic assets”: people are given
    an investable, ownership stake in our social and economic infrastructure. What
    if, for example, everyone owns shares in their local town’s distributed microgrid,
    represented in the form of a crypto solar-security? Would they use it as a down
    payment on a business that requires more energy inputs? Earlier in the book, we
    discussed things like reputation tokens and personal branded currencies, a concept
    that treats a personal skill set and stored labor more as a vehicle of wealth
    creation than as a service to exploit, and that potentially finds a way to incentivize

    dreamed of a political economy in which communally owned technology freed human

    selves. In his 1891 essay “The Soul of Man Under Socialism,” Oscar Wilde argued
    that “[s]ocialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others”
    and that in that utopian future, technology would relieve all people of work and
    allow “a man to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable
    gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world.” He said he
    had “no doubt at all that this is the future of machinery, and just as trees grow
    while the country gentleman is asleep, so while Humanity will be amusing itself,
    or enjoying cultivated leisure … or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful
    things, or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery
    will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant work.”

    where we discussed former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn’s vision of a car that
    was not only driverless but also ownerless. It wasn’t exactly socialism. But the
    result was similarly one of a machine acting in full service of a community. In
    essence, the car would be programmed via smart contracts and interactions with
    all sorts of other devices, online marketplaces, and systems to run at the most
    optimal value for all, filling itself up on gas at the best price and deciding
    when, based on the market, to make itself available and when not. The reason why
    a community would put such a thing into existence is that, as with The DAO–like
    cooperatives we discussed in chapter eight, there would be no profit motive to
    distract it from maximizing benefits for all. This is the kind of contemporary
    vision of public infrastructure that could be possible when the efficiencies of
    IoT connectivity are combined with the automated governance of distributed trust
    systems like blockchains. It paints a much more benign notion of technology as
    being designed to free human beings from work while improving the experience of

    can unleash everyone’s inner artist or poet and that, in this way, “each man will
    attain to his perfection”? (That he called this vision “new individualism” spoke
    to Wilde’s unorthodox, anarchistic version of socialism.) In the essay itself,
    the playwright, as if to get ahead of his critics, acknowledged that this notion
    was “unpractical, and it goes against human nature.” But that, he insisted, “is
    why it is worth carrying out.” Well, take a look at how humans behave in the twenty-first-century
    era of social media. It’s hard not to sense that most people with a Twitter account
    want a public voice. And while the “selfie” may not be high art, it’s hard to
    argue that the perpetual pouting and preening on Instagram isn’t a type of performance.
    There is something to the notion that we all want to release our inner creative
    selves. What’s interesting is that this technology is turning creation into a
    more collaborative process. Humor is now “crowdsourced”—think of how memes and
    hashtag jokes evolve, with each new witty version building on the last one. Music,
    brands, and subculture are being blended into one by these communal creative exercises.
    The (forever) sixteen-year-old Japanese “vocaloid” performer Hatsune Miku (a piece
    of software that performs as a hologram accompanied by a band of living musicians)

    software development; Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most important examples of
    that. But as computing power becomes relevant to much more than just computers,
    the power of interconnected, crowdsourced creation is being spread even further.
    One example that was perhaps a little ahead of its time was the Pink Army Cooperative
    launched by biotechnologist Andrew Hessel in 2009\. Hessel created an open-source
    community of bio-engineers whose mission was to collaboratively work on gene-editing
    software to devise code for a synthetic oncolytic virus to target and kill breast
    cancer cells. The idea was that a global community of experts would bring so much
    more creative power to the objective of finding a pressing medical solution than
    a patent-driven pharmaceutical company could ever hope for—at near-zero cost.

    money to fund this effort, but the open-source collaborative principles behind

    era. That system is decried by consumers of art for the onerous restrictions it
    imposes on creativity. (Documentary filmmakers, for example, are forced to stop
    filming if they hear music in the background, since they don’t want a lawsuit
    from the rights-owning label.) But the DRM system is also often attacked by artists
    themselves, who see so little of the payoff. “I’d prefer that fans got hold of
    the music and shared it because of the love of music rather than be vilified and
    criminalized for doing that,” says Heap.

    of uncontrolled replicability in the digital world, and that’s a problem we may
    now have solved. The outdated idea is that, unlike physical containers of content
    such as books and VHS videos, digital files cannot be treated as unique, isolated
    assets, not when perfect copies can be made at virtually zero cost. But that means
    that, via DRM, the creative industry was shaped by policies that actively restrict,
    rather than promote, widespread use. It also means that our options as consumers
    are, in many ways, more constrained than they were previously. As streaming has
    become the default means of accessing—and monetizing—music and film, we’ve seen
    a deterioration in the quality of the recordings, for example, in order to optimize
    bandwidth usage. That would be fine if consumers could pay more to get higher-quality
    content delivered over different platforms, but they can’t. (This partly explains,
    just as much as does nostalgia and the Brooklyn hipster movement, the resurgent
    popularity of vinyl.)'

    art as a distinct asset. What a blockchain could do, argues Lance Koonce, a lawyer
    from Davis Wright Tremaine, is create a digital version of the “first-sale doctrine,”
    a concept that’s best understood in the context of books. Because both ownership
    and possession of a physical asset are transferred when a sale takes place, secondhand
    booksellers are allowed to resell books at will. The seller can’t hang on to a
    copy for themselves—not without the expensive, time-consuming, low-quality (and
    illegal) work of running the book through a photocopying machine before handing
    it to the buyer. But for e-books and all other digital files, the same problem
    exists that dogged digital currencies in the pre-bitcoin years: the double-spend
    problem. Copying a digital file of text, music, or video has always been trivial.
    Now, with blockchain-based models, Koonce says, “we are seeing systems develop
    that can unequivocally ensure that a particular digital ‘edition’ of a creative
    work is the only one that can be legitimately transferred or sold.” Recall that
    the blockchain, as we explained in chapter three, made the concept of a digital
    asset possible for the first time.'

    digital assets. The technology to copy files won’t go away, regardless of whether
    the first customer obtained the work from an artist who’d registered it in the
    blockchain, and incumbents that make money from the old system won’t give up the
    golden goose quickly. Nonetheless, the mere presence of metadata in an immutable
    structure gives power to artists to manage their creative assets without relying
    on intermediaries such as record labels to handle DRM for them. Users of media
    do want to properly attribute the work of the creator. This could help them do
    that fairly and seamlessly.

    the heavyweights in the creative industries, whose cooperation, to a large extent,
    is still needed. That said, some are exploring these technologies. Among the 170-plus
    members of the Berklee College of Music–sponsored Open Music Initiative you can
    find big labels like Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner
    Music Group, as well as streaming services such as Spotify, Napster, and Netflix.
    The non-profit project’s ability to get these big incumbents to accept new rules,
    however, will depend on how well it lives up to its mission to create “an open-source
    protocol for the uniform identification of music rights holders and creators.”
    Don’t hold your breath on the labels embracing such a thing, however. There’s
    a danger that the Open Music Initiative will become nothing more than a talkfest
    as the incumbent companies use it to forestall change that challenges their ownership
    stake in mountains of old records.

    material, to create an infrastructure of identifiable information about creative
    works, their history, and their creators. That includes figuring out who has rights
    to much of the non-professional, or would-be-professional, content that’s published
    in places such as Facebook and Instagram, Google’s YouTube, Yahoo’s Flickr, and

    busily attaching artists’ metadata—details such as the name of the artist, the
    title of the work, and the date it was produced—to existing digital images on
    the Internet, all in a way that can be stored, registered, and proven in a system
    of decentralized trust. Mediachain has built a giant, distributed, openly accessible
    database of more than 125 million images, all searchable on various fields, including
    descriptors generated by an intelligent image-reading system. Most of these are
    drawn from the rich datapool of works that use Creative Commons licenses in a
    bid to make that system more powerful for creators. “The Creative Commons dataset
    is incredibly fractured across multiple, siloed databases on different platforms,”
    says Mediachain cofounder Jesse Walden. “When your work goes outside of them there
    is no dopamine drip of satisfaction when someone new uses your work or shares
    your work. You don’t get any notifications, any information.” To fix this, Mediachain’s
    distributed data structure is aimed at cutting across all platforms, making each
    image’s metadata accessible and readable to all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mediachain is not, however, using a blockchain for this metadata—not for the
    core registry components, at least. That’s because the current scalability limits
    on public, permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum are especially
    acute for this kind of data. There’s enough of it to fill bitcoin’s 1MB block
    limit for decades to come, and creators have virtually no capacity to pay miners
    the hundreds of millions of dollars in fees that would be needed to ensure their
    information is included and confirmed in blocks. Yet, given the massive, multitudinous,
    and heterogeneous state of the world’s content, with hundreds of millions of would-be
    creators spread all over the world and no way to organize themselves as a common
    interest, there’s likely a need for a permissionless, decentralized system in
    which the data can’t be restricted and manipulated by a centralized institution
    such as a recording studio.

    creating immutable, decentralized repositories for non-financial information,
    has come up with an “off-chain” solution to the data storage problem. It uses
    a hierarchy of verifiable cryptographic links to organize the data in an efficient
    yet verifiable manner and then stores it across the Internet using the IPFS file-management
    system, a new decentralized system for hosting Web sites that spreads files out
    across multiple, participating computers. Mediachain then provides free, open-source
    software with which any user can search the database and that developers can use
    to build new apps. The cryptography keeps the database tamper-proof and reliable
    so long as people trust artists’ assertions about their authorship—as is the case
    for most copyright claims. It’s only when digital assets, or rights to those assets,
    need to be transferred from one owner to another that a blockchain-like consensus
    mechanism is needed.

    commons isn’t disproportionately captured by advertising-driven social media platforms
    like Facebook and professional Web sites like BuzzFeed. Those services can monopolize—and
    therefore monetize—the data they generate on audience behavior within their sites’
    walled gardens. Since most of the images in Mediachain’s collection carry a free-usage
    Creative Commons license, the answer to combatting the monopoly is not to demand
    direct payments from the user that would go to the creator. That would likely
    meet with consumer resistance and kill the very idea of the commons. Rather, the
    focus is on commons-friendly solutions.

- en: One of the Mediachain team’s ideas is a “CC Gratitude” license. Developed with
    the help of lawyer Lance Koonce, this tweaked the Creative Commons license to
    require users to share with the creator information about the locations in which
    they are publishing his or her works. It speaks to Imogen Heap’s desire for artists
    to receive data on their customers’ behavior. Initial responses from the Creative
    Commons foundation weren’t encouraging, however, as there were concerns it would
    require added work, by either end-users or by platforms that would have to build
    systems to automate the function, and thus constrain the natural growth of the
    commons. Those concerns could presumably be ameliorated if platforms like Flickr
    charged artists a small fee to opt in for the service. But in general, says Mediachain’s
    Walden, those big managers “don’t want to share their data into an open, permissionless
    database, in spite of the fact that we are talking about Creative Commons licenses.…
    It’s too disruptive an idea for a platform to impose on itself.” Flickr, in this
    sense, is like so many other centralized providers on the Web—it wants to keep
    people inside its site, not ranging off across the Net to wherever Mediachain
    takes them. This way it generates data that it can sell to advertisers and other
    users. In other words, it is itself in line for disruption by decentralized, blockchain-based
    solutions.

- en: One way that disruption could happen is via an idea that Mediachain has floated
    but hasn’t followed through on. At one stage, Mediachain was about to join the
    token craze, and the company wrote up plans to issue a native cryptocurrency,
    called the CCcoin, for Creative Commons content. The coin would be issued to owners
    of Creative Commons–licensed content if they uploaded their works to Mediachain
    and earned votes from other users for the quality of their work. Think of it as
    a merit-based concept like the group moderation model at social media platform
    Reddit, except that it involved a currency. CCcoin was an experiment with the
    idea of a “proof of creative work,” says Walden. It foresaw a world in which creators
    got some measurable stake attached to their contribution to the commons, while
    those who purchased and used coins could treat it as an act of “benevolent support
    for the public good,” not dissimilar to the motives of those who donate to the
    Creative Commons foundation.
  prefs: []

- en: 'There hasn’t been much follow-through on CCcoin after it was floated in early
    2017\. And that may be because Mediachain’s corporate status has changed—rather
    dramatically. In the spring, it was bought by Spotify, the world’s leading music
    streaming service, which integrated Walden and his team into its New York offices.
    There was one good reason for the deal: in 2016, Spotify had to pay out about
    $20 million to music publishers to settle a lawsuit over unpaid royalties. It
    seems Spotify bought Mediachain as part of its effort to come up with a better
    way to track copyright claims and royalties. In that sense, it’s a validation
    of what Mediachain was trying to do. On the other hand, this could result in a
    private company taking a technology that could have been used publicly, broadly
    for the general good, and hiding it, along with its innovative ideas for tokens
    and other solutions, behind a for-profit wall. Let’s hope it’s not the latter.'
