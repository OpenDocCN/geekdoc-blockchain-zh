    Let’s think about what that means for a particular industry built on the existing
    system of double-entry bookkeeping: accountants. The Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte,
    Price Waterhouse, Ernst Young, and KPMG—seem to be taking an “if-you-can’t-fight-them-join-them”
    approach to the onset of blockchain technology. As of mid-2017, Deloitte alone
    had 250 people working in distributed ledger laboratories, and the other three
    are being similarly aggressive. Of course, these labs occupy a tiny sliver of
    these firms’ massive payrolls, but the dedicated R&D speaks to how seriously the
    companies view the technology. If immutable distributed ledgers become a reality,
    their audit and accounting divisions will eventually become obsolete, with a huge
    human impact. At just under 40 percent of their combined $127 billion in revenues,
    the firms’ audit and assurance divisions directly employ around 300,000 people.'

    audit divisions are just the tip of the accounting business iceberg. It’s not
    just the big-name auditors at risk; it’s every auditor—including companies’ internal
    auditors. In fact, once account-keeping itself becomes fully automated and reconciliation
    functions become superfluous, both those who keep the books and those who audit
    them will be out of work. Machines will input the financial data, analyze the
    financial data, and audit the financial data—all within a few minutes, if not

    start destroying middle-class jobs. In fact, even though a universal basic income
    would, on the surface, run against the classic economic rationalist belief that
    state subsidies disincentivize work, the idea has some support on the right. One
    reason is that a simple, universally distributed transfer of this kind could be

    all sorts of other devices, online marketplaces, and systems to run at the most
    optimal value for all, filling itself up on gas at the best price and deciding
    when, based on the market, to make itself available and when not. The reason why

    can unleash everyone’s inner artist or poet and that, in this way, “each man will
    attain to his perfection”? (That he called this vision “new individualism” spoke
    to Wilde’s unorthodox, anarchistic version of socialism.) In the essay itself,
    the playwright, as if to get ahead of his critics, acknowledged that this notion
    was “unpractical, and it goes against human nature.” But that, he insisted, “is
    why it is worth carrying out.” Well, take a look at how humans behave in the twenty-first-century
    era of social media. It’s hard not to sense that most people with a Twitter account
    want a public voice. And while the “selfie” may not be high art, it’s hard to
    argue that the perpetual pouting and preening on Instagram isn’t a type of performance.
    There is something to the notion that we all want to release our inner creative
    selves. What’s interesting is that this technology is turning creation into a
    more collaborative process. Humor is now “crowdsourced”—think of how memes and
    hashtag jokes evolve, with each new witty version building on the last one. Music,
    brands, and subculture are being blended into one by these communal creative exercises.

    value for everyone. Artists don’t charge people for accessing their works within
    this space, and yet, when the commons works, value feeds back to them in the form
    of more advanced profiles, reputations, or influence. And that gets monetized
    in different ways: musicians attract more people to their concerts, artists get
    commissions, writers get speaking gigs. Or, as average users of Facebook or Twitter,
    we simply enjoy the social capital from having people follow us or like our posts.
    Still, given that so much of the advertising revenue on such platforms is siphoned
    off to those that control them, it’s hard to argue that the commons’ value-generation
    process has been equitable. And in large part that’s because artists have struggled
    to definitively associate themselves with the art they create. They might have
    some visibility over how their works are generating social value within a particular

    and possession of a physical asset are transferred when a sale takes place, secondhand
    booksellers are allowed to resell books at will. The seller can’t hang on to a
    copy for themselves—not without the expensive, time-consuming, low-quality (and
    illegal) work of running the book through a photocopying machine before handing
    it to the buyer. But for e-books and all other digital files, the same problem
    exists that dogged digital currencies in the pre-bitcoin years: the double-spend
    problem. Copying a digital file of text, music, or video has always been trivial.
    Now, with blockchain-based models, Koonce says, “we are seeing systems develop

    a hierarchy of verifiable cryptographic links to organize the data in an efficient
    yet verifiable manner and then stores it across the Internet using the IPFS file-management
    system, a new decentralized system for hosting Web sites that spreads files out
    across multiple, participating computers. Mediachain then provides free, open-source
    software with which any user can search the database and that developers can use
    to build new apps. The cryptography keeps the database tamper-proof and reliable
    so long as people trust artists’ assertions about their authorship—as is the case
    for most copyright claims. It’s only when digital assets, or rights to those assets,
    need to be transferred from one owner to another that a blockchain-like consensus
    mechanism is needed.

    commons isn’t disproportionately captured by advertising-driven social media platforms
    like Facebook and professional Web sites like BuzzFeed. Those services can monopolize—and
    therefore monetize—the data they generate on audience behavior within their sites’
    walled gardens. Since most of the images in Mediachain’s collection carry a free-usage
    Creative Commons license, the answer to combatting the monopoly is not to demand
    direct payments from the user that would go to the creator. That would likely
    meet with consumer resistance and kill the very idea of the commons. Rather, the
    focus is on commons-friendly solutions.

    the help of lawyer Lance Koonce, this tweaked the Creative Commons license to
    require users to share with the creator information about the locations in which
    they are publishing his or her works. It speaks to Imogen Heap’s desire for artists
    to receive data on their customers’ behavior. Initial responses from the Creative
    Commons foundation weren’t encouraging, however, as there were concerns it would
    require added work, by either end-users or by platforms that would have to build
    systems to automate the function, and thus constrain the natural growth of the
    commons. Those concerns could presumably be ameliorated if platforms like Flickr
    charged artists a small fee to opt in for the service. But in general, says Mediachain’s
    Walden, those big managers “don’t want to share their data into an open, permissionless
    database, in spite of the fact that we are talking about Creative Commons licenses.…
    It’s too disruptive an idea for a platform to impose on itself.” Flickr, in this
    sense, is like so many other centralized providers on the Web—it wants to keep
    people inside its site, not ranging off across the Net to wherever Mediachain
    takes them. This way it generates data that it can sell to advertisers and other
    users. In other words, it is itself in line for disruption by decentralized, blockchain-based
    solutions.

    but hasn’t followed through on. At one stage, Mediachain was about to join the
    token craze, and the company wrote up plans to issue a native cryptocurrency,
    called the CCcoin, for Creative Commons content. The coin would be issued to owners
    of Creative Commons–licensed content if they uploaded their works to Mediachain
    and earned votes from other users for the quality of their work. Think of it as
    a merit-based concept like the group moderation model at social media platform
    Reddit, except that it involved a currency. CCcoin was an experiment with the
    idea of a “proof of creative work,” says Walden. It foresaw a world in which creators
    got some measurable stake attached to their contribution to the commons, while
    those who purchased and used coins could treat it as an act of “benevolent support
    for the public good,” not dissimilar to the motives of those who donate to the
    Creative Commons foundation.

    2017\. And that may be because Mediachain’s corporate status has changed—rather
    dramatically. In the spring, it was bought by Spotify, the world’s leading music
    streaming service, which integrated Walden and his team into its New York offices.
    There was one good reason for the deal: in 2016, Spotify had to pay out about
    $20 million to music publishers to settle a lawsuit over unpaid royalties. It
    seems Spotify bought Mediachain as part of its effort to come up with a better
    way to track copyright claims and royalties. In that sense, it’s a validation
    of what Mediachain was trying to do. On the other hand, this could result in a
    private company taking a technology that could have been used publicly, broadly
    for the general good, and hiding it, along with its innovative ideas for tokens
    and other solutions, behind a for-profit wall. Let’s hope it’s not the latter.'

    protect the rights of the Internet’s all-important content producers and creative
    concept developers. But if we are to truly reclaim the Internet for all of us,
    the great mass of humanity that, in our many different ways, provides all of that
    information, entertainment, and ideas, then we also need to think about the governance
    of the Web itself.

    because, at its core, this technology is a governance system. And that, by default,
    makes it a political project—not in the sense that traditional politicians will
    define how the tech develops, though congressmen and law enforcement agents are
    a factor, but in how the stakeholders in this process will set the precepts of
    a program that will rule their lives. Both the question of who writes the algorithms
    and the debate over the external standards and regulations that might constrain
    this technology come down to politics. It’s critical that representatives of all
    interest groups who are destined to be affected have their say in the design of
    blockchain systems and applications. How these different stakeholders work out
    their different priorities is always a matter of politics.
