    Let’s think about what that means for a particular industry built on the existing
    system of double-entry bookkeeping: accountants. The Big Four accounting firms—Deloitte,
    Price Waterhouse, Ernst Young, and KPMG—seem to be taking an “if-you-can’t-fight-them-join-them”
    approach to the onset of blockchain technology. As of mid-2017, Deloitte alone
    had 250 people working in distributed ledger laboratories, and the other three
    are being similarly aggressive. Of course, these labs occupy a tiny sliver of
    these firms’ massive payrolls, but the dedicated R&D speaks to how seriously the
    companies view the technology. If immutable distributed ledgers become a reality,
    their audit and accounting divisions will eventually become obsolete, with a huge
    human impact. At just under 40 percent of their combined $127 billion in revenues,
    the firms’ audit and assurance divisions directly employ around 300,000 people.'

    clients. What will become clear to them is that accounting as we know it—as a
    quarterly exercise in which teams of people review samples of past transactions
    to judge the integrity of past events—will become obsolete. And the Big Four’s
    audit divisions are just the tip of the accounting business iceberg. It’s not
    just the big-name auditors at risk; it’s every auditor—including companies’ internal
    auditors. In fact, once account-keeping itself becomes fully automated and reconciliation
    functions become superfluous, both those who keep the books and those who audit
    them will be out of work. Machines will input the financial data, analyze the
    financial data, and audit the financial data—all within a few minutes, if not

    start destroying middle-class jobs. In fact, even though a universal basic income
    would, on the surface, run against the classic economic rationalist belief that
    state subsidies disincentivize work, the idea has some support on the right. One
    reason is that a simple, universally distributed transfer of this kind could be

    essence, the car would be programmed via smart contracts and interactions with
    all sorts of other devices, online marketplaces, and systems to run at the most
    optimal value for all, filling itself up on gas at the best price and deciding
    when, based on the market, to make itself available and when not. The reason why

    can unleash everyone’s inner artist or poet and that, in this way, “each man will
    attain to his perfection”? (That he called this vision “new individualism” spoke
    to Wilde’s unorthodox, anarchistic version of socialism.) In the essay itself,
    the playwright, as if to get ahead of his critics, acknowledged that this notion
    was “unpractical, and it goes against human nature.” But that, he insisted, “is
    why it is worth carrying out.” Well, take a look at how humans behave in the twenty-first-century
    era of social media. It’s hard not to sense that most people with a Twitter account

    now has, staggeringly, 2 billion users. As legendary cybersecurity expert Bruce
    Schneier has said, “Don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re Facebook’s customer,
    you’re not—you’re the product.” Facebook takes the posts we upload, the media
    we share, the commentary we make, and, most important, the followings we build,
    and packages all of that as a valuable, curated audience to advertisers.'

    Facebook获取我们上传的帖子，我们分享的媒体，我们做出的评论，以及最重要的是我们建立的关注者，并将所有这些打包成有价值的、精选的受众群体提供给广告商。
- en: Facebook’s newsfeed isn’t just a sequential flow of posts, like that of Twitter;
    it’s the product of a proprietary algorithm. With that intelligent, profit-maximizing
    machine making value judgments about who would want to read what, posts gets prioritized
    and delivered to subsets of users that Facebook’s marketing folks describe worryingly
    as “lookalike audiences.” This is how the infamous “echo chambers” of social media,
    those teams of like-minded users with whom we find ourselves unconsciously aligning
    and whose reading lists never include the other side’s point of view, get actively
    created and reinforced. Unknowingly, we all get fed a diet of information that
    affirms our political views. A Wall Street Journal report titled “Blue Feed, Red
    Feed” showed just how different Facebook’s politically defined feeds have become.

    But it’s a fabulous environment for advertisers. They now get to work with a clearly
    defined audience and can benefit from the networking effect and reinforcing power
    of its members’ “likes” and “shares” on a piece of content. This setup means that
    articles that are intended to get a rise (which manifests as “likes” or “shares”)
    can be quite literally made up out of nothing, deposited into this echo chamber,
    and used to steer valuable eyeballs back to their original sites in return for
    native advertising or Google Ad dollars. Think of what that means for The New
    York Times or The Wall Street Journal or other serious news outlets that also
    strive to use Facebook’s powerful platform to attract audiences back to their
    own ad-bearing sites. Those news outlets spend hundreds of millions of dollars
    on newsrooms, bureaus, lawyers, and all manner of infrastructure to make sure
    they get the story right. Yet here they are having to compete, with an inferior
    ability to build an echo-chamber audience, with fake news providers such as those
    teenagers in Macedonia who, during the 2016 election, successfully fed conservative
    “lookalike audiences” stories such as the one saying that Pope Francis had “forbidden”
    Catholics from voting for Hillary Clinton.

    Google 广告收入。想想看，这对《纽约时报》、《华尔街日报》或其他也力求利用 Facebook 强大平台吸引受众回到自己的带广告的网站的严肃新闻媒体意味着什么。这些新闻媒体在新闻编辑部、分社、律师和各种基础设施上花费了数亿美元，以确保他们报道准确无误。然而，他们不得不与那些能力较差的建立回声室受众的假新闻提供者竞争，比如在

- en: 'Nor would cutting off the free usage of your content necessarily be in your
    interest. One of the magical things of the open, sharing nature of the Internet
    is that it has created value by building audiences and connections. This is the
    notion of the online “commons,” an open-access space of communication that generates
    value for everyone. Artists don’t charge people for accessing their works within
    this space, and yet, when the commons works, value feeds back to them in the form
    of more advanced profiles, reputations, or influence. And that gets monetized
    in different ways: musicians attract more people to their concerts, artists get
    commissions, writers get speaking gigs. Or, as average users of Facebook or Twitter,
    we simply enjoy the social capital from having people follow us or like our posts.
    Still, given that so much of the advertising revenue on such platforms is siphoned
    off to those that control them, it’s hard to argue that the commons’ value-generation
    process has been equitable. And in large part that’s because artists have struggled
    to definitively associate themselves with the art they create. They might have
    some visibility over how their works are generating social value within a particular
    platform—by viewing how many likes they get on Facebook, for example—but once
    it is copied and shared across platforms, the connection is broken.'

  zh: 切断你内容的免费使用也不一定符合你的利益。互联网开放共享的神奇之一在于它通过建立受众和联系创造了价值。这就是在线“共享空间”的概念，一个为每个人创造价值的开放式交流空间。艺术家们不会向人们收费以在这个空间内访问他们的作品，然而，当共享空间发挥作用时，价值以更加先进的个人资料、声望或影响力的形式反馈给他们。这以不同的方式实现了商业化：音乐家吸引更多人参加他们的音乐会，艺术家获得委托作品，作家得到演讲机会。或者，作为Facebook或Twitter的普通用户，我们简单地享受着有人关注我们或点赞我们的帖子所带来的社交资本。然而，考虑到这些平台上的广告收入很大一部分被掌控这些平台的人独吞，很难说共享空间的价值生成过程是公平的。在很大程度上，这是因为艺术家们一直在努力将自己与他们创造的艺术作品明确地联系起来。他们可能对他们的作品在特定平台上生成的社会价值有一些可见度——例如，在Facebook上获得了多少赞，但一旦它被复制并在各个平台上分享，这种联系就会中断。
- en: The ingenious Creative Commons license is helping bring some fairness to the
    reuse of art and photos, creating a legal structure that explicitly licenses various
    forms of free use so long as there is compliance with certain conditions. Based
    on a series of categories of the license, these conditions specify what kind of
    attribution is required, for example, or whether the work is to be used for commercial
    purposes. Today, there are well over a billion works licensed under the Creative
    Commons system, most residing on publishing platforms such as Flickr and Wikimedia.
    Yet so much more could be done to empower artists and enrich their relationships
    with consumers. In all creative industries, but especially music, this lack of
    empowerment results in continued exploitation by the intermediaries that monopolize
    distribution and marketing of artistic material and that, in return for their
    services, claim contractual “rights” over it. The commons is still far from the

    booksellers are allowed to resell books at will. The seller can’t hang on to a

    is still needed. That said, some are exploring these technologies. Among the 170-plus
    members of the Berklee College of Music–sponsored Open Music Initiative you can
    find big labels like Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner
    Music Group, as well as streaming services such as Spotify, Napster, and Netflix.
    The non-profit project’s ability to get these big incumbents to accept new rules,
    however, will depend on how well it lives up to its mission to create “an open-source
    protocol for the uniform identification of music rights holders and creators.”
    Don’t hold your breath on the labels embracing such a thing, however. There’s
    a danger that the Open Music Initiative will become nothing more than a talkfest
    as the incumbent companies use it to forestall change that challenges their ownership
    stake in mountains of old records.

    way to give order and enforceable claims to a great swath of already-published
    material, to create an infrastructure of identifiable information about creative
    works, their history, and their creators. That includes figuring out who has rights

    in places such as Facebook and Instagram, Google’s YouTube, Yahoo’s Flickr, and

- en: Still, the process has to start somewhere. Brooklyn-based Mediachain has been
    busily attaching artists’ metadata—details such as the name of the artist, the
    title of the work, and the date it was produced—to existing digital images on
    the Internet, all in a way that can be stored, registered, and proven in a system
    of decentralized trust. Mediachain has built a giant, distributed, openly accessible
    database of more than 125 million images, all searchable on various fields, including
    descriptors generated by an intelligent image-reading system. Most of these are
    drawn from the rich datapool of works that use Creative Commons licenses in a
    bid to make that system more powerful for creators. “The Creative Commons dataset
    is incredibly fractured across multiple, siloed databases on different platforms,”
    says Mediachain cofounder Jesse Walden. “When your work goes outside of them there
    is no dopamine drip of satisfaction when someone new uses your work or shares
    your work. You don’t get any notifications, any information.” To fix this, Mediachain’s
    distributed data structure is aimed at cutting across all platforms, making each
    image’s metadata accessible and readable to all.

  zh: 然而，这个过程必须从某个地方开始。总部位于布鲁克林的Mediachain一直在忙于将艺术家的元数据（例如艺术家的姓名、作品的标题和制作日期）附加到互联网上现有的数字图像中，以一种可以在去中心化信任系统中存储、注册和验证的方式。Mediachain已经建立了一个庞大的、分布式的、可公开访问的数据库，其中包含超过1.25亿张图像，所有这些图像都可以通过各种字段进行搜索，包括由智能图像阅读系统生成的描述符。其中大部分来自使用创作共用许可证的作品的丰富数据池，旨在为创作者提供更强大的系统。Mediachain联合创始人杰西·沃尔登说：“创作共用数据集在不同平台上的多个分裂数据库中是非常分散的。”
    “当你的作品走出这些平台时，没有任何新用户使用你的作品或分享你的作品时的多巴胺滴感到满足。你不会收到任何通知，也不会得到任何信息。” 为了解决这个问题，Mediachain的分布式数据结构旨在跨越所有平台，使每个图像的元数据对所有人都可以访问和阅读。
- en: Mediachain is not, however, using a blockchain for this metadata—not for the
    core registry components, at least. That’s because the current scalability limits
    on public, permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum are especially
    acute for this kind of data. There’s enough of it to fill bitcoin’s 1MB block
    limit for decades to come, and creators have virtually no capacity to pay miners
    the hundreds of millions of dollars in fees that would be needed to ensure their
    information is included and confirmed in blocks. Yet, given the massive, multitudinous,
    and heterogeneous state of the world’s content, with hundreds of millions of would-be
    creators spread all over the world and no way to organize themselves as a common
    interest, there’s likely a need for a permissionless, decentralized system in
    which the data can’t be restricted and manipulated by a centralized institution
    such as a recording studio.

  zh: Mediachain并不是在这个元数据上使用区块链——至少不是用于核心注册组件。这是因为目前公开、无需许可的区块链（如比特币或以太坊）在这种数据上的可扩展性限制尤为严重。这种数据足以填满比特币的1MB区块限制数十年，并且创作者几乎没有能力支付数亿美元的手续费，以确保他们的信息被包含在区块中并得到确认。然而，考虑到世界内容的庞大、多样和异质化状态，全球数亿潜在创作者分布在世界各地，没有办法组织成共同利益，很可能需要一个无需许可的、去中心化的系统，其中数据不能受到类似录音工作室等中央机构的限制和操纵。
- en: In response, Mediachain, like other players across various industries that are
    creating immutable, decentralized repositories for non-financial information,
    has come up with an “off-chain” solution to the data storage problem. It uses
    a hierarchy of verifiable cryptographic links to organize the data in an efficient
    yet verifiable manner and then stores it across the Internet using the IPFS file-management
    system, a new decentralized system for hosting Web sites that spreads files out
    across multiple, participating computers. Mediachain then provides free, open-source
    software with which any user can search the database and that developers can use
    to build new apps. The cryptography keeps the database tamper-proof and reliable
    so long as people trust artists’ assertions about their authorship—as is the case
    for most copyright claims. It’s only when digital assets, or rights to those assets,
    need to be transferred from one owner to another that a blockchain-like consensus
    mechanism is needed.

  zh: 作为回应，Mediachain像其他各行业的参与者一样，为非金融信息创建不可变、去中心化的存储库，提出了一个针对数据存储问题的“离链”解决方案。它使用可验证的加密链接层次结构以高效且可验证的方式组织数据，然后使用IPFS文件管理系统在互联网上存储数据，这是一种用于托管网站的新型去中心化系统，可以将文件分布在多个参与计算机上。然后Mediachain提供免费的开源软件，任何用户都可以使用该软件搜索数据库，开发人员可以使用该软件构建新的应用程序。只要人们信任艺术家对其作品权的声明（正如大多数版权声明的情况），加密技术就可以保持数据库防篡改和可靠。只有当数字资产或这些资产的权利需要从一个所有者转移到另一个所有者时，才需要类似区块链的共识机制。
- en: The end goal is to fix the “broken loop” so that the value generated in the
    commons isn’t disproportionately captured by advertising-driven social media platforms
    like Facebook and professional Web sites like BuzzFeed. Those services can monopolize—and
    therefore monetize—the data they generate on audience behavior within their sites’
    walled gardens. Since most of the images in Mediachain’s collection carry a free-usage
    Creative Commons license, the answer to combatting the monopoly is not to demand
    direct payments from the user that would go to the creator. That would likely
    meet with consumer resistance and kill the very idea of the commons. Rather, the
    focus is on commons-friendly solutions.

- en: One of the Mediachain team’s ideas is a “CC Gratitude” license. Developed with
    the help of lawyer Lance Koonce, this tweaked the Creative Commons license to
    require users to share with the creator information about the locations in which
    they are publishing his or her works. It speaks to Imogen Heap’s desire for artists
    to receive data on their customers’ behavior. Initial responses from the Creative
    Commons foundation weren’t encouraging, however, as there were concerns it would
    require added work, by either end-users or by platforms that would have to build
    systems to automate the function, and thus constrain the natural growth of the
    commons. Those concerns could presumably be ameliorated if platforms like Flickr
    charged artists a small fee to opt in for the service. But in general, says Mediachain’s
    Walden, those big managers “don’t want to share their data into an open, permissionless
    database, in spite of the fact that we are talking about Creative Commons licenses.…
    It’s too disruptive an idea for a platform to impose on itself.” Flickr, in this
    sense, is like so many other centralized providers on the Web—it wants to keep
    people inside its site, not ranging off across the Net to wherever Mediachain
    takes them. This way it generates data that it can sell to advertisers and other
    users. In other words, it is itself in line for disruption by decentralized, blockchain-based
    solutions.

  zh: Mediachain团队的一个想法是“CC Gratitude”许可证。在律师Lance Koonce的帮助下开发了这个许可证，将创意共享许可证进行了微调，要求用户与创作者分享他们发布作品的位置信息。这满足了Imogen
    Heap希望艺术家能收到有关客户行为的数据的愿望。然而，来自创意共享基金会的初步反应并不令人鼓舞，因为他们担心这将需要额外的工作，无论是最终用户还是必须构建系统自动化功能的平台，从而限制了共享空间的自然增长。如果像Flickr这样的平台向艺术家收取一小笔费用来选择使用该服务，那么这些担忧可能会得到缓解。但总的来说，Mediachain的Walden说，这些大型管理者“不愿意将他们的数据分享到一个开放的、无需许可的数据库中，尽管我们在谈论创意共享许可证……这对平台来说是一个太过颠覆性的想法，无法自行施加。”从这个意义上说，Flickr就像Web上许多其他中心化的提供者一样——它希望将人们留在其网站内，而不是在Mediachain带领他们的网站上漫游。这样它就能生成可以出售给广告商和其他用户的数据。换句话说，它本身也将面临分散的、基于区块链的解决方案的颠覆。
- en: One way that disruption could happen is via an idea that Mediachain has floated
    but hasn’t followed through on. At one stage, Mediachain was about to join the
    token craze, and the company wrote up plans to issue a native cryptocurrency,
    called the CCcoin, for Creative Commons content. The coin would be issued to owners
    of Creative Commons–licensed content if they uploaded their works to Mediachain
    and earned votes from other users for the quality of their work. Think of it as
    a merit-based concept like the group moderation model at social media platform
    Reddit, except that it involved a currency. CCcoin was an experiment with the
    idea of a “proof of creative work,” says Walden. It foresaw a world in which creators
    got some measurable stake attached to their contribution to the commons, while
    those who purchased and used coins could treat it as an act of “benevolent support
    for the public good,” not dissimilar to the motives of those who donate to the
    Creative Commons foundation.

  zh: 破坏可能发生的一种方式是通过 Mediachain 提出但尚未实施的想法。在某个阶段，Mediachain 差点加入了代币热潮，该公司起草了发行一种名为
    CCcoin 的本地加密货币的计划，用于 Creative Commons 内容。如果所有者将其作品上传到 Mediachain 并从其他用户那里获得了对其作品质量的投票，那么这枚硬币将发给
    Creative Commons 许可的内容所有者。将其视为一种基于功绩的概念，类似于社交媒体平台 Reddit 上的群体管理模式，只是这牵涉到一种货币。CCcoin
    是对“创意作品证明”的实验，沃尔登说。它预见到一个世界，在这个世界中，创作者对他们对共同体的贡献有一些可衡量的利益，而购买和使用硬币的人可以将其视为对公共利益的“善意支持”的行为，与那些向
    Creative Commons 基金会捐款的人的动机并没有太大差异。
- en: 'There hasn’t been much follow-through on CCcoin after it was floated in early
    2017\. And that may be because Mediachain’s corporate status has changed—rather
    dramatically. In the spring, it was bought by Spotify, the world’s leading music
    streaming service, which integrated Walden and his team into its New York offices.
    There was one good reason for the deal: in 2016, Spotify had to pay out about
    $20 million to music publishers to settle a lawsuit over unpaid royalties. It
    seems Spotify bought Mediachain as part of its effort to come up with a better
    way to track copyright claims and royalties. In that sense, it’s a validation
    of what Mediachain was trying to do. On the other hand, this could result in a
    private company taking a technology that could have been used publicly, broadly
    for the general good, and hiding it, along with its innovative ideas for tokens
    and other solutions, behind a for-profit wall. Let’s hope it’s not the latter.'

    Spotify 收购，并将沃尔登及其团队整合到其纽约办事处。这笔交易有一个很好的理由：2016 年，Spotify 不得不支付约 2000 万美元给音乐出版商，以解决一起未支付版税的诉讼。看起来
    Spotify 收购 Mediachain 是为了找到一种更好的方式来跟踪版权索赔和版税。从这个意义上说，这是对 Mediachain 尝试的做法的验证。另一方面，这可能导致一家私营公司拿走了原本可以被广泛用于公共利益的技术，并将其与创新的代币和其他解决方案一起隐藏在以盈利为目的的墙后。让我们希望它不是后者。
