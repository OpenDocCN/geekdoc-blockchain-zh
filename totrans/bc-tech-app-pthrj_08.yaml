    of the hardware and the software (operating systems). Thus it started with the
    applications that worked on independent computers whose benefits restricted to
    the users of that computer, distributed applications that delivered useful services
    to large number of clients with client/server architecture. Then with the introduction
    of web services the scenario changed from the tightly coupled application to that
    of the loosely coupled application. The loosely coupled application in the service-oriented
    architecture did not share the transaction and did not trust each other but relied
    on some centralized control.

    peer to peer transaction in the decentralized network by establishing trust among
    unknown peers placed its position with the enablement of a new world of opportunities
    introduced with the concept of blockchain. Blockchain has given more integrity
    and independence to various applications by introducing the permissionless protocol
    and smart contract. The loosely coupled application has an improved form of automatic

    ledger that can note the transactions between two parties efficiently and in a
    verifiable and permanent way. Mining solves puzzles to add transaction records
    to the public ledger of past transactions. The ledger of past transactions is

    to each other work together by sharing the data in the form of a public ledger.
    The data could be historical information of transactions like bank transactions
    that will be available to everyone for future computation. The public ledger ensures
    consistency which is nothing but that the local copies ([Figure 9.1](chapter9.xhtml#fig9.1))

    the block can be added to the shared ledger. The blockchain adds a nonce (number
    only used once) generated by the miners in the block which is a pseudorandom number
    that cannot be reused in replay attacks due to which the hashed or rehashed block
    meets the difficulty level of restrictions. The miners try to solve the puzzle
    to identify the nonce in the last block. The nodes accumulate the verified transactions
    in a block and use the computation power to find a value that makes the SHA-256
    hash value of this block less than a dynamically varying target value. The header
    of the block includes the arbitrary nonce, the hash of the previous block, the
    Merkle root hash of the listed transactions, the timestamp and the block version.
    The hash of all the hashes of the transactions in a block is called the Merkle
    root. Every leaf node is the hash of the data block and the non-leaf node is the
    cryptographic hash of its child nodes. This is used in Bitcoin.

    wireless sensors, called Taps, that allow communication with computers, phones,
    or tablets within 10 miles (bit.ly/2rsxZYf). Taps create low-power, autonomous
    mesh networks that enable companies to manage physical mining operations or water
    flows over agricultural fields. Taps don’t rely on cloud services. Device identification
    and intercommunication is secured by a blockchain that holds the unique identity
    of each participating node.

    You cannot exchange values. However, moving assets among ledgers leads to convenience.
    Consumers are increasingly interested in exchanging information between blockchains.
    Linking activities with different chains makes sense. For example, an institution
    can request the arrival of funds in the blockchain to make appropriate transfers
    of funds to others. In fact, there are a number of connectors that facilitate
    payments between these ledgers, and there are major obstacles to introducing new

    work together while maintaining their protective properties. Many independent
    block networks are called zones. These areas are powered by a highly efficient,
    consistent and safe consensus engine. The first area of the cosmos is the center
    of the network. This acts as the government of the entire system, which allows
    the network to adapt and modernize. In addition, hubs can be extended by connecting
    other zones. Zones provide future compatibility with the new blockchain because
    each blockchain system can connect to the Cosmos hub. It can also isolate everyone
    from the failure of other regions. Cosmos allows blockchain communication through
    protocols, such as some kind of UDP or virtual TCP. Coupons can be safely and
    quickly transferred from one zone to another without having to exchange liquidity
    between zones. To monitor the total number of tokens held by zones, all tokens
    go through the Cosmos Hub.

    must be parallel to the parachains. Each parachains is operated by another segment

    with the ability to be blockchain protocol that are compatible with heterogeneous
    block systems that interact by creating dynamic block networks called router blockchains.
    The router blockchain contains a number of router nodes. Chains join a blockchain
    network before the node becomes the routing node that is a member of the router
    block. All routing nodes with details about different circuits become blockchain
    systems that support router information. After the router information is updated,
    all router nodes match the latest routing table. In this way, the router blockchain
    system records validated addresses from each participating blockchain. When a
    transaction is generated between circuit A and circuit B, circuit A can be connected
    to circuit B, the data sent correspond to routing information written in the router
    blockchain.
