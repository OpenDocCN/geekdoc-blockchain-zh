- en: In late 2008, under the long shadow cast by the most severe economic crisis
    in generations, a revolutionary new form of currency was quietly being shaped.
    Initially, there was no clue that an obscure form of electronic money would prove
    to be the most important financial innovation of the 21st century, a tool that
    would soon be widely adopted by people, economies, and companies all across the
    world. In October of that year, in a white paper issued by an anonymous person
    or group calling itself Satoshi Nakamoto—now known to the world as “the creator
    of Bitcoin”—the digital currency known as Bitcoin, and the technologies underpinning
    it, were laid out for the first time. There were few clues in this initial description
    that made anyone think Bitcoin had the power to upend and revolutionize the world’s
    financial system. Bitcoin’s success was far from assured.

    Nakamoto）——现在全世界都知道它是“比特币的创造者”——发布了一份白皮书，首次阐述了后来被称为比特币的数字货币及其背后的技术。这个最初的描述中没有提供任何线索，让人认为比特币有力量颠覆和革命化世界金融系统。比特币的成功并非十拿九稳。
- en: In its early days, Bitcoin was mostly seen as an oddity—something that was only
    around to amuse experts in cryptography. Just ten years ago, the general public
    was still mostly unfamiliar with cryptocurrency. It was only for specialists and
    eccentrics. Today, of course, Bitcoin has become a household name. It has the
    highest market value of any cryptocurrency. Moreover, it has drawn an enormous
    amount of attention to blockchain, the technology on which it is built. (If you’ve
    ever been to a blockchain conference, you will truly feel the “electricity in
    the air” of the great expectations people now hold for the future of blockchain
    technology. Bitcoin has had its ups and downs, but this enthusiasm has not abated.)
    Blockchain was originally developed as a sort of “storage room” for Bitcoin—something
    that would record transactions and avoid the possibility of the currency being
    used inappropriately. The focus of this book will be the technical backbone of
    cryptocurrency and the crypto economies it makes possible. But before we get into
    the thick of it, we need to spend a moment on Bitcoin and its history, because
    Bitcoin was the driver of it all. It’s just that important.

    into this environment, Bitcoin arrived like a magic bullet, seemingly designed
    to solve the very issues that had caused the financial crisis in the first place.

    from your neighbor—which puts you in his debt but allows you to pay him in the
    future. You can also simply pay him for the wood blocks in cash, which he can

    roles in the financial system by managing how much money is released into the
    market, and controlling when this release happens. This is true for fiat money,
    and also for traditional digital money. In order to be accepted as a legitimate
    currency, digital money needs to represent value and be able to carry value. As
    I mentioned earlier, digital money is merely another form of fiat money. It is,
    essentially, the same thing. It relies on a trusted third party to verify every
    transaction. Cryptocurrency, however, has no need for a third party. Another way
    to put this is that it cuts out the middleman. Cryptocurrencies are also different

    users have to contribute computer power to the blockchain to achieve a consensus.
    Transactions are then documented into blocks spread across the entire chain. One
    way to think of this is that blockchain allows a permanent record to be kept of
    each Bitcoin transaction and eliminates the possibility of so-called double payments.
    Blockchain is essential to Bitcoin and is what allows for the cryptocurrency’s

- en: It’s been a decade since Satoshi laid down his vision for Bitcoin and Blockchain.
    From the early days of cypherpunks and tech nerds circulating a trendy new currency
    for insiders only, cryptocurrencies are now empowering the general public by providing
    a new way of participating in and conducting transactions. It may take a while
    for any cryptocurrency to rival traditional currency, but the idea is no longer
    science fiction. It could actually happen within our lifetimes. And if it does,
    we will realize new efficiencies in all kinds of transactions by undercutting
    third parties, creating fewer transaction costs, saving time, enjoying better
    security and safety, and preserving near-total anonymity.

  zh: 自从中本聪为比特币和区块链设定愿景以来已经过去了十年。从密码朋克和技术宅早期只在内部人士之间流通一种时髦的新货币，加密货币现在通过提供一种新的参与和进行交易的方式，正在赋予公众权力。任何加密货币要想与传统货币相匹敌可能还需要一段时间，但这个想法已经不再是科幻小说了。实际上，它可能会在我们的有生之年实现。如果真的实现了，我们通过绕过第三方、降低交易成本、节省时间、获得更好的安全和安全性以及保持几乎完全匿名，将在各种交易中实现新的效率。
