- en: In late 2008, under the long shadow cast by the most severe economic crisis
    in generations, a revolutionary new form of currency was quietly being shaped.
    Initially, there was no clue that an obscure form of electronic money would prove
    to be the most important financial innovation of the 21st century, a tool that
    would soon be widely adopted by people, economies, and companies all across the
    world. In October of that year, in a white paper issued by an anonymous person
    or group calling itself Satoshi Nakamoto—now known to the world as “the creator
    of Bitcoin”—the digital currency known as Bitcoin, and the technologies underpinning
    it, were laid out for the first time. There were few clues in this initial description
    that made anyone think Bitcoin had the power to upend and revolutionize the world’s
    financial system. Bitcoin’s success was far from assured.

    around to amuse experts in cryptography. Just ten years ago, the general public
    was still mostly unfamiliar with cryptocurrency. It was only for specialists and
    eccentrics. Today, of course, Bitcoin has become a household name. It has the
    highest market value of any cryptocurrency. Moreover, it has drawn an enormous
    amount of attention to blockchain, the technology on which it is built. (If you’ve
    ever been to a blockchain conference, you will truly feel the “electricity in
    the air” of the great expectations people now hold for the future of blockchain
    technology. Bitcoin has had its ups and downs, but this enthusiasm has not abated.)
    Blockchain was originally developed as a sort of “storage room” for Bitcoin—something
    that would record transactions and avoid the possibility of the currency being
    used inappropriately. The focus of this book will be the technical backbone of
    cryptocurrency and the crypto economies it makes possible. But before we get into
    the thick of it, we need to spend a moment on Bitcoin and its history, because
    Bitcoin was the driver of it all. It’s just that important.

    in banks, governments, and other powerful institutions. Suddenly, everything was
    in doubt. Entities that had been seen as rock-solid and trustworthy for generations
    appeared to have abruptly let us down. They had been revealed as empty facades.
    The emperors had no clothes. Now, the world was looking for new solutions. And
    into this environment, Bitcoin arrived like a magic bullet, seemingly designed
    to solve the very issues that had caused the financial crisis in the first place.
    Bitcoin would decentralize power. There would be no external arbiter or regulator
    that might fail us. To the contrary, the people—the users of the cryptocurrency
    themselves—would truly hold the power.

    at just the right time. One must admit that it also has a sense of mystery about
    it, an allure that many found romantic and daring. Bitcoin was exclusive at first,
    like a club that people wanted to join. It was initially introduced to a very
    small group of people—experts in cryptography and “tech nerds” who were obsessed
    with the concept of individual liberty. (Some called these people “cypherpunks.”)
    Just as one sees in the trajectory of any exclusive brand, Bitcoin gradually made
    itself more available to the masses. Yet even as consumers scrambled to get in
    on the hip, new “Bitcoin rush,” many did not truly understand what the currency
    was, and the transformative power it held. But for us to discuss that here, we
    need to take a brief look at the history of money.

    year 3000 BC. Sumerians are generally understood to be the first people who used
    money as a medium to facilitate exchange. Before the Sumerians, humans mostly
    used a barter system to make exchanges—trading things for other physical things.
    There are many disadvantages to a barter system.

    one sheep for twenty wood blocks. You give him your sheep, and he gives you his
    blocks. Sure, it works, but it’s not as easy as using money.

    kinds of inefficiencies and issues. If you don’t have anything your neighbor wants,
    for example, then a trade cannot happen. As a way around these issues, we invented
    money and credit, which remain the foundations of our economy today. Today, if
    you want wood blocks, you can use credit or debt to borrow twenty wood blocks
    from your neighbor—which puts you in his debt but allows you to pay him in the
    future. You can also simply pay him for the wood blocks in cash, which he can
    then spend any way he likes. Either works if your neighbor trusts you and/or trusts
    the currency you give him. Credit and money enable trade and make it more efficient.

    has become an inextricable part of our lives. Many of us can live without our

    our economic transactions. Companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and IBM
    have all—in different ways—become part of the apparatus we trust to provide safety
    online. The information we use is stored in central servers owned by powerful
    Internet companies. These companies provide services we value, and in return we
    trust them with our personal information. Yet once our information is in their
    hands, we have very little control over how they may use or exploit it. Think
    of how frequently we learn that a web company has been selling user information
    without permission. Think of how frequently websites change their terms of service,
    allowing customer data to be sold or used in other ways. Facebook’s recent scandal

    You’re charged a special rate to use your credit card in another country. Some
    cards are not accepted at all in certain countries. And middlemen—such as banks
    and finance companies—play major roles in the transactions. PayPal and Ali Pay
    likewise present themselves as “trusted third-party payment options,” yet their

    “Crypto Credits.” David Chaum was the first to apply cryptography to E-cash. Yet
    one of the major issues that E-cash faced was called “Double Spend.” This, more
    or less, is what it sounds like. Money is spent twice. Transactions are redeemed
    twice. It’s like taking a check to one bank and cashing it, and then being able
    to take it to another bank and cash it again. For example, say that the User A
    issues $1 in E-cash through an E-signature to User B. The risk is that User B
    will then duplicate User A’s E-signature to get two dollars instead of one.

    a unique serial number on each note issued. When the note was sent out from User
    A, User B would check the signature and make a phone call to User A, asking him
    or her for the serial number, and if the E-cash note had been used previously.
    If the note had not been cashed before, User B would accept the note. User A would
    then document that the note had been used.

    known as “Blind Signature,” which basically solves two problems at once—anonymity
    and double spend. It allows the user to perform any monetary exchange that actual,
    physical money would allow (except perhaps physically flipping coins). How does
    Blind Signature work? It all takes place in an “envelope.” User A puts a note
    with a serial number into the “envelope,” which no one has access to except for
    User A. But then how does User B sign the note without his or her identity becoming
    known? The answer is to insert a carbon paper into the “envelope”—the signature
    will then appear on the note through the carbon paper. However, User B doesn’t
    know the serial number, and User A doesn’t know who signed the note.

    roles in the financial system by managing how much money is released into the
    market, and controlling when this release happens. This is true for fiat money,
    and also for traditional digital money. In order to be accepted as a legitimate
    currency, digital money needs to represent value and be able to carry value. As
    I mentioned earlier, digital money is merely another form of fiat money. It is,
    essentially, the same thing. It relies on a trusted third party to verify every
    transaction. Cryptocurrency, however, has no need for a third party. Another way
    to put this is that it cuts out the middleman. Cryptocurrencies are also different

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A person making transactions with Bitcoin uses an electronic wallet, which has
    an IP address containing that person’s public “key” and other identification.
    It is this wallet that allows the person to send and receive Bitcoins, and to
    document each transaction. Beside the public key, the Bitcoin user also has her
    or his own private key to which only they have access. This double encryption
    helps users of Bitcoin to remain anonymous. In order to verify a Bitcoin transaction,
    users have to contribute computer power to the blockchain to achieve a consensus.
    Transactions are then documented into blocks spread across the entire chain. One
    way to think of this is that blockchain allows a permanent record to be kept of
    each Bitcoin transaction and eliminates the possibility of so-called double payments.
    Blockchain is essential to Bitcoin and is what allows for the cryptocurrency’s
    decentralization and disintermediation. Each block in the chain nests information
    that cannot be altered. Trust is created by the technology itself and the way
    it provides total transparency.

    the front of the chain. With this Hash Pointer in place, it is impossible to hack
    the blockchain. Once a block is created and accepted, it is almost impossible
    to alter. At a primordial, technical level, this means the blocks and the transactions
    they record are virtually inalterable.

  prefs: []

    cryptography gives every user two keys, a public key and a private key. The public
    key presents the identification and the IP address of the account holder. It can
    also encrypt information. Whatever information the public key encrypts can only
    be decoded by the matching private key. If a user is using a private key to sign
    any information, only the matching public key can verify the authenticity of the
    signature. In this world of decentralization, there is no need for a centralized
    power—like a bank, or software company, or government entity—to manage or secure
    any user’s information. Users open their accounts and keep their private key.
    Bitcoin users (and users of any other cryptocurrencies) often use the word address
    to refer to the Hash Value of the public key. The private key stays in the control
    of each user. In this way, asymmetric cryptography cuts out the government and
    any other entities who, in the physical world, collect and manage our identification
    information to verify transactions.

    coordinated attack or make a coordinated retreat. (The consequences of half of

    junk email a headache because they had to put work into meeting the standard in

    box. But since not many people used email back in 1996 (at least not compared
    to now), the issue of junk spam email didn’t get the attention it gets today.

- en: From an economical point of view, Proof of Work increases the cost of inputting
    false information. To release a block into the chain of a blockchain takes a considerable
    amount of computer power. Being the first one to release a block into the system
    can be very time- and energy-intensive. When you hear about miners “mining Bitcoins,”
    they are actually creating new blocks or verifying new transactions in the chain.
    The Bitcoin blockchain accordingly rewards these miners through Proof of Work
    for their efforts.

    it is the same in the world of Bitcoin, where miners have to prove their work
    through Hash Function. In addition to being a long process, it’s also a very complicated
    process. Miners need to solve all kinds of mathematical problems. The result of
    successfully solving those problems is receiving Bitcoins. Whenever a new block
    in a blockchain is created, the miner will be rewarded with a certain amount of
    Bitcoins. And when a new piece of transaction is put into blocks, then the miner
    will be rewarded with a certain amount of Bitcoins depending on who initiated
    the transaction.

- en: Proof of Work runs in a space where there is no need for “trust” in the traditional
    sense, because everything is verified by the system. As long as you get your work
    done, you will be rewarded. It’s almost impossible to cheat in this process. There
    are many types of cryptocurrencies currently using Proof of Work to validate transactions
    and create new blocks, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Monero.

    the system more solid and safer, yet at the same time, more energy will be consumed.
    This vicious cycle of energy consumption puts Proof of Work in an environmentally
    unfriendly situation. Thus, many seek viable alternatives to it. In this connection,
    Proof of Stake has emerged as another very popular way of reaching distributed
    consensus.

    of input. Put in simple English, this approach can be summarized as “the rich
    get richer.” Under Proof of Stake, the more Bitcoins you possess, the better the
    chance you are going to be assigned to solve the block. In Proof of Stake, miners
    are called validators. Validators need to deposit a certain amount of cryptocoins
    to start with. The more they deposit, the better chance they have to solve the
    new block. Proof of Stake does not need as much as electricity as traditional
    mining, and it’s catching on. For example, Ethereum recently switched from Proof
    of Work to Proof of Stake.

- en: I’ve never been to Yap, an island in Micronesia, but I’ve heard that the money
    there is unique. Islanders on Yap use discs made from limestone as currency. If
    a disc is too big to move around—as many are—the owner has only to make a mark
    on that stone to indicate it has been used to settle a transaction. This is actually
    a somewhat similar concept to Bitcoin, at least in terms of how each transaction
    is documented.

- en: Marking on a Yap stone disc is not much different from keeping transaction information
    preserved in a blockchain. The exchange information for Bitcoins (and other cryptocurrencies)
    is not kept in one central server. Rather, every transaction is documented in
    each block of a chain. The blockchain spreads out and runs on millions of computers,
    which makes it hard for anyone to hack, since it is not being kept on any single
    large database. Rather, the information is everywhere, all at the same time. In
    this way, blockchain is open and accessible to everyone in the Internet at any
    time. Privacy—at least in terms of spending and receiving money—is protected by
    use of the public and private keys. So Bitcoin is the asset of choice for the
    Internet, and the blockchain is the backbone protecting it by documenting and
    securing every single transaction.

    From the early days of cypherpunks and tech nerds circulating a trendy new currency
    for insiders only, cryptocurrencies are now empowering the general public by providing
    a new way of participating in and conducting transactions. It may take a while
    for any cryptocurrency to rival traditional currency, but the idea is no longer
    science fiction. It could actually happen within our lifetimes. And if it does,
    we will realize new efficiencies in all kinds of transactions by undercutting
    third parties, creating fewer transaction costs, saving time, enjoying better
    security and safety, and preserving near-total anonymity.
