    such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, which can be used to purchase assets,
    goods, and services, just like cash. However, cryptocurrencies use blockchain
    to achieve the benefits of a public ledger as well as an advanced cryptographic
    security system so that online transactions are always chronicled and secure.

- en: All transactions that occur on a cryptocurrency network are not necessarily
    a consequence of payment between two people. Some of these transactions are somewhat
    different. The first transaction in the blockchain took place in Bitcoin. It was
    a special transaction that allocated reward transactions for miners inside the
    first block of the blockchain, called the “genesis block.” These reward transactions
    are typically given to miners as an incentive or reward for their work. This type
    of transaction is known as a Coinbase transaction. These transactions generate
    new currencies, which have never been spent (for example, the printing of fiat
    currencies).

- en: When the first genesis block of Bitcoin was mined by Nakamoto (2008, he created
    a coinbase with a value of 50 BTC based on the halving factor prevailing at that
    time and made the payment to the Bitcoin address “1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.”
    However, this block was never confirmed, and the reward paid at the given address
    could not be spent. Although blockchain developers and experts could not find
    the reason, it can be safely assumed that the first Coinbase transaction was encoded
    in the source code of Bitcoin’s genesis block, on which the entire blockchain
    is built. Hence, the concept of confirmation is not applicable for this block.

    In Bitcoin, this event occurs after every 210,000 successful blocks are mined.
    By reducing the rewards of mining Bitcoins or by limiting the number of Bitcoins,
    the supply of coins is limited, thereby keeping demand strong and increasing the

    These transactions are verified by so-called miners who add only valid transactions
    to the blockchain and are thus rewarded with Bitcoins. It is a technology that

    value (not backed by a physical commodity like gold). But the question arises

    some organizations tend to go for major holdings and thus inflate the prices.

    the years, as it gained mainstream traction and price escalation, Bitcoin became
    an investment vehicle rather than a currency. The blockchain platform on which
    it worked was seen to lack scalability as it was inherently incapable of handling
    large numbers of transactions. The MB block size limit for Bitcoin led to an increase
    in the confirmation times and fees for transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.
    The inordinate delay in waiting for confirmations caused transactions to become
    queued, as the blocks could not handle the increase in transaction size. Hence,
    another cryptocurrency was created which shared many features with Bitcoin and
    also solved such problems – Bitcoin Cash.

    transaction and they want to sign the same message, each of them must include
    their own public key and signature. This mean that if three parties are involved
    in a transaction, the document would include three public keys and three signatures,

    require each node to perform signature verification three times and store them

    needs to verify a signature and the public key to ensure that all three parties
    have signed the message.

- en: Due to fork technology, Bitcoins exist simultaneously without any disruption.
    Both the BTC and BCH coins use a Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA). The network
    difficulty for BTC is adjusted every 14 days or after each block of 2016, while
    for BCH, it is adjusted every ten minutes or after each block. The difficulty
    tells us how much computing power the miner will need for each block.

- en: Bitcoin Cash deploys an exponentially moving target difficulty adjustment algorithm
    called “aserti3-2d.” For every two days when blocks are behind schedule, the difficulty
    is halved, while every two days when blocks are ahead of schedule, the difficulty
    doubles. Accordingly, SHA256 miners move their hashing power from BTC to BCH and
    back. Bitcoin Cash’s DAA ensures that blocks continue to be produced at the desired
    consistent rate.

- en: The transaction fee for Bitcoin Cash is around US$ 0.28\. The major reason for
    such a low transaction fee is that it is able to store large transaction details,
    owing to its large block size, and work faster due to its high speed. A transaction
    fee applies only when one transfers cryptocurrency to someone else’s address.
    Bitcoin Cash is the most popular cryptocurrency among people due to its low-cost
    fees and secure, transparent transactions.

    of Bitcoin Cash wanted to use it as a medium of exchange in goods and commerce,
    while opponents sought it to be a means of storing value. Therefore, in 2018,
    it created another off-shoot crypto: Bitcoin SV.'

    One group, backed by Bitmain’s Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, wanted to restrict the
    block size to 32 MB. The other side was supported by Steven Wright and Calvin
    Ayre who wanted to increase the block size to 128 MB, and they formed Bitcoin
    SV.
