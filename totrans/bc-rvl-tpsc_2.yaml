    physics. Born into Russian aristocracy before the turn of the twentieth century,
    Termen joined the Bolsheviks in dismantling the tsarist autocracy. One of his
    early missions was to create a device that could measure the electrical conductivity
    and capacity of various gases. He tried gas-filled lamps, he tried a high-frequency
    oscillator, and he even tried hypnosis.[¹](notes.xhtml#en0467en) The oscillator
    ended up working well, and so Termen’s boss encouraged him to seek other applications
    for it. Two apps would become legendary. The more whimsical of the two started
    out as two metal terminals with nothing between them, like a lamp without the
    glass. Termen discovered that, if he infused this void with gas, he could gauge
    the gas’s electrical properties. His design was brilliant: he substituted headphones
    for dials so that he could take acoustic rather than visual readings, monitoring
    the pitch of the signal that each gas produced. It was way ahead of its time,
    the stuff of Dr. Emmett Brown’s garage in *Back to the Future*.'

    Whenever he put his hands near the metal terminals, the pitch of the signal changed.
    He learned that he could manipulate the pitch by the precise position and motion
    of his hands. He called his device the “etherphone,” known today as the theremin,
    an anglicized version of his name. The other app was a larger-scale version of
    this apparatus, one that was sensitive to movement within a radius of several
    meters. It was the first motion detector—sentry of the ether. He demonstrated
    both of these instruments at the Kremlin, playing his etherphone with abandon
    for Comrade Lenin. While Lenin delighted in the etherphone, he put the motion
    detector immediately to work in watching over the Soviet stashes of gold. If anyone
    crossed the electromagnetic line around the gold, they’d set off a silent alarm.

    shape to airy nothing, they were usurped by dark forces. Lenin even co-opted electricity

    cryptocurrency, and very few have heard of blockchain the technology. You the
    reader are among the forward-thinking few. Bitcoin conjures images ranging from
    a pyramid scheme and a money Laundromat to a financial E-ZPass on the economic
    highway for value. Either way, the infrastructure isn’t ready for prime time,
    so goes the argument.

    author William Gibson, that the future is here; its *infrastructure* is just unevenly
    distributed. Had Greek citizens known about bitcoin during their country’s economic
    crash in 2015, they still would’ve been hard-pressed to locate a bitcoin exchange
    or a bitcoin ATM anywhere in Athens. They wouldn’t have been able to transfer
    their drachmas into bitcoins to hedge against the plummeting fiat currency. Computer
    scientist Nick Szabo and information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos both
    argued that robust infrastructure matters and can’t be bootstrapped during catastrophes.
    Antonopoulos said that Greece’s blockchain infrastructure was lacking at the time
    of the crisis, and there was insufficient bitcoin liquidity for an entire population
    to move its troubled fiat currency into it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'On the other hand, the bitcoin blockchain isn’t ready for Greece either. That’s
    the second facet: it falls short on security controls for such a massive bump
    in usage. “The system lacks the *transactional capacity* to on-board ten million
    people. That would represent almost a tenfold increase in user base overnight,”
    said Antonopoulos. “Remember what happened when AOL dumped 2.3 million e-mail
    accounts onto the Internet? We quickly discovered that the Internet wasn’t ready,
    in terms of spam protection and Net etiquette, to absorb 2.3 million noobs who
    didn’t have the culture. That’s not good for an immature technology.”[³](notes.xhtml#en0469en)
    The blockchain would be susceptible to capacity problems, system failures, unanticipated
    bugs, and perhaps most damaging, the huge disappointment of technically unsophisticated
    users, none of which it needs at the moment.'

    the average person. There’s not enough wallet support, and many interfaces are
    user-*un*friendly, requiring a high tolerance for alphanumeric code and geekspeak.
    Most bitcoin addresses are simply strings of between twenty-six and thirty-five
    characters beginning with a one or a three, quite tedious to type. As Tyler Winklevoss
    said, “When you go to [Google.com](http://Google.com) you don’t type in a string
    of numbers. You don’t type in an IP address. You type in a name, a word that you
    can remember. And the same goes with the bitcoin addresses. Bitcoin addresses
    shouldn’t be exposed to the average user. Little things like that make a difference.”[⁴](notes.xhtml#en0470en)

    a rules-based monetary policy intended to prevent inflation triggered by arbitrary
    and discretionary monetary policies, a phenomenon commonplace for many fiat currencies.
    Satoshi wrote, “It’s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing
    to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes.
    As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential
    for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could
    attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.”[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0471en)

    have lost their private keys are not recoverable; they just sit dormant on the
    blockchain, and so there will be fewer than 21 million in circulation. Early adopters
    have tended to hold on to bitcoin as they hold on to gold, hoping that its value
    will increase in the long run, and therefore treating bitcoin as an asset rather
    than as a medium of exchange. According to economic theorists, low or no inflation
    motivates holders to hoard rather than spend their bitcoin. Still, if more trusted
    bitcoin exchanges facilitate consumers’ movement in and out of bitcoin, then the
    frequency and volume of trading could increase. If more merchants accept bitcoin
    as a medium of payment, then people who’ve been sitting on bitcoins may start
    to use their store for purchases, thereby freeing up more bitcoins. If merchants
    begin to issue bitcoin-denominated gift cards, then more people should be exposed
    to cryptocurrencies and become more comfortable transacting in bitcoin. And so,
    hypothetically, people will have fewer reasons to hoard bitcoin. Advocates of
    the bitcoin protocol argue that, because bitcoins are divisible to eight decimal
    places—the smallest unit is called a Satoshi, worth one hundredth of a millionth
    of a bitcoin—the smallest denominations will buy more if demand for bitcoin increases.
    There’s also the possibility of tweaking the protocols to allow for greater divisibility,
    say, picopayments (trillionths of a bitcoin) and to remine stranded bitcoin after
    a period of dormancy.

    ten minutes is simply too long for the Internet of Things where devices need to

    latency is more critical and fraud is less of an issue or where parties could

    weaknesses such as market timing attacks.[⁶](notes.xhtml#en0472en) The immediate

    Today, many people count on their bank or credit card company, even talking with
    a real person, when they make an accounting error, forget their passwords, or
    lose their wallets or checkbooks. Most people with bank accounts aren’t in the
    habit of backing up their money on a flash drive or a second device, securing
    their passwords so that they needn’t rely on a service provider’s password reset
    function, or keeping these backups in separate locations so that, if they lose
    their computer and all other possessions in a house fire, they don’t lose their
    money. Without this discipline, they might as well stuff their mattress with cash.
    With greater freedom—better privacy, stronger security, and autonomy from third-party
    cost structures and system failures—comes greater responsibility. For those consumers

    the particular set of rules to which they want to abide, but—after the choice
    has been made—can no longer deviate from these rules, to the extent that smart
    contracts are automatically enforced by the underlying code of the technology,
    regardless of the will of the parties.”[⁹](notes.xhtml#en0475en) This very high
    degree of certainty—mathematical certainty—as to the outcome of a transaction
    or a smart contract is unprecedented in society. It delivers greater efficiencies
    and effectively eliminates nonperformance risk because we have no choice of breach,
    no choice of damages. But that’s also a downside. It allows no room for human
    beings. To Josh Fairfield of Washington and Lee University School of Law, that
    means “more messiness, not less. We’re going to see more fights. ‘You didn’t actually
    renovate my house, I want my money back.’ We’re going to see more human messiness,

    should those numbers improve in a blockchain world? When the code indicates that
    the contract has been fully executed rather than breached, except one party is
    dissatisfied with the outcome, will the dissatisfied party actually pursue a lawsuit?
    Will the courts recognize the case? Will the small business owner back away from
    the corporate legal team of Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe or—with his modest resources—even

    minted halves every four years, what will happen when the reward drops to zero?
    The mining cycle depends on the market price of bitcoin. When the price drops,
    some bitcoin miners park their supply, but they continue to play the lottery until
    the price increases. Other miners can’t afford to park and play; they just dry-dock
    their mining rigs or divert their processing power to another altchain that might
    be more profitable. Still others join mining pools, pooling their computing power
    with nodes with the hope of increasing their odds and at least getting some fraction
    of the winnings rather than nothing at all. And then there’s the industrial bitcoin
    mining complex. Valery Vavilov of BitFury estimated that his mining operation

    they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when
    the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.”[^(44)](notes.xhtml#en0510en)
    So once all bitcoins have been minted, a fee structure will likely emerge. Think
    in terms of billions of nanopayments. Because each block has a fixed maximum size,
    there is a limit to how many transactions a miner can include. Therefore, miners
    will add transactions with the highest fees first, leaving those with low or zero
    fees to fight for whatever space might be left over. If your transaction fee is
    high enough, you can expect a miner to include it in the next block; but if the
    network is busy and your fee is too low, it might take two, three, or more blocks
    before a miner eventually records in the blockchain.

    and force their version of the truth on the bitcoin network. They wouldn’t necessarily
    get rich. Far from it. All they could do is to reverse their own transactions
    within a previous block, rather like a credit card chargeback. Let’s say the attackers
    bought some big-ticket item from the same merchant, waited until it shipped, then
    attacked the network to get their money back. That wouldn’t mean tacking its own
    block to the end of the blockchain. That would mean going back and redoing the
    block that contained all their purchases as well as all subsequent blocks, even
    as the network continues to generate new blocks. When the cartel’s branch became

    Or perhaps some central power would step in, in the interest of consumer protection,

    prevent hostile takeovers of personless businesses? Let’s say we own a decentralized
    Web hosting company where each of the servers has a say in company management.
    A human hacker or some malware could pretend to be a million servers and outvote
    the legitimate servers in the network. When such takeovers of traditional companies
    occur, the results can vary. With a DAE, the results will most likely be disastrous.
    Once that malevolent entity controls our distributed Web hosting company, it could
    cash out. Or it could release the private data from other servers or hold the
    data hostage until we human owners paid a ransom.

    every IT system, every business practice, and all infrastructure should have full

    transparency in all operations, and subject their organizations to independent

    Chances are, you’ve heard of Silk Road, the dark Web marketplace for illegal drugs.
    At its peak in October 2013, Silk Road had 13,756 listings priced in bitcoin.
    Products were delivered by mail with a guide to avoiding detection by authorities.

    more effective for criminals than other technologies. Authorities in general believe

    to the Internet of Things. Marc Goodman, author of *Future Crimes*, argued recently,
    “There’s never been a computer system that’s proven unhackable.”[^(59)](notes.xhtml#en0525en)

    longest time, most financial institutions dismissed bitcoin as the speculative
    tool of gamblers and criminals, and barely even registered blockchain on their
    radars. Today they are quite literally “all in.” Watching this unfold in real
    time in 2015 was truly incredible. Before 2015, few major financial institutions
    had announced investments in the sector. Today Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
    Bank of Montreal, Société Générale, State Street, CIBC, RBC, TD Bank, Mitsubishi
    UFJ Financial Group, BNY Mellon, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, Nordea, ING, UniCredit,
    Commerzbank, Macquarie, and *dozens* of others are investing in the technology
    and wading into the leadership discussion. Most of the world’s biggest banks have
    signed up to the R3 consortium and many more have partnered with the Linux Foundation
    to launch the Hyperledger Project. Banks should be included in the discussion
    about leadership, but other stakeholders must remain cautious of powerful incumbents
    looking to control this technology, just as they had to tread cautiously in the
    early days of the Internet.

    a $340 million settlement with U.K. bank Standard Chartered PLC for its handling

    U.S. and E.U. sanctions. In the process, NYDFS scooped the Justice Department,

    case against the big banks, when an economist on his staff knocked on his door
    to discuss some unusual inquiries. According to a few lawyers on the street, several
    client firms were transacting in some strange new virtual currency called bitcoin.
    Lawsky’s first reaction was “What the heck is bitcoin?”[^(29)](notes.xhtml#en0558en)
    The economist went on to explain that these companies had customers who were buying,
    selling, trading, and paying for goods and services with this digital dollar and
    that the lawyers, ever cautious, wanted to know whether this kind of activity
    qualified as money transmission, and if so, what to do about it. In New York,
    money transmissions are typically regulated at the state level; and so the NYDFS,
    as the state regulator in New York, had a duty to regulate any entity engaged
    in money transmission. But how? Lawsky hadn’t even heard about the technology,
    and he had a sneaking suspicion this would be a very different kind of challenge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost immediately, Lawsky was confronted with a problem that has become all
    too commonplace, that disruptive technology does not fit neatly into existing
    regulatory boxes, a hallmark of the digital age. In his mind, bitcoin didn’t fit
    at all. Bitcoin is global in reach; federal and state governments would be limited
    in the scope of what they can do to govern and regulate it. Moreover, the technology
    is peer to peer and decentralized. Regulators make a living monitoring large intermediaries.
    Their centralized ledgers contain troves of data, ideal for building cases. And
    in the digital age, officials in government are rarely, if ever, in possession
    of all the information needed to make decisions in the public interest. Often,
    they lack resources to govern it effectively and can be ill informed about innovation.
    Lawsky was coming to terms with something that governments and regulators of digital
    technologies had wrestled with for twenty years. Thanks to luck, foresight, and
    a different regulatory framework, the Internet was able to grow and thrive. Cryptocurrencies
    were another example of how digital technology is wresting control from traditional
    decision makers, including governments.

    them woefully inadequate. The department initially wanted to regulate this technology
    by enforcing rules written around the time of the Civil War. Those money transmission
    laws couldn’t possibly address any kind of digital technology like the Internet,
    let alone digital currencies or cybersecurity. “The more I learned, the more interested
    I got in how powerful this technology is, and I saw all the various applications
    and platforms that were going to be built, over time,” he said. If he “could get
    regulation right, to make sure the bad stuff we didn’t want to see happening in
    the ecosystem was avoided, and at the same time not have regulation be too overbearing,
    then we had a real chance of helping a very powerful technology make serious improvements
    to our system.”[^(30)](notes.xhtml#en0559en) Lawsky concluded, “Maybe we need
    a new type of regulatory framework to deal with something that is just qualitatively
    different?”[^(31)](notes.xhtml#en0560en) His proposal, the BitLicense, was the
    first serious attempt to provide a regulatory lens onto this industry. A controversial
    piece of law, it revealed how even well-intentioned regulations can produce unintended
    consequences. When the BitLicense went into effect, there was a mass exodus of
    companies such as Bitfinex, GoCoin, and Kraken from New York; they cited the prohibitive
    cost of the license as a main cause. The few that stayed are well-capitalized
    and more mature businesses.

    Licensed exchanges, such as Gemini, have gained ground, perhaps because their
    institutional clientele know they’re now as regulated as banks. But with fewer
    competitors, will the BitLicense stifle innovation and cripple growth? Brito argued
    that the BitLicense misses the mark by applying old solutions to new problems.
    He cited the BitLicense rule that if you take custody of consumer funds, you need
    to get a license. “With something like bitcoin and other digital currencies, you
    have technologies like multisig [multisignature] that, for the first time, introduce
    the concept of divided control. So if the three of us each have a key to a multisig
    address that needs two out of three, who has custody of the funds?”[^(32)](notes.xhtml#en0561en)

    interesting time … you have this world of technology, which is usually largely
    unregulated, colliding with probably the most regulated system in the world, the
    financial system. No one really knows what comes of that collision,” he said.

    central bank, celebrated its centennial in 2013.[^(44)](notes.xhtml#en0573en)
    Central banks, in their relatively short history, have gone through multiple reincarnations,
    the last one a big shift from the gold standard to a floating-rate system of fiat
    currencies. Because digital currencies challenge the role of central banks in
    an economy, we might expect central bankers to oppose blockchain technology. However,
    over the years, these bankers have shown a willingness to innovate. The Fed pioneered
    electronic clearing of funds by championing the Automated Clearing House (ACH)
    system when all checks were settled and cleared manually. Like central banks elsewhere,
    the Fed has savored experimentation. It has embraced unorthodox and untested policies,
    most famously (or infamously) the quantitative easing program in the wake of the
    2008 financial crisis, when it used newly minted money to buy financial assets
    such as government bonds at an unprecedented scale.

    and enhancing the performance of central banks in the global economy.

    central banks. How do they perform their role effectively in a global market with

    you just need to switch to something else.” She believes the blockchain could
    be that something else. “It’s hard not to be fascinated by something so transformative.

    central banks do. Broadly speaking, these august institutions perform three roles.
    First, they manage monetary policy by setting interest rates and controlling the
    money supply and in exceptional circumstances by injecting capital directly into
    the system. Second, they attempt to maintain financial stability. This means they
    act as the banker for government and for the banks in the financial system; they
    are the lender of last resort. Finally, central banks often share the responsibility
    with other government entities of regulating and monitoring the financial system,
    particularly the activities of banks that deal with savings and loans to average
    consumers.[^(47)](notes.xhtml#en0576en) Invariably, all of these roles are intertwined
    and codependent.

    provider of last resort. We do that in Canadian dollars. Therefore, Canadian dollars
    are important as a source of liquidity for the Canadian financial system,” Wilkins
    said. What if transactions are in another currency like bitcoin? “Our ability
    to provide lender of last resort services would be limited.”[^(48)](notes.xhtml#en0577en)
    The solution? Central banks could simply begin holding reserves in bitcoin, as
    they do in other currencies, and assets such as gold. They could also require
    financial institutions to hold reserves at the central bank in these nonstate
    currencies. These holdings would enable a central bank to perform their monetary
    role in both fiat and cryptocurrencies. Sounds prudent, right?

    “The implications [for monetary policy] of electronic money depend on how it’s

    could be denominated by a government in a national currency or as a cryptocurrency.[^(49)](notes.xhtml#en0578en)
    A digital currency denominated in Canadian dollars would be easy to manage, she
    said. If anything, it would help a central bank to respond more quickly. Most
    likely, we will see a combination of the two: central banks will hold and manage
    alternative blockchain-based currencies as they do foreign reserves and will explore
    converting fiat currency to so-called e-money through a blockchain-based ledger.

    innovation. For example, the 2008 financial crisis showed how the speed and complexity
    of the global economic system renders traditional centralized rule making and
    enforcement increasingly ineffective. But stronger regulation isn’t the antidote.
    Governments cannot hope to oversee and regulate every corner of the financial
    market, technology, or the economy, because there are simply too many actors,
    innovations, and products. If anything, the experience illustrates that governments
    can at least force transparency to shed light on behavior and create change. Governments
    can demand that the actions of banks, for example, be transparent on the Web and
    let citizens and other parties contribute their own data and observations. Citizens
    can even help enforce regulations, too, perhaps by changing their buying behavior
    or, armed with information, by organizing public campaigns that name and shame
    offenders.

    technological innovation and disruption? How can we avoid massive social dislocation,
    or worse? Lest we be accused of being technology determinists or utopians, may
    we propose that it’s time for a new social contract for the digital age. Governments,
    the private sector, the civil society, and individuals need to collaborate to
    forge new common understandings.

    learning, and renewed freedom of speech online without the fear of surveillance.

    Surely, those who work should share in the wealth they create. If computers can
    do the work, then the workweek, not our standard of living, should be reduced.
    In fact, Satoshi’s implicit design principles for the blockchain revolution should
    serve us well—we need institutions that act with integrity, security, privacy,
    inclusion, rights protection, and distributed power. Let’s work to distribute
    opportunity and prosperity at the point of origin, rather than simply redistributing
    wealth after it’s been created by traditional class structures.

    still need new *Laws* in many areas. There are technological and business model
    solutions to the challenges of intellectual property and rights ownership. So
    we should be rewriting or trashing old laws that stifle innovation through overprotection
    of patents. Better antitrust action must stem the trend toward monopolies so that
    no one overpays for, say, basic Internet or financial services. Eighty percent
    of Americans have no choice when it comes to Internet service providers, which
    might help explain why bandwidth is one of the slowest and most expensive in the
    developed world. Criminal fixers who manipulate everything from foreign exchange
    to diesel emissions should be prosecuted and punished appropriately.

    need to change their role in currency management and monetary policy and collaborate
    multilaterally with more stakeholders in the economy and society. We need schools
    and universities with student-focused, customized collaborative mastery of information
    on the blockchain, freeing up students and teachers alike to participate in small
    group discussion and projects. We need a universal patient record on the blockchain,
    to ensure collaborative health when we can manage our own wellness outside of
    the system. When we enter the health care system, we should not suffer because
    of ignorance-inspired drug interactions or medicine not based on evidence. Politicians
    will need to adapt to a transparent world where smart contracts ensure their accountability
    to electorates. How do we manage the disruption after digital currencies upend
    the $500 billion remittances market?

    and GE Information Services, all of which are gone. At least he didn’t include

    Gannett could have created Craigslist or Kijiji. eBay would have been a natural

    number of business models based on the Internet rather than the personal computer.
    Why didn’t NBC invent YouTube? Sony could have preempted Apple’s iTunes. Where

    genie has been unleashed from its bottle … now at our service for another kick
    at the can—to transform the economic power grid and the old order of human affairs.
    If we will it.” Like the first generation of the Internet, the Blockchain Revolution
    promises to upend business models and transform industries. But that is just the
    start. Blockchain technology is pushing us inexorably into a new era, predicated
    on openness, merit, decentralization, and global participation.

    Is Ben Lawsky right—that the industry could be unrecognizable in five to ten years?
    Tim Draper said, “Bitcoin is to the dollar as the Internet is to paper.”[^(74)](notes.xhtml#en0603en)
    Could it be that blockchain’s most ardent supporters are actually *underestimating*
    the long-term potential here? Will the blockchain be the biggest boon to industry
    efficiency and value since the invention of double-entry accounting or the joint-stock
    corporation? Hernando de Soto said blockchain holds the potential to bring five
    billion people into the global economy, change the relationship between the state
    and citizens (for the better), and become a powerful new platform for global prosperity
    and a guarantor of individual rights. To him, “the whole idea of peace through
    law, the whole idea of one family humankind is that we reach agreement on common
    standards. We should consider how the Universal Declaration of Human Rights could
    be better served with blockchain.”[^(75)](notes.xhtml#en0604en) How can we achieve
    this better future?

    of the people quoted in this book. Then again, who’d heard of Iranian immigrant
    Pierre Omidyar or Wall Street programmer Jeff Bezos in 1994? Much depends on how
    the leaders of the industry get on board. Is a blockchain alternative to Facebook
    or Twitter really achievable or will the incumbents respond by addressing user
    concerns about data ownership and privacy? Doesn’t matter. Consumers win either
    way. Will Visa wither or will it change its business model to embrace the power
    of blockchain? How will Apple respond to an artist-centered music industry? What
    will tin-pot dictators think about a decentralized Internet that they can’t turn
    off or control? Can the blockchain make technology accessible to the world’s two
    billion unbanked people?

    case studies to fall by the wayside, not because blockchain technology is a bad
    idea, but because—for each one of our examples—there are many competing start-ups.
    All of them can’t survive. We believe those that follow Satoshi’s principles have
    a better shot than those that don’t.
