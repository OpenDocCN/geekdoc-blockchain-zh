- en: 'Lev Sergeyevich Termen was a gifted musician, but he preferred playing with
    physics. Born into Russian aristocracy before the turn of the twentieth century,
    Termen joined the Bolsheviks in dismantling the tsarist autocracy. One of his
    early missions was to create a device that could measure the electrical conductivity
    and capacity of various gases. He tried gas-filled lamps, he tried a high-frequency
    oscillator, and he even tried hypnosis.[¹](notes.xhtml#en0467en) The oscillator
    ended up working well, and so Termen’s boss encouraged him to seek other applications
    for it. Two apps would become legendary. The more whimsical of the two started
    out as two metal terminals with nothing between them, like a lamp without the
    glass. Termen discovered that, if he infused this void with gas, he could gauge
    the gas’s electrical properties. His design was brilliant: he substituted headphones
    for dials so that he could take acoustic rather than visual readings, monitoring
    the pitch of the signal that each gas produced. It was way ahead of its time,
    the stuff of Dr. Emmett Brown’s garage in *Back to the Future*.'

  zh: 列夫·谢苗诺维奇·特斯拉是一位天赋异禀的音乐家，但他更喜欢玩弄物理。20世纪初，他出生于俄罗斯贵族家庭，加入了布尔什维克党，推翻了沙皇专制。他早期的任务之一就是制造一种可以测量各种气体电气导电性和容量的设备。他尝试过充满气体的灯泡，试过高频振荡器，甚至试过催眠。[¹](notes.xhtml#en0467en)
    振荡器最终效果不错，因此特斯拉的老板鼓励他为它寻求其他应用。其中两个应用将变得传奇。更具幻想性的那个最初只是两个金属端子之间什么都没有，就像没有玻璃的灯泡。特斯拉发现，如果他用气体充满这个空隙，他可以测量气体的电气属性。他的设计非常巧妙：他用耳机代替了刻度盘，这样他就可以通过声音而不是视觉来读数，监控每种气体产生的信号的音高。这在当时是非常先进的，是《回到未来》中艾米特·布朗博士的车库里那种东西。
- en: 'Devotees of TED talks and students of technological history already know the
    end of this story: Termen stumbled upon a means of making music out of thin air.
    Whenever he put his hands near the metal terminals, the pitch of the signal changed.
    He learned that he could manipulate the pitch by the precise position and motion
    of his hands. He called his device the “etherphone,” known today as the theremin,
    an anglicized version of his name. The other app was a larger-scale version of
    this apparatus, one that was sensitive to movement within a radius of several
    meters. It was the first motion detector—sentry of the ether. He demonstrated
    both of these instruments at the Kremlin, playing his etherphone with abandon
    for Comrade Lenin. While Lenin delighted in the etherphone, he put the motion
    detector immediately to work in watching over the Soviet stashes of gold. If anyone
    crossed the electromagnetic line around the gold, they’d set off a silent alarm.

    shape to airy nothing, they were usurped by dark forces. Lenin even co-opted electricity
    in his propaganda, equating communism with Soviet power plus the electrification
    of the country.[²](notes.xhtml#en0468en) But it was Stalin who rounded up Termen

- en: The challenge is multifaceted. The first facet borrows from science fiction
    author William Gibson, that the future is here; its *infrastructure* is just unevenly
    distributed. Had Greek citizens known about bitcoin during their country’s economic
    crash in 2015, they still would’ve been hard-pressed to locate a bitcoin exchange
    or a bitcoin ATM anywhere in Athens. They wouldn’t have been able to transfer
    their drachmas into bitcoins to hedge against the plummeting fiat currency. Computer
    scientist Nick Szabo and information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos both
    argued that robust infrastructure matters and can’t be bootstrapped during catastrophes.
    Antonopoulos said that Greece’s blockchain infrastructure was lacking at the time
    of the crisis, and there was insufficient bitcoin liquidity for an entire population
    to move its troubled fiat currency into it.

  zh: 挑战是多方面的。第一个方面借鉴了科幻小说作者威廉·吉布森的观点，即未来已来；其*基础设施*只是分布不均。如果希腊公民在2015年本国经济崩溃时知道了比特币，他们仍然会在雅典找不到任何一个比特币交易所或比特币ATM。他们无法将他们的德拉克马转换成比特币，以对冲不断贬值的法定货币。计算机科学家尼克·萨博和信息安全专家
    Andreas Antonopoulos 都认为，强大的基础设施很重要，而且在灾难期间无法自发生成。Antonopoulos 表示，在危机时刻，希腊的区块链基础设施不足，而且整个
    population 缺乏足够的比特币流动性来将其有问题的法定货币转入比特币。
- en: 'On the other hand, the bitcoin blockchain isn’t ready for Greece either. That’s
    the second facet: it falls short on security controls for such a massive bump
    in usage. “The system lacks the *transactional capacity* to on-board ten million
    people. That would represent almost a tenfold increase in user base overnight,”
    said Antonopoulos. “Remember what happened when AOL dumped 2.3 million e-mail
    accounts onto the Internet? We quickly discovered that the Internet wasn’t ready,
    in terms of spam protection and Net etiquette, to absorb 2.3 million noobs who
    didn’t have the culture. That’s not good for an immature technology.”[³](notes.xhtml#en0469en)
    The blockchain would be susceptible to capacity problems, system failures, unanticipated
    bugs, and perhaps most damaging, the huge disappointment of technically unsophisticated
    users, none of which it needs at the moment.'

  zh: 另一方面，比特币区块链对希腊人来说也不够成熟。这是第二个方面：它在使用量大幅增加时缺乏安全控制。“系统缺乏*交易能力*来容纳一千万人口。这几乎意味着用户基础会在一夜之间增加十倍，”安东诺普洛斯说。“还记得当AOL将230万个电子邮件账户投入到互联网上时发生了什么吗？我们很快发现，互联网在垃圾邮件保护和网络礼仪方面还没有准备好吸收230万个没有文化的菜鸟。这对于一个不成熟的技术来说是不好的。”[³](notes.xhtml#en0469en)
    区块链将面临容量问题、系统故障、未预见的错误，或许最糟糕的是，技术不成熟的用户的巨大失望，这些都是它目前不需要的。
- en: That relates to the third facet of this showstopper, its *inaccessibility* to
    the average person. There’s not enough wallet support, and many interfaces are
    user-*un*friendly, requiring a high tolerance for alphanumeric code and geekspeak.
    Most bitcoin addresses are simply strings of between twenty-six and thirty-five
    characters beginning with a one or a three, quite tedious to type. As Tyler Winklevoss
    said, “When you go to [Google.com](http://Google.com) you don’t type in a string
    of numbers. You don’t type in an IP address. You type in a name, a word that you
    can remember. And the same goes with the bitcoin addresses. Bitcoin addresses
    shouldn’t be exposed to the average user. Little things like that make a difference.”[⁴](notes.xhtml#en0470en)
    So there’s much work to be done in basic user interface and experience.

  zh: 这涉及到这个问题的第三方面，即它对普通人来说*难以接触*。钱包支持不足，许多界面不友好，需要有很高的字母数字代码和极客语言的容忍度。大多数比特币地址只是一串由二十六个到三十五个字符组成，以1或3开头的字符串，输入起来相当繁琐。正如泰勒·温克勒沃斯所说，“当你去[Google.com](http://Google.com)时，你不会输入一串数字。你不会输入一个IP地址。你输入一个名字，一个你能记住的词。比特币地址也是一样。比特币地址不应该暴露给普通用户。这种小事会带来差别。”[⁴](notes.xhtml#en0470en)
    所以在基础用户界面和体验方面还有很多工作要做。
- en: Critics have also raised concerns about long-term *illiquidity* because bitcoin
    is finite in quantity—21 million by 2140—and mined at a diminishing rate. It’s
    a rules-based monetary policy intended to prevent inflation triggered by arbitrary
    and discretionary monetary policies, a phenomenon commonplace for many fiat currencies.
    Satoshi wrote, “It’s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing
    to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes.
    As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential
    for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could
    attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.”[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0471en)

  zh: 批评者还提出了关于长期*流动性不足*的问题，因为比特币数量有限——到2140年为2100万——并且挖矿速度在减慢。这是一种基于规则的货币政策，旨在防止由于任意和自由裁量的货币政策而引发的通货膨胀，这种现象对于许多法定货币来说很常见。中本聪写道：“这更像是贵金属。不是通过供应的变化来保持价值不变，而是供应是预先确定的，而价值发生变化。随着用户数量的增加，每枚硬币的价值会增加。它有正反馈循环的潜力；随着用户的增加，价值上升，这可能会吸引更多用户利用增加的价值。”[⁵](notes.xhtml#en0471en)
- en: At the margin, coins stored in lost wallets or sent to addresses whose owners
    have lost their private keys are not recoverable; they just sit dormant on the
    blockchain, and so there will be fewer than 21 million in circulation. Early adopters
    have tended to hold on to bitcoin as they hold on to gold, hoping that its value
    will increase in the long run, and therefore treating bitcoin as an asset rather
    than as a medium of exchange. According to economic theorists, low or no inflation
    motivates holders to hoard rather than spend their bitcoin. Still, if more trusted
    bitcoin exchanges facilitate consumers’ movement in and out of bitcoin, then the
    frequency and volume of trading could increase. If more merchants accept bitcoin
    as a medium of payment, then people who’ve been sitting on bitcoins may start
    to use their store for purchases, thereby freeing up more bitcoins. If merchants
    begin to issue bitcoin-denominated gift cards, then more people should be exposed
    to cryptocurrencies and become more comfortable transacting in bitcoin. And so,
    hypothetically, people will have fewer reasons to hoard bitcoin. Advocates of
    the bitcoin protocol argue that, because bitcoins are divisible to eight decimal
    places—the smallest unit is called a Satoshi, worth one hundredth of a millionth
    of a bitcoin—the smallest denominations will buy more if demand for bitcoin increases.
    There’s also the possibility of tweaking the protocols to allow for greater divisibility,
    say, picopayments (trillionths of a bitcoin) and to remine stranded bitcoin after
    a period of dormancy.

  zh: 在边缘情况下，存储在丢失的钱包中或发送到丢失私钥的地址的硬币是不可恢复的；它们只是静静地躺在区块链上，因此流通中的比特币将少于2100万个。早期采用者往往像持有黄金一样持有比特币，希望其价值在长期内会增加，因此将比特币视为资产而非交换媒介。根据经济学家理论，低通胀或无通胀会促使持有者囤积而非花费比特币。然而，如果更多的可信比特币交易所促进消费者进出比特币，那么交易频率和交易量可能会增加。如果更多的商家接受比特币作为支付手段，那么那些持有比特币的人可能会开始用他们的储备进行购买，从而释放出更多比特币。如果商家开始发行以比特币为面值的礼品卡，那么更多的人可能会接触加密货币，并在比特币中进行交易感到更加舒适。因此，从理论上讲，人们将没有囤积比特币的理由。比特币协议的拥护者认为，因为比特币可以细分到八位小数位——最小的单位叫做
    Satoshi，价值为比特币的一百万分之一百——如果比特币需求增加，最小的细分单位将购买到更多商品。还有可能调整协议以实现更大的可分性，比如微支付（比特币的一万亿分之一）并在一段时间休眠后重新挖掘被困的比特币。
- en: 'A fifth dimension is *high latency*: for the bitcoin blockchain network, the
    process of clearing and settling transactions takes about ten minutes, which is
    far faster end to end than most payment mechanisms. But clearing transactions
    at the point of sale instantaneously is not the issue; the real problem is that
    ten minutes is simply too long for the Internet of Things where devices need to
    interact continuously. Core developer Gavin Andresen said solving for a trillion
    connected objects is “a different design space from bitcoin,” a space where low
    latency is more critical and fraud is less of an issue or where parties could
    establish an acceptable level of trust without the bitcoin network. Ten minutes
    is also too long for financial transactions where timing matters to get an asset
    at a particular price, and where latency exposes traders to time-based arbitrage
    weaknesses such as market timing attacks.[⁶](notes.xhtml#en0472en) The immediate
    solution for entrepreneurs has been to fork the bitcoin code base, that is, to
    modify the source code by tweaking a few parameters, and to launch a new blockchain
    with an altcoin in place of bitcoin as incentive to participate. Litecoin is a
    popular altcoin with a block time of 2.5 minutes, and Ripple and Ethereum are
    entirely reengineered blockchain platforms that have latency of seconds, not minutes.'

    创业者的直接解决方案一直是分叉比特币代码库，也就是说，通过调整几个参数来修改源代码，并推出一个新的区块链，用山寨币代替比特币作为参与激励。莱特币是一种流行的山寨币，区块时间为2.5分钟，而Ripple和以太坊则是完全重新设计的区块链平台，延迟为秒级，而不是分钟级。

    Today, many people count on their bank or credit card company, even talking with
    a real person, when they make an accounting error, forget their passwords, or
    lose their wallets or checkbooks. Most people with bank accounts aren’t in the
    habit of backing up their money on a flash drive or a second device, securing
    their passwords so that they needn’t rely on a service provider’s password reset
    function, or keeping these backups in separate locations so that, if they lose
    their computer and all other possessions in a house fire, they don’t lose their
    money. Without this discipline, they might as well stuff their mattress with cash.
    With greater freedom—better privacy, stronger security, and autonomy from third-party

    believe that it’s wrong to persecute or discriminate against individuals for something
    they did ten or fifteen years ago. We have this whole debt jubilee-esque mentality

- en: That leads us to the eighth dimension, the *lack of legal recourse* in a world
    of irrevocable transactions and unvoidable smart contracts. According to legal
    scholars Primavera De Filippi and Aaron Wright, “People are, indeed, free to decide
    the particular set of rules to which they want to abide, but—after the choice
    has been made—can no longer deviate from these rules, to the extent that smart
    contracts are automatically enforced by the underlying code of the technology,
    regardless of the will of the parties.”[⁹](notes.xhtml#en0475en) This very high
    degree of certainty—mathematical certainty—as to the outcome of a transaction
    or a smart contract is unprecedented in society. It delivers greater efficiencies
    and effectively eliminates nonperformance risk because we have no choice of breach,
    no choice of damages. But that’s also a downside. It allows no room for human
    beings. To Josh Fairfield of Washington and Lee University School of Law, that
    means “more messiness, not less. We’re going to see more fights. ‘You didn’t actually
    renovate my house, I want my money back.’ We’re going to see more human messiness,

    they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when
    the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.”[^(44)](notes.xhtml#en0510en)
    So once all bitcoins have been minted, a fee structure will likely emerge. Think
    in terms of billions of nanopayments. Because each block has a fixed maximum size,
    there is a limit to how many transactions a miner can include. Therefore, miners
    will add transactions with the highest fees first, leaving those with low or zero
    fees to fight for whatever space might be left over. If your transaction fee is
    high enough, you can expect a miner to include it in the next block; but if the
    network is busy and your fee is too low, it might take two, three, or more blocks
    before a miner eventually records in the blockchain.

    因此，一旦所有比特币都被铸造，很可能会出现一种费用结构。想想数十亿个纳米支付。因为每个区块有固定的最大大小，矿工能够包含的交易数量是有限的。因此，矿工会首先添加高费用的交易，留下低费用或零费用的交易争夺可能剩余的空间。如果你的交易费用足够高，你可以期待矿工在下个区块中包含它；但如果网络繁忙，你的费用过低，矿工可能会在第二个、第三个或更多的区块后才在区块链中记录。

    day when transaction flow suddenly surpassed blockchain capacity. Fees would skyrocket
    for people who didn’t want to wait months or years for their transactions to settle.
    Or perhaps some central power would step in, in the interest of consumer protection,
    and process the overflow. In August 2015, they went ahead and launched Bitcoin

    they personally may not be able to handle larger blocks if transaction volume
    ramps up …. I don’t have a whole lot of sympathy for that.”[^(48)](notes.xhtml#en0514en)
    In other words, if the bitcoin blockchain is to scale and remain secure, then

    If the block size increase is too large, it would put low-bandwidth Chinese miners
    at a disadvantage compared with miners in other parts of the world. Receiving
    new blocks to build upon would take longer; and when they did find a new block,
    they would take longer to send it out to the rest of the network. These delays

    transparency in all operations, and subject their organizations to independent

    qualified as money transmission, and if so, what to do about it. In New York,
    money transmissions are typically regulated at the state level; and so the NYDFS,
    as the state regulator in New York, had a duty to regulate any entity engaged
    in money transmission. But how? Lawsky hadn’t even heard about the technology,

    too commonplace, that disruptive technology does not fit neatly into existing
    regulatory boxes, a hallmark of the digital age. In his mind, bitcoin didn’t fit
    at all. Bitcoin is global in reach; federal and state governments would be limited
    in the scope of what they can do to govern and regulate it. Moreover, the technology
    is peer to peer and decentralized. Regulators make a living monitoring large intermediaries.
    Their centralized ledgers contain troves of data, ideal for building cases. And
    in the digital age, officials in government are rarely, if ever, in possession
    of all the information needed to make decisions in the public interest. Often,
    they lack resources to govern it effectively and can be ill informed about innovation.
    Lawsky was coming to terms with something that governments and regulators of digital
    technologies had wrestled with for twenty years. Thanks to luck, foresight, and
    a different regulatory framework, the Internet was able to grow and thrive. Cryptocurrencies
    were another example of how digital technology is wresting control from traditional

    Licensed exchanges, such as Gemini, have gained ground, perhaps because their

    He cited the BitLicense rule that if you take custody of consumer funds, you need
    to get a license. “With something like bitcoin and other digital currencies, you
    have technologies like multisig [multisignature] that, for the first time, introduce
    the concept of divided control. So if the three of us each have a key to a multisig

    modern phenomenon. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed), the world’s most powerful
    central bank, celebrated its centennial in 2013.[^(44)](notes.xhtml#en0573en)
    Central banks, in their relatively short history, have gone through multiple reincarnations,
    the last one a big shift from the gold standard to a floating-rate system of fiat
    currencies. Because digital currencies challenge the role of central banks in
    an economy, we might expect central bankers to oppose blockchain technology. However,
    over the years, these bankers have shown a willingness to innovate. The Fed pioneered
    electronic clearing of funds by championing the Automated Clearing House (ACH)
    system when all checks were settled and cleared manually. Like central banks elsewhere,
    the Fed has savored experimentation. It has embraced unorthodox and untested policies,
    most famously (or infamously) the quantitative easing program in the wake of the
    2008 financial crisis, when it used newly minted money to buy financial assets
    such as government bonds at an unprecedented scale.

    central banks do. Broadly speaking, these august institutions perform three roles.
    First, they manage monetary policy by setting interest rates and controlling the
    money supply and in exceptional circumstances by injecting capital directly into
    the system. Second, they attempt to maintain financial stability. This means they
    act as the banker for government and for the banks in the financial system; they
    are the lender of last resort. Finally, central banks often share the responsibility
    with other government entities of regulating and monitoring the financial system,
    particularly the activities of banks that deal with savings and loans to average
    consumers.[^(47)](notes.xhtml#en0576en) Invariably, all of these roles are intertwined

    said. What if transactions are in another currency like bitcoin? “Our ability
    to provide lender of last resort services would be limited.”[^(48)](notes.xhtml#en0577en)
    The solution? Central banks could simply begin holding reserves in bitcoin, as
    they do in other currencies, and assets such as gold. They could also require
    financial institutions to hold reserves at the central bank in these nonstate
    currencies. These holdings would enable a central bank to perform their monetary
    role in both fiat and cryptocurrencies. Sounds prudent, right?

    market, technology, or the economy, because there are simply too many actors,
    innovations, and products. If anything, the experience illustrates that governments
    can at least force transparency to shed light on behavior and create change. Governments
    can demand that the actions of banks, for example, be transparent on the Web and
    let citizens and other parties contribute their own data and observations. Citizens

- en: Most of the people leading the revolution are still unknowns, except for veterans
    like Netscape’s progenitor Marc Andreessen. You’ve likely never heard of most
    of the people quoted in this book. Then again, who’d heard of Iranian immigrant
    Pierre Omidyar or Wall Street programmer Jeff Bezos in 1994? Much depends on how
    the leaders of the industry get on board. Is a blockchain alternative to Facebook
    or Twitter really achievable or will the incumbents respond by addressing user
    concerns about data ownership and privacy? Doesn’t matter. Consumers win either
    way. Will Visa wither or will it change its business model to embrace the power
    of blockchain? How will Apple respond to an artist-centered music industry? What
    will tin-pot dictators think about a decentralized Internet that they can’t turn
    off or control? Can the blockchain make technology accessible to the world’s two
    billion unbanked people?

- en: The failure rate of start-ups is high, and so we expect a good number of our
    case studies to fall by the wayside, not because blockchain technology is a bad
    idea, but because—for each one of our examples—there are many competing start-ups.
    All of them can’t survive. We believe those that follow Satoshi’s principles have
    a better shot than those that don’t.

    Revolution* as your playbook, sure, but realize also that the rules of the game
    themselves are changing. Think about your business, your industry, and your job:
    How will I be affected and what can be done? Do not fall into the trap brought
    about by many paradigm shifts throughout history. Today’s leaders cannot afford
    to be tomorrow’s losers. Too much is at stake and we need your help. Please join
