- en: There has been a large amount written and spoken about artificial intelligence,
    blockchain technology, and the implications that these technology tools will have
    on the accounting profession in both the near and long term. One just has to look
    at the frothy and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency, on top of the introduction
    of hundreds of new coins, for potential evidence of market conditions overheating.
    Such a large amount of analysis and speculation may appear to some as the symptoms
    and stages of a bubble or over excitement in the marketplace, but upon further
    review this does not appear to be the case. While technology has played an important
    role in the accounting and finance profession since the beginning of the computer
    age, there are several fundamental characteristics that differentiate these technologies
    from earlier iterations. What this book attempts to do, however, is to not only
    breakdown these sometimes amorphous technology concepts, but also analyze the
    implications of these technology tools and platforms, and to finally project possible
    implications of these tools on the financial services profession.

    depending on where you are reading this book from, might not even seem like worthy
    of an entire book in the context of blockchain technology. The majority of blockchain
    and artificial intelligence analyses have, instead, focused on the broad based
    implications of how these technologies will revolutionize not only business, but
    also society. Accounting and finance, despite the fact that they are only pieces
    of the broader economic and society, have an outsized impact on the economy and
    marketplace. The transmission of credit, safeguarding of information, and accurate
    reporting of financial information and data form the basis for how business decisions
    are made, both in local and global situations. Communicating this information,
    and doing so in an encrypted manner appears to be more important than ever in
    a world buffeted by data breaches and hacking; both technologies appear to have
    potential to facilitate this process.

    discuss these wide ranging implications and technologies, but to provide readers
    suggestions and guidelines moving forward. Put simply, blockchain and artificial
    intelligence  have the potential, and to a certain extent already are, transforming
    how the financial services industry engages with the business and stakeholder
    community. Taking a broader view of the accounting and finance industry, however,
    and the implications for improved communication, data management, and data encryption
    become clearer. Suggestions, recommendations, and insights connecting these technological
    forces with the current status of the accounting and finance fields form some
    of the key takeaways of this book. Regardless of what niche of finance or accounting
    readers you find yourself employed within, there are going to be applications
    and suggestions you will find helpful contained herein.

    that these technologies will have for the financial services profession and the
    individuals employed therein. With billions invested, and thousands of very smart
    and motivated people working on these solutions there will invariably be products
    and services that succeed in the marketplace, but there will also – without a
    doubt – have many false starts. As of the writing and editing of the book during
    2018 and 2019 there was already some speculation that perhaps the hype and excitement
    around cryptocurrencies and blockchain may have very well outpaced the functionality
    of the technology at this time. For example, an August and September 2018 issue
    of the Economist focused on the let downs and perhaps over excitement that has
    embraced the cryptocurrency and broader blockchain space. At the core of the idea,
    cryptocurrencies, including the headline generating Bitcoin, were started as an
    attempt to address what were perceived to be fundamental and core failings of
    the existing financial system. Namely, the centralized nature of transaction processing
    and data verification creates a scenario in which hackers and other nefarious
    market actors do not even have to search for where valuable data is stored. Rather,
    the very centralized nature of data storage and processing creates a scenario
    in which organizations are consistently put on the defensive, with a track record
    of consistent hacks and data breaches.

    ambition – to displace traditional fiat currencies such as the USD and Euro, due
    to price volatility, lack of efficiency with regards to transactions processing,
    and a lack of merchants willing to accept cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.
    That said, and even acknowledging the lack of applicability for currency purposes
    in the cryptocurrency marketplace, there is an appetite for investment in this
    space on the side of clients. Especially during the runup in price during the
    end of 2017, investor interest seemed to rise alongside the prices of Bitcoin
    and other various cryptocurrencies; financial professionals have a fiduciary duty
    to explain what exactly this means for investing and investment options. Put simply,
    accounting and financial services professionals must be able to offer objective
    and realistic advice in terms of both investing in these options as well as realizing
    just how much work is left to build out the technology in these spaces. Even as
    the cryptocurrency buzz and excitement has faded from the headlines alongside
    the drop in price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain has superseded
    many of the conversation in terms of excitement and investment.

    and that is the fact that does appear to be slowly entering the market conversation.
    Following the interest, investment, and dozens of conferences focused on blockchain
    applications across industry lines, the technology does appear to be entering
    the trough of disillusionment that often accompanies emerging technology forces.
    Numerous projects have been launched and funded, with IBM taking a leading role
    in assisting other organizations, but based on recent market evidence, the vast
    majority of these projects remain in pilot or beta phases. That said, there does
    remain a large amount of interest in this area which will invariably drive increased
    interest in the blockchain space at large. Understanding these emerging technologies,
    acknowledging the reality that many of these technologies are still in pilot or
    beta phases, and connecting these technologies to the financial services landscape
    are responsibilities every practitioner must understand and be aware of.

    dramatic increase in the price per bitcoin of 2017, but 2018 could be categorized
    as the trough of blockchain enthusiasm. Many of the programs that had been launched
    during the heyday of bitcoin euphoria during 2017 or during the initial part of
    2018 either remained in the pilot phase of production or had been cancelled altogether.
    Be it a result of the costs associated with implementing and maintaining blockchain
    systems, the complexity of integrating blockchain platforms with current ERP technology,
    or the fact that many blockchain based options are not as appropriate or efficient,
    many of the initiatives were cancelled or shelved during the year. This decline
    in interest and project progress was compounded by the dramatic collapse of cryptocurrency
    prices during the year, further fueling doubts of the validity or appropriateness
    of blockchain for enterprise based solutions. These are the facts on the ground,
    and as of this writing the price via cryptocurrencies seems to have stabilized,
    albeit at lower levels than those achieved during 2018 and 2019\. Even though
    blockchain projects and program continue to be launched, the focus of different
    blockchain projects and initiatives have diverted some exclusively cryptocurrency
    projects to those more enterprise based. Possibly not as scintillating as projects
    that are based around or connected exclusively to different types of cryptocurrencies
    these projects are increasingly connected to enterprise and industrial applications.

    broader perspective this transition and development tends to make sense from a
    financial and nonfinancial perspective. First introduced with collaborations and
    partnerships between international shipping organizations with spearheaded by
    IBM and Maersk, this coordination and associated efficiency gains created a possible
    paradox for the blockchain ecosystem. On one hand, the spectacular rise in the
    price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies did attract substantial investments
    and interest from individual and institutional players, including large amounts
    of coverage in mainstream media. Of course, and as usually occurs in the marketplace,
    and especially one such as nascent and emerging as blockchain itself, the dramatic
    rise in price of cryptocurrencies was only exceeded by the collapse of different
    cryptocurrency prices in 2018\. Mirroring the price action of different cryptoassets,
    the drop in price did lead to the cancellation, shelving, and postponement of
    numerous projects. Price targets and forecasts that had been made during the enthusiastic
    increase in prices were quickly revealed to have been made with incomplete information,
    or at the very least in the heat of the proverbial moment. Even as institutional
    fund flows continued to enter the space, including the establishment and refinement
    of, there was a sentiment that dominated the airwaves that perhaps blockchain
    was not all it was initially cracked up to be.

    when objectively analyzed and viewed in the face of just what is going on the
    blockchain ecosystem. Be it represented by advances in smart contracts, the rise
    of decentralized exchanges and other business models running on blockchain based
    solutions or applications, or the establishment of different payment options allowing
    cryptocurrency to be used. Additionally, the continued development and building
    out of non-bitcoin blockchains such as the Ethereum has allows the investment
    and development of a number of different options to enter the broader marketplace.
    For example, blockchain can be used as an infrastructure system and platform to
    either replace or substantially augment current enterprise systems, but that is
    only the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Healthcare, transportation and logistics,
    education, food safety and treatment, retail, intellectual property and intellectual
    assets all represent prime candidates for improvement via utilizing blockchain
    based solutions.

    technology itself, but the price declines that have impacted the marketplace during
    2018 should not dissuade either individuals or institutions from investing in
    more robust solutions. This book mentions and discusses cryptocurrencies, obviously,
    as they are (and will continue to have) an impact on the financial services space.
    That said, an appropriate way to think about the complicated relationship between
    cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and other enterprise applications is to imagine
    cryptocurrencies as one tool in the proverbial toolkit used by practitioners.
    Instead of focusing on the price action linked to different cryptocurrencies,
    the focus has continued to shift toward the enterprise applications for the technology
    itself. Interest and investment into differentiated blockchain technology solutions
    are already entering the marketplace, so it appears to merely be a matter of time
    before broad based enterprise adoption is fully underway.

    enthusiasm or buzz that may have been generated due to the numerous headlines
    lets take a look at some underlying themes that are holding true. That said, there
    is another fact that must be acknowledged before we dive headfirst into this rapidly
    moving and changing technology landscape. In order for financial services professionals
    to evolve and develop into the strategic advisor and business partner so often
    cited as the end goal for the profession the current level of technological integration
    is simply not enough. As the broader business landscape continues to evolve and
    shift at an accelerating pace, it is increasingly obvious a bifurcation is occurring.
    Within the financial services landscape, which includes everyone from CPAs to
    investment bankers, there are practitioners and firms who appear to be proactively
    moving toward where the landscape is shifting, and there appear to be practitioners
    who are not doing so. Although the transition may be challenging and difficult
    for some organizations and individuals, becoming future ready, or future proof
    is not something that can be perceived or evaluated as an optional task, or something
    that can delegated to a chief technology officer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather, the shift toward being future ready or future proof is one that may
    have been initiated by technology, but is much broader in scope. From Amazon to
    Tesla, customers and consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology, customized
    data, and real time analytics based on this information. Financial data, by contrast,
    especially the types of information that is reported to investors and the marketplace,
    has not changed with the rest of the business landscape. This would be a problem
    in any event, but is compounded by the following reality that has been enabled
    by the rapid technological integration of business at large. In many situations,
    especially as software and platforms become easier to use and more readily accessible
    in terms of cost, the necessity of employing a traditionally certified financial
    professional may be dropping. Of course, there are specific legal, reporting,
    and compliance based work that only a certified professional can perform (such
    as a CPA signing off on an audit), but analytics and forecasting can, and increasingly
    is, done by non-CPA, non-CFP, and non-CFA holding practitioners and firms.

    and powerful technology force the reality is that technology has, over the history
    of the accounting profession, played an integral role. Put simply, the modern
    accounting function and marketplace as it currently exists would not exist as
    it currently is constituted without the integration and implementation of various
    technology tools. That said, the integration and implementation of tools and platforms
    such as blockchain options and artificial intelligence represent a fundamental
    change in how accounting practitioners interact with the broader business landscape.
    While technology has been a part of the business environment since the development
    of computer options, the actual implementation of these tools has primarily been
    focused on automating and increasing efficiency of current processes. Process
    improvement, achieving increased efficiencies through technological augmentation
    of existing methods, and driving increased profitability as result are recognized
    as standard business practices across industry lines. That said, even as technology
    becomes increasingly integrated into how businesses operate and are evaluated
    by the marketplace, accounting firms and professionals appear to be playing the
    proverbial catch up game with regards to technology.

    leading organizations, including but not limited to Amazon, Google, Tesla, Tencent,

    both customer satisfaction and operational performance. Gathering information,
    making effective utilization of different sources of information, and being able
    to leverage this data to make better business decisions form the basis for possibly
    a sustainable competitive advantage. Information has been cited, in both practitioner
    and academic publications, as a potential source of competitive advantage moving

    valuable both to management professionals and the external users of said information.
    That said, the importance of effective data collection, reporting, and analysis
    appears to only have increased in value as increasing percentages of organizational
    value are tied up in intangible assets. Going by many names and iterations, including
    but not limited to intellectual property, intangible assets, and other data driven
    assets, it appears clear that the information produced by organizations can and
    should be leveraged to achieve business objectives. Drilling down, and reflecting
    on just how leading organizations operate and sustain leadership positions in
    the marketplace, the intersection between data and emerging technologies becomes
    clearer. Information, both quantitative and qualitative in nature at the inception
    of data generation, is coordinated, analyzed, and reported as a matter of business
    practice in any case. Extending this relationship, and focusing on the importance
    of using information to make decisions, both blockchain and artificial intelligence
    can assist management in more efficiently making use of organizational information.

    and qualitative in nature, it is also important that management professionals
    safeguard and protect these different sources of data. At this point, and prior
    to diving directly into both an in-depth analysis of technology options and a
    review of applications for the financial services industry as a whole, a brief
    overview and introduction of the different technology tools in marketplace appear

    conversation. Working off a common set of terminology and concepts is important,
    but especially important when discussing and examining relatively advanced and
    amorphous technology trends that include ideas like blockchain, cryptocurrencies,
    artificial intelligence, and the increased digitization of the accounting function.
    Second, laying the groundwork for the more advanced and in-depth conversation
    and analysis that will be a component of this text will help in reducing the hype,
    buzz, and subsequent confusion present all too often within the discussion surrounding
    rapid technological advancement. Drilling down, and understanding both the components
    of technology tools and the ramifications of these tools in a logical manner allows
    for a more substantive conversation focused on real world applications versus

    one of those scenarios. Some practitioners and commentators speculate that the

    view that is put forth by some in the financial services space. Automation, disruption
    of current roles and responsibilities are forces already underway in the marketplace,
    and have both created new jobs and roles as well as already eliminating other
    ones during the process. Even as some roles and tasks are automated, however,
    it is important to weigh the learning curve and obstacles that can hamstring and
    prevent the full on implementation and adoption of different emerging technologies.
    Budgets, the complexity of technology tools itself, and the difficulty of mapping
    and connecting new technology systems to current enterprise platforms all represent
    possible stumbling blocks that might slow the adoption and integration of technology
    overall. That said, and what this book attempts to cover and discuss, are both
    the technology tools themselves as well as the implications these tools will have

    of the current financial infrastructure. Second, as a decentralized application,
    especially in the case of Bitcoin which operates on a completely decentralized
    model, there is no single entity in charge of regulation, oversight, or enforcement.
    Put another way, there is no one or nothing in charge of resolving Bitcoin based

    managed, most traditional financial reporting is only applicable or of interest
    to creditors of equity shareholders. As stakeholders increasingly expect and require
    a broader array of information, including both financial and non-financial information,
    current accounting processes will have to be automated with technology and transitioned
    to a more continuous process.

- en: This entire text is dedicated to an in depth review and analysis of these technological
    forces, and just what these forces may mean for the financial services landscape
    moving forward, but it appears logical to frame the analysis upfront to focus
    the conversation and attention of the users of this text. Put simply, and regardless
    of what subset an individual practitioner finds themselves within, it is increasingly
    clear that current practices and processes will be insufficient moving forward.
    Automation, technological integration, and increasing competition from non-traditional
    areas are combining to create an environment in which financial services must
    adapt to keep pace and thrive moving forward. Financial services  , including
    but not limited to accounting, financial analysis, and banking related activities
    will need to evolve and change in the face of technological disruption.

    the only subjects to be discussed nor do they represent the totality of forces
    driving change within the profession. That said, and important to acknowledge
    at the beginning of this conversation, is that technology tools and platforms
    are enabling disruption and change at a pace unlike other disruptive trends that
    have previously occurred within the profession. Change, of course, is an inevitable
    part of business and of sector specific development, but the pace of change appears
    to be accelerating at a rate difficult contend with using traditional tools and
    processes.

- en: Chapter [1](467992_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml) forms the introduction and overview
    of the terminology and topics that lie at the center of this text, including not
    only the terminology and technical concepts, but also how these topics will connect
    to the financial services profession. Specifically, this chapter breaks down the
    technical topics and concepts – ranging from robotic process automation, to artificial
    intelligence, to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Reinforcing the appropriate
    definitions and terminologies associated with emerging technology is especially
    important for practitioners seeking to have intelligent conversations and debates
    around these topics moving forward. Bad information can cause even the most promising
    project to fail, and professionals must be able to objectively asses the viability
    and legitimacy of projects from both an operational and financial basis. On top
    of introducing the topics themselves, Chap. [1](467992_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml) also
    analyzes the topics and content in ways that are understandable and applicable
    for corporate practitioners. Instead of just focusing on technical, or jargon
    fueled definitions that focus on too much detail, this chapter lays the groundwork
    for the rest of the text by presenting these concepts in a manner that is understandable
    and useful for readers of this text. Technology will, and already is, changing
    the face of the financial services professional landscape, and are topics that
    every professional must understand and apply in order to service clients effectively.
