- en: With increased digitization, huge amount of data is being generated in relation
    to patient health information, electronic health records, Internet of things (IoT)-based
    health monitoring systems, insurance data and lot more. Blockchain 3.0 offers
    huge distributed storage space without much resources at your end, provides scalability
    without sacrificing security, helps integrating data from different sources without
    compromising privacy, delivers transparency without revealing ownerships, ensures
    interoperability without much complexities and establishes provenance with authenticity.
    Flexibility and multidimensional capability of blockchain technology offers a
    lot of potential for innovation, integration and sustainability in the healthcare
    space. Amalgamation of artificial intelligence, analytics and smart contracts
    helps leveraging core blockchain technology to create better value preposition
    for all the stakeholders vis-a-vis entire value chain of healthcare segment. This
    can be helpful in healthcare audits, clinical research, fighting counterfeit medicines,
    medical compliances, government regulations, drug supply chain management, claim
    settlements and many more.

    of Blockchain 3.0 implementation across entire value chain of the healthcare system
    and discusses the most important use cases that can lead to transformation and
    adds to the sustainability of the entire healthcare industry. This chapter discusses
    blockchain adoption journey from the technological perspective, viewpoint of challenges,
    implementation strategies and the way forward. This chapter presents how blockchain
    technology can impact and affect the broad segments of the healthcare space and
    improves sustainability. The first and most important use case explains how blockchain
    helps creating, exchanging and maintaining complete, accurate, secure and transferable
    healthcare records of patients with all compliances in-place. Smart contracts
    provide regulated and transparent access to data and can help conflict free faster
    claim settlement without the need of a middleman. Second use case explains how
    blockchain can help streamlining the processes of healthcare insurance companies
    and adds value to the patients as well as to the healthcare business. Blockchain
    along with artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics helps
    research and clinical trial management by way of drawing inferences from huge
    amount of data, fixing accountability and distributing research report in an efficient
    and cheaper way for faster and better scientific research outcomes. Third case
    study illustrates the use of Blockchain 3.0 for better management of clinical
    trials. The fourth use case explains how blockchain improves pharmaceutical supply
    chain management and mitigates the risk of counterfeit, fake and unapproved drugs
    and equipment. Of course the adoption of Blockchain 3.0 in medical segment is
    slow but the value addition offered by the technology to the sustainability of
    healthcare system have drawn the attentions of researchers, governments and healthcare
    companies to invest in this domain for a greater and better tomorrow.

    amount of data but the different stakeholders are unable to leverage the benefits
    because of various issues associated with sharing of data like integrity, privacy,
    security, authenticity and accountability. Blockchain by its very design addresses
    these challenges in an effective and efficient manner, and has proven implementations
    in the financial sector. Blockchain 3.0 with its extended functionality and rich
    APIs can transform the health sector by enabling effective collaboration, data
    exchange, mitigating data threats, automating back-office grunt work and improving
    revenue cycle management. Blockchain has the potential to add to the sustainability
    of almost all the verticals of healthcare sector like patient health records (PHRs),
    supply chain, clinical trials, health insurance, pharma R&D and so on. Indeed,
    Estonia has become the first country to adopt a blockchain-based healthcare system
    to ensure security and integrity of electronic health records (EHRs) of all of
    its citizens [[1](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_001)].

    for creation of the world’s first virtual currency – Bitcoin [[2](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_002)].
    It is a protocol to create a chain of blocks of transactions which are linked
    sequentially using cryptographic hash function of the previous block and uses
    digital signature to implement a trust less distributed ledger technology [[3](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_003),
    [4](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_004)]. Detailed underpinning of the technology is
    outside the scope of this chapter but we will introduce the concept and working
    of technology to understand its usage in healthcare domain.

- en: In simplest terms, blockchain is a shared ledger of blocks that contains the
    record of transactions which could be cryptocurrency, smart contracts, health
    information, insurance policy or any information for say. Each block along with
    transactions embeds in itself the message digest of previous block using cryptographic
    hash to ensure immutability. Each block is attached to the previous with the help
    of cryptographic protocols over a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network over
    the Internet [[5](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_005)]. Any transaction that takes place
    is signed by a private key to ensure privacy and nonrepudiation, and is broadcasted
    to the network. A mining node verifies this transaction, adds to a block and broadcasts
    to the network [[6](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_006)]. Network nodes verify the validity
    of the block using consensus protocol and known algorithms, for example, proof
    of work. Once the transaction block is validated, it is attached on top of the
    existing blockchain using cryptographic hash functions. Each block is time sequenced
    using timestamping and blockchain is updated by all the nodes on blockchain. Blockchain
    is not owned by anybody and it uses proven cryptographic techniques to embed privacy
    and trust; and allows each user to store, share and look into the block data.
    Different consensus mechanism and cryptographic functions can be used to address
    varied privacy, transparency and access usage.

    are met, and thus enhances efficiency, trust, transparency and real-time settlement
    without any dispute [[7](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_007)]. There exist smart contracts
    with different natures – deterministic and nondeterministic [[8](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_008)].
    Deterministic contracts have all the needed information on blockchain itself,
    whereas nondeterministic needs information from external data sources. Contract
    writing facility with first generation of blockchain, that is, Bitcoin is very
    limited whereas next-generation blockchains, for example, Hyperledger and Ethereum
    support fully customized smart contracts [[9](#b_9783110702507-007_ref_009)].
    Blockchain-powered smart contracts play a central role in eliminating third parties
    for verification, enforcing the terms and automating complex processes for data
    management.

    and billions of dollars every year. Interoperability enables different healthcare
    information systems and software applications to communicate, exchange and use

    information system to exchange the patient or clinical data with other system.
    Structural or level 2 suggests the structure of the data. It defines the formats
    and syntax that needs to the exchanged along with interpretation at the data level.
    Semantic or level 3 is the most complex level of the interoperability. It includes
    models, values of datasets, coding, rules of standard vocabulary and significance
    to the users. Top most level is organizational or level 4 that aims at addressing
    the legal aspect, governance and policies to ensure the secure and seamless exchange
    of data. This level also helps defining the workflows and trustworthy collaborations

    already been implemented by many stakeholders. The next phase is the seamless
    flow of the health related data among all the stakeholders but there exist three
    main challenges namely technical, marketing and systemic. Different EHR software
    follows different formats for storing records and making all of them compatible
    with each other is a big technical challenge. Integrity and privacy of the data
    is most crucial and interoperability may provide a single point of compromise.
    Also, hospitals and pathologies have already invested huge amount in legacy system
    and they are not willing to shed money further just for interoperability. Different
    EHR solution providers sell their proprietary systems with an array of features
    and services and interoperability dilutes their competitive edge. Intermediaries
    play a very significant role across the entire healthcare space and disintermediation
    is not easy. Also due to lack guidelines and framework, the governments are not
    in a position to enforce single interoperability standard.

    the rules for accessing of EHRs by different stakeholders. This helps fine-tuning
    who can access what and how long. Also, blockchain, by its nature, contains an

    for securing and making them visible to others. However, large data, for example,
    MRI image, slows down the processing speed and so smaller data is stored directly
    on-chain whereas large data is kept off the chain and a pointer to it can be saved
    on blockchain. An API can be written that facilitates fetching the data by smart
    contract. This APIs can be distributed to all participating nodes for enabling
    frictionless integration with existing digital systems. Similarly, another set
    of APIs can be used to query information from the blockchain. This API oriented
    architecture allows organizations to strengthen their internal system and desired
    data can be fetched automatically over the blockchain for ensuring interoperability.

    a smart contract only by a competent authority like FDA. Eligible party, like
    sponsors, can send a request to the smart contract for appropriate subjects matching
    based on genetic, demographic, therapeutic and geographic distribution. Once the
    eligible subjects are identified, trial process can move on with randomization
