    to deep learning technologies, have fundamentally transformed the digital data
    world, notably in the healthcare industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), blockchain, and deep learning (DL) technologies have all evolved
    in the recent decade and have piqued the interest of a variety of sectors ranging
    from industries to environment, wellness to health, commerce to service sectors
    The latest technological breakthroughs are allowing for new approaches to exploit
    untapped opportunities in mental healthcare. Inside this mental health care sector,
    the value proposition for blockchain technology is to securely transmit sensitive
    patient data among health care institutions while also empowering patients. The
    healthcare sector and related organizations have begun to adopt state-of-the-art
    technologies for value-based healthcare diagnosis, but there is still a long way
    to go because the challenges these organizations face are multidimensional and
    necessitate the use of appropriate techniques that cannot be trumped. The purpose
    of this article is to learn about the technology's fundamentals, the crucial impact
    it can play in the mental healthcare field, and draw attention towards the conceptual
    framework for secure mental health analytics to be practically worked upon soon.
    It is crucial to note that determining the entire benefits of blockchain at this
    time is difficult. We won't be able to arrive at a realistic conclusion on the
    technology's usefulness until and until it is widely adopted and employed.

- en: A wide range of complicated structured, unstructured, semi-structured, and heterogeneous
    data sources are included in today's growing mental healthcare intervention. Healthcare
    Quality Treatment has the largest market share globally, by 2022, revenues are
    estimated to reach USD 3,443.0 million. It has the opportunity to boost individualized
    care and generate $350 billion to $410 billion in yearly revenue by 2025, Furthermore,
    by 2025, it is expected that half of the healthcare applications (55%) will leverage
    blockchain for commercial purposes.^([1](#Fn1)) The value of the healthcare blockchain
    will increase to $5.61 billion by the same year, up from $170 million now [[1](#CR1)].
    These state-of-the-art technologies will not only facilitate the collection of
    patient-generated clinical health data but will also only improve early mental
    healthcare diagnosis and will enable mental health records to be safely shared
    across multiple platforms. This extremely sensitive and confidential mental health
    data can be safely exchanged across many domains and service providers, which
    will aid in the discovery of untapped possibilities and valued instincts [[2](#CR2)].

    is completely reliant on the dataset [[3](#CR3)]. With technology in place, clinical

    research is to make available the patient's critical reports to the physicians
    and psychiatrists that provide care. Patiotory tokens (POTY) are utilized to execute
    the blockchain for maximum security. Another model proposed addresses the security
    concern issue while exchanging patient information [[12](#CR12)]. The complete
    control is in the hands of the data owners. Policies are user-generated using
    smart contracts. Cryptographic keys are being used to protect information access
    and security while also monitoring any violations. HIPAA regulations are followed
    to provide data protection and user privacy. “(i) Users, (ii) Query Manager, (iii)

    analytics are that data is enormous and cannot be managed using traditional techniques,
    tools, or technologies as the data is unstructured, semi-structured, and sometimes
    structured and will continuously grow in three different blends, volume, velocity,
    and variety (commonly known as the 3 V’s in the big data world) [[4](#CR4), [19](#CR19)].
    Velocity represents the speed or rate of data, Variety focuses on different types.
    A few years back three V’s become the standard for the present definition of big
    data. Although, more V’s were added later to gain their full potential. Table
    [2](#Tab2) highlights the characteristics of data. The notion of Data as defined
    by Gartner has been refined from time to time by scientists, as data-intensive
    technologies are targeted to process high-volume to achieve value. Some of the
    emphasis lay down by different authors and the focus of that emphasis is depicted
    in Table [3](#Tab3) below. In terms of mental healthcare data is heterogeneous,
    incomplete, and is structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Structured data
    focus on genotype, genomics, phenotype, ICD codes [[7](#CR7)–[9](#CR9)], and unstructured
    includes clinical prescriptions, notes, diagnostic, lifestyle, health insurance,
    and economic data [[11](#CR11)]. The new era of mental health care is driven by
    an explosion of data that can be analyzed keeping in view privacy and security
    by increasingly powerful algorithms, tools, techniques, and number-crunching computers
    [[20](#CR20)]. Mental healthcare data can be analyzed in secure intelligent and
    innovative forms for sensitive data processing for enhanced secure insights and
    decision making. The major challenge is to deal with the privacy and security
    of personalized health data [[21](#CR21)]. The new dawn of mental healthcare paradigm
    shift has already started its journey where the focus is on value intelligence,
    Timely decisions, privacy, and security.Table 2

    of mental clinical data using blockchain. With dynamic population growth, pandemic,
    the rising level of mental health disorders, and escalating healthcare costs,
    complexities with inadequate technology are forcing healthcare stakeholders to
    rethink every aspect of health care from the rising volume of data to value-based
    healthcare in terms of privacy and security. The technological advancements and
    increased use of advanced secure analytical techniques are opening up potential
    breakthroughs in healthcare by moving towards high-value personalized patient-centric
    healthcare developments. However, at this point it’s up to the healthcare stakeholders

    protect the data. A hybrid design of databases and firewalls is implemented in
    the data gateways. The use of the MPC [[52](#CR52)] (Secure Multi-Party Computation)
    technique can provide a solution to enable computation over patient data without

    and synchronized with the cloud services which are then shared with the respective
    healthcare entities. A wide spectrum of devices like medical devices, wearable
    devices, and even manual input can be used to obtain data using the mobile application.
    A user-centric data model is used in the concept. The permissioned blockchain's
    membership system and channel creation are utilized to improve authentication
    mechanisms and personal privacy. Data integrity is ensured by the use of proof
    of integrity and validation. Batching and tree-based data processing techniques
    are utilized to make the application more scalable and performance reliable to

    allows for the immutable preservation of provenance data while also ensuring that
    any changes are traceably made to the data. The blockchain provides trustworthy
    information on how things work., who, and when things happen. When and where did
    the data come from? It has a lot of advantages. In medicine and mental health,
    there are numerous uses of this technology. Both patients and clinical psychiatrists
    could benefit from this technology by allowing them to maintain control over how
    their data is used and/or data annotations. It's also ideal for keeping patient
    information safe and secure for clinical usage to be distributed among multiple
    platforms. The community of mental health professionals should participate and
    collaborate in the design and development of blockchain technology to be used
    in research as well as patient care. No matter how promising the blockchain technology
    may sound, it is very difficult to initially move from the current healthcare
    systems to blockchain-based healthcare systems. The jumpstart requires a good
    amount of financial and technical bridge. Moreover, forming a consortium between
    various healthcare institutions is the most challenging part as no institution
    will agree upon giving up their business secrets. Another hurdle for this evolutionary
    idea is that it is based on cryptography, so, in case the owner of the data loses
    their private key, then the data will be lost forever, to prevent such scenarios
    more sophisticated encryption technologies like attribute-based encryption have
    to be implemented, which still need a lot of work to be fully implemented [[15](#CR15)],
