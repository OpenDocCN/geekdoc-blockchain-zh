- en: Modern state-of-the-art technologies, ranging from advanced statistical approaches
    to deep learning technologies, have fundamentally transformed the digital data
    world, notably in the healthcare industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), blockchain, and deep learning (DL) technologies have all evolved
    in the recent decade and have piqued the interest of a variety of sectors ranging
    from industries to environment, wellness to health, commerce to service sectors
    The latest technological breakthroughs are allowing for new approaches to exploit
    untapped opportunities in mental healthcare. Inside this mental health care sector,
    the value proposition for blockchain technology is to securely transmit sensitive
    patient data among health care institutions while also empowering patients. The
    healthcare sector and related organizations have begun to adopt state-of-the-art
    technologies for value-based healthcare diagnosis, but there is still a long way
    to go because the challenges these organizations face are multidimensional and
    necessitate the use of appropriate techniques that cannot be trumped. The purpose
    of this article is to learn about the technology's fundamentals, the crucial impact
    it can play in the mental healthcare field, and draw attention towards the conceptual
    framework for secure mental health analytics to be practically worked upon soon.
    It is crucial to note that determining the entire benefits of blockchain at this
    time is difficult. We won't be able to arrive at a realistic conclusion on the
    technology's usefulness until and until it is widely adopted and employed.

- en: A wide range of complicated structured, unstructured, semi-structured, and heterogeneous
    data sources are included in today's growing mental healthcare intervention. Healthcare
    Quality Treatment has the largest market share globally, by 2022, revenues are
    estimated to reach USD 3,443.0 million. It has the opportunity to boost individualized
    care and generate $350 billion to $410 billion in yearly revenue by 2025, Furthermore,
    by 2025, it is expected that half of the healthcare applications (55%) will leverage
    blockchain for commercial purposes.^([1](#Fn1)) The value of the healthcare blockchain
    will increase to $5.61 billion by the same year, up from $170 million now [[1](#CR1)].
    These state-of-the-art technologies will not only facilitate the collection of
    patient-generated clinical health data but will also only improve early mental
    healthcare diagnosis and will enable mental health records to be safely shared
    across multiple platforms. This extremely sensitive and confidential mental health
    data can be safely exchanged across many domains and service providers, which
    will aid in the discovery of untapped possibilities and valued instincts [[2](#CR2)].

    health data as a value driver is the most critical part of the digital healthcare
    industry nowadays. The preliminary stage of  collecting data and enhancing the
    entire lifespan until the withdrawal of it demonstrates how well the overall process
    is completely reliant on the dataset [[3](#CR3)]. With technology in place, clinical
    mental healthcare is moving away from simple analysis toward value-based analytics.
    With cryptocurrency surge interest in financial markets, blockchain technology
    has gained interest in other fields also especially in the healthcare service
    sector. Healthcare analytics combined with cutting-edge clinical healthcare technologies
    will open up a wide range of possibilities for the delivery of value-based care
    [[2](#CR2), [4](#CR4)].

    IoT, and AI, traditional healthcare definition is changing, thus making way for
    a new era of healthcare. A value-based solution will be more optimal if we have
    more open source secure mental healthcare data. As part of a data-driven healthcare
    strategy, collecting data, along with privacy and security, is imperative, and
    it will stay since the amount of data generated by healthcare organizations is
    enormous and provides a great deal of opportunity for improving healthcare. Effective
    use of this large pool of healthcare data will require the right analytical techniques,
    tools, and algorithms.

    road map for achieving this vision is still at a very early stage. An emerging
    question is whether the traditional clinical practice can be incorporated effectively
    with the use of data analytics technologies. The field of mental healthcare analytics
    is a relatively new one, so we tend to place technology in the hands of doctors
    and nurses to examine how to improve health outcomes and early intervention. Health
    interventions and diagnoses are reported in thousands of studies, each reporting
    feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. This is a critical component of
    making our future vision of health care a reality.

    the world whether developed or developing countries are moving from traditional
    healthcare clinical interventions to data-driven healthcare clinical interventions
    due to growing demands from stakeholders for early diagnosis and interventions. The
    present healthcare industry is enormous, encompassing a variety of sectors committed
    to the provision of healthcare services and products. Patients nowadays are seeking
    more privacy and confidentiality when it comes to information about their healthcare
    alternatives.

    due to the rising privacy issues and costs at an unsustainable rate, finding the
    right care has become unaffordable to the common man. In armed conflict zones,
    blockchain and other AI technology can help in creating secure valuable insights
    from mental healthcare data that will  not only help in avoiding stigma but will
    also help in remote monitoring to reduced healthcare disparity with privacy in
    place. For example, by analyzing the complex pattern from large structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured data for any specific disease or diagnosis or early diagnostic
    intervention, big data analytics, and blockchain can help reduction of privacy
    costs and will be equally very much effective in finding out secure generic versions
    of the drug discovery. Secure Predictive data analytics in healthcare can help
    out in identifying various meaningful patterns among people who suffer from similar
    illnesses.

    assembles, and distributes them. Network nodes verify the assembled transactions.
    The coordinating miner certifies the transaction at the signed transaction return
    phase, following which it is added and redistributed. The block's integrity is
    maintained by all nodes certifying it with at least one transaction. Decentralization
    is eliminated since the EHR's actual values are stored at a single point of failure.

    analytics are that data is enormous and cannot be managed using traditional techniques,
    tools, or technologies as the data is unstructured, semi-structured, and sometimes
    structured and will continuously grow in three different blends, volume, velocity,
    and variety (commonly known as the 3 V’s in the big data world) [[4](#CR4), [19](#CR19)].
    Velocity represents the speed or rate of data, Variety focuses on different types.
    A few years back three V’s become the standard for the present definition of big
    data. Although, more V’s were added later to gain their full potential. Table
    [2](#Tab2) highlights the characteristics of data. The notion of Data as defined
    by Gartner has been refined from time to time by scientists, as data-intensive
    technologies are targeted to process high-volume to achieve value. Some of the
    emphasis lay down by different authors and the focus of that emphasis is depicted
    in Table [3](#Tab3) below. In terms of mental healthcare data is heterogeneous,
    incomplete, and is structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Structured data
    focus on genotype, genomics, phenotype, ICD codes [[7](#CR7)–[9](#CR9)], and unstructured
    includes clinical prescriptions, notes, diagnostic, lifestyle, health insurance,
    and economic data [[11](#CR11)]. The new era of mental health care is driven by
    an explosion of data that can be analyzed keeping in view privacy and security
    by increasingly powerful algorithms, tools, techniques, and number-crunching computers
    [[20](#CR20)]. Mental healthcare data can be analyzed in secure intelligent and
    innovative forms for sensitive data processing for enhanced secure insights and
    decision making. The major challenge is to deal with the privacy and security
    of personalized health data [[21](#CR21)]. The new dawn of mental healthcare paradigm
    shift has already started its journey where the focus is on value intelligence,
    Timely decisions, privacy, and security.Table 2

    information safe and secure for clinical usage to be distributed among multiple
    platforms. The community of mental health professionals should participate and
    collaborate in the design and development of blockchain technology to be used
    in research as well as patient care. No matter how promising the blockchain technology
    may sound, it is very difficult to initially move from the current healthcare
    systems to blockchain-based healthcare systems. The jumpstart requires a good
    amount of financial and technical bridge. Moreover, forming a consortium between
    various healthcare institutions is the most challenging part as no institution
    will agree upon giving up their business secrets. Another hurdle for this evolutionary
    idea is that it is based on cryptography, so, in case the owner of the data loses
    their private key, then the data will be lost forever, to prevent such scenarios
    more sophisticated encryption technologies like attribute-based encryption have
    to be implemented, which still need a lot of work to be fully implemented [[15](#CR15)],
