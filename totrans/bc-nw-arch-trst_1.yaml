    the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, offers a detailed snapshot of
    societal trust patterns. The picture is not encouraging. Most of the trust indexes
    have been on a downward trend for some time. Recently, the erosion of trust has
    accelerated. The 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer report was entitled *An Implosion
    of Trust*.^([5](#chapter1-5)) Only 15 percent of the general population believes
    “the system” is working. The “profound crisis of trust” revealed in the survey
    is both deep and wide. It extends across all categories of institutions—including
    government, the media, corporations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)—and

    developing for many years. Two influential, best-selling books published around
    the turn of the millennium, Robert Putnam’s *Bowling Alone* and Francis Fukuyama’s
    *Trust*, warned of the fraying of societal trust. Using a blizzard of surveys
    and other research, Putnam highlighted the erosion of local trust networks in
    America, epitomized by the decline in bowling leagues relative to individual bowling.^([9](#chapter1-9))
    He viewed this as a pernicious development that explained the growth of social
    pathologies. Five years earlier, Fukuyama similarly had sounded the alarm about
    a crisis of trust globally, and particularly in contemporary America.^([10](#chapter1-10))
    Despite its reputation for rugged individualism, he pointed out, America actually
    benefited from high levels of interdependence. But that appears to be changing.
    The trust crisis that writers such as Fukuyama and Putnam warned of two decades
    ago is now a reality. The consequences may be dire.

    extend beyond the actuarial consideration of insurance costs. In game-theoretic

    vote many times because there is no central registry to verify their identity.

    example of the “horrors centralized services can bring,”^([1](#chapter3-1)) he
    quit the game and cast about for something else to spend his time on. He found
    Bitcoin. Although he was quickly hooked, Buterin thought digital currency was
    too limiting. As he recalled, “I went around the world, explored many crypto projects,

    If the block validation succeeds, the validator earns a reward. POS mimics the
    cost/benefit trade-off of mining, without all the processing. Instead of proving
    their commitment by dedicating expensive computing power, those who wish to validate
    blocks put resources at risk of slashing. POS thus relies on game-theoretic incentives

    to understand Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation was that he solved the problem of
    decentralized time-stamping. To trust that a coin was not spent twice, there must
    be a reliable way to track exactly when each transaction happened. On a decentralized
    network, however, there is no master clock to which every machine can synchronize.
    That would be a trusted third party!^([34](#chapter3-34)) And even without one,
    nodes would need to trust the time stamps that other nodes reported.

    existed.^([37](#chapter3-37)) His illustration was the humble vending machine.
    A vending machine fully executes a contractual agreement by taking in money and
    dispensing products. It also provides sufficient security to make breaching the
    contract—breaking into the machine—unprofitable. For all practical purposes, the
    machine is the entirety of the contractual environment. It needs no human intervention,
    either to perform the contract or to resolve disputes in court.

    machines work as proto-smart contracts because they sell items of low value, operate
    face to face, and take cash^([38](#chapter3-38)) (a bearer instrument). Distributed
    ledgers made it possible to implement similar arrangements digitally, across networks,
    for any kind of asset or agreement, without any trusted actor. For example, insurance
    agreements, mortgages, wills, and software licenses are all transactions that
    today require human intermediation, but could conceivably be automated through
    smart contracts. Even after Bitcoin gained strength, though, it took several years
    for robust smart-contract platforms to be introduced.

    the functionality necessary to support financial transactions. Adding richer programming
    capabilities to blockchain transactions adds security risks and various other
    complexities. The more you can do with a software-based system, the more opportunities
    for bugs, exploits, and hacks. Bitcoin also lacks a representation of shared state
    in the form of accounts, which specify cryptocurrency holdings at any moment.
    Instead, it uses a format called “unspent transaction output (UTXO).” The bitcoin
    associated with a private key need to be totaled up each time from previous sending
    and receiving transactions. UTXO is technically simpler for digital cash, but
    it makes it harder to operate general-purpose smart contracts.

    be executed on the distributed ledger through its consensus network.^([40](#chapter3-40))
    Ethereum is designed as a complete smart-contract platform, including development

    control of the keys reverted to the bank. The same thing would occur at the end
    of the lease term, unless the agreement was a lease to purchase, in which case
    the bank’s access would shut off upon full payment. Such a system would be designed
    to smooth enforcement of a familiar category of agreement. As will be discussed

    most valuable, after bitcoin. However, ether’s primary purpose is not to serve
    as an investment vehicle or payment mechanism. It is the only way to purchase
    an internal, nontradable resource in the Ethereum system, called “gas.” Gas buys
    processing cycles on the Ethereum network. A more complicated smart contract,
    requiring more computation, costs more gas. And there is a hard limit on the amount
    of gas that any Ethereum smart contract can expend.

    of computation. It would quickly clog up if anyone could launch thousands of smart
    contracts with no cost. Second, smart contracts are programs. They may have bugs
    or inefficiencies that eat up more computation than expected. Programmers can
    easily create infinite loops. A fundamental limit of a Turing-complete system
    such as Ethereum is something known as the “halting problem”: It is formally impossible

    services at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) in Los Angeles, the automaker’s in-house
    think tank. Coming from a background as a chief financial officer, he would seem
    an unlikely champion for decentralized blockchain technology.^([20](#chapter4-20))
    Yet it was in financial services—the complex and fragmented loan processes around
    cars—that he first recognized the potential of a shared distributed ledger. Now,

    road and determine how to respond. The more data fed into the systems from various
    driving situations, the more accurate the machine-learning results. The way to
    acquire that data is to send test cars into the field with human backup operators.
    Experts estimate that reliable autonomous cars that regulators will accept on
    the road will require 1 trillion miles of driving data to train the machine-learning
    engines. That is about one-third of all the miles driven in the United States
    in 2016.^([21](#chapter4-21))

    ones who want the data—autonomous car manufacturers—are not the ones who have
    the data. The ones who have the data—individual drivers and fleet operators—are
    extremely fragmented. And there is no marketplace for this latter group to use
    to sell their anonymized driving data if they wanted to. No one is in a position
    to create such a marketplace because neither drivers nor manufacturers would trust
    any one entity with their data.

    that a decentralized marketplace could establish property rights around user-driving
    data, secured through cryptocurrency tokens. Drivers would receive compensation
    for sharing their anonymized driving data with the marketplace, and car manufacturers
    would pay to access data from the same exchange.^([22](#chapter4-22)) The net
    result would replace the current system, where a central actor such as Google
    puts a swarm of research vehicles on the streets or buys data from fleets, with
    a decentralized market arrangement. For Toyota and other car manufacturers, this
    requires no great conceptual leap of faith. It is the same way that they buy other
    inputs to their vehicles such as steel. In economic terms, the distributed ledger
    aligns incentives between the erstwhile buyers and sellers of driving data. Toyota
    recently launched a consortium to advance the idea.^([23](#chapter4-23))

    that does not rely at its roots on sovereign authority is a powerful opportunity.

    create value by pulling together networks. Stock exchanges are a prime example.
    A few traders can negotiate with one another directly to consummate trades, but
    as the market expands, a purely person-to-person approach breaks down. Exchanges
    emerged as central aggregation points for trading, greatly increasing the liquidity
    of the market. Often, markets have multiple layers of intermediation, as new activity
    creates new service opportunities. The online advertising ecosystem is a good
    example. There is a complex assortment of advertising networks, tracking systems,
    retargeting services, aggregators, analytics providers, and other services. Each
    of these addresses an opportunity or pain point, often one that only developed

    tens of billions of dollars annually, represent a cost of intermediation. The
    benefit is that until Google came along, there was no way to bring the two sides
    of the market together effectively. But if the search engine advertising marketplace
    could exist without Google at the center, it would not have to bear those costs.
    And as the number of intermediaries multiplies, so does the overhead. Search engine

    sell tens of millions of dollars of inventory that they were simultaneously using
    as collateral for bank loans. Similar issues occur with uncertified parts. Even

    same result on decentralized networks.^([47](#chapter4-47)) To establish a viable
    currency, Bitcoin had to make it impossible to double-spend or to overwhelm the
    validation network with Sybil attacks. Once a token represents scarce value, however,
    it can be used as more than money. It becomes a cryptographically secured digital
    asset, or “cryptoasset.”^([48](#chapter4-48))

    earlier in this chapter. They can represent scarce digital entities, like the
    CryptoKitties collectibles described in chapter 2\. Alternatively, they can represent
    the utility of the network itself. For Bitcoin, money is the core application,
    so the network value is simply the price of all available bitcoin. For Ethereum,
    the value is its ability to create decentralized applications (Dapps) using ether
    to pay for the necessary gas to execute computations. More demand for Ethereum
    smart contracts, given limits on the supply of ether tokens, should increase the
    token price. The same is true for Dapps themselves.

    Users who provide personal information, validators who verify it, and large service

    in the form of Civic’s CVC tokens. These tokens can be used to pay for validating
    information (such as an employer checking a college transcript or a bank performing
    anti-money laundering checks) and other Civic services. The more activity on the
    network, the more the tokens are worth. When tokens can be traded on independent
    exchanges, their value will fluctuate based on traders’ expectations, but over
    time, the total value of tokens should converge to the value of the Dapp.^([50](#chapter4-50))

    that generates value. Just as a company can sell stock to the public to finance
    its operations, a Dapp could sell tokens. For a network, these could be created
    by “premining” a set number of coins, with additional coins created through a
    proof-of-work or similar process. Any desired set of rules could be established
    around the tokens with smart contracts, such as the four-year vesting schedule
    typical of stock options in private companies. By analogy to an initial public
    offering (IPO) of stock, token sales are often called “initial coin offerings
    (ICOs).”

    Ethereum created a standard called ERC20, as previously mentioned, which simplified
    the process of creating tokens based on Ethereum smart contracts. And a network
    of service providers, hedge funds, legal experts, and others emerged to help projects

    (BATs), which can be used to pay publishers in lieu of advertisements. The token
    sale sold out in a matter of minutes, raising ether worth $35 million at the time.
    Bancor, which makes it easier to exchange cryptocurrency tokens for one another,
    raised the equivalent of more than $150 million a few days later. Tezos, which
    developed a new blockchain network based on flexible governance, topped that with
    an ICO generating more than $230 million at the time. And Filecoin, which is building
    a distributed cloud storage network, raised more than $250 million between tokens
    sold to the public and presold at a discount to partners. All told, there were
    more than 50 ICOs in 2017 that raised at least $30 million.^([53](#chapter4-53))

    economic and legal uncertainty of the concept and the absence of any need for

    billion-dollar valuations, the justification for which was often difficult to

    a limited inventory of investments available to the public, and great uncertainty
    about the future, it is easy for the market price of a token—what someone will
    pay for it—to become detached from any rational assessment of its real worth—the
    discounted value of future activity on the network. Such gaps are endemic to financial
    markets. Market-makers and arbitrageurs use breaks between trading and real values
    as money-making opportunities, and in so doing move markets toward the “correct”
    price, a process known as “price discovery.” That is how things work in theory.
    In practice, though, there are many opportunities for abuses that harm investors,
    giving rise to a large body of financial regulation. The legal and regulatory
    status of token sales will be discussed in chapter 9.

    Protocols need a critical mass of users to generate positive network effects.
    For a new protocol, it may be difficult to compete against incumbents or simply
    to get off the ground. Venture capitalists are looking for businesses that can
    scale fast and produce “home run” returns, which isn’t always the right model
    for a start-up. “The biggest challenge of building a network business is the bootstrap
    problem,” says venture capitalist Chris Dixon.^([58](#chapter4-58)) Brave and
    Civic both received traditional venture capital funding, but they also issued
    tokens to capitalize on their other benefits.

    their attention and content to Facebook, but they receive none of the economic
    benefits that Facebook generates as a result. If Facebook were organized around
    an appcoin, users could share the benefits as token prices appreciated—at least
    in theory. The potential value of a token could also provide incentives for users
    to engage with what could become the next Facebook. Early adopters and strong
    believers in new platforms would be encouraged to get in early, when the token
    price was low. In contrast to traditional venture capital funding, which does
    not provide a “liquidity event” until the company is sold or goes public, the
    token sale model allows immediate translation of investments into a currency.

    other than Bitcoin itself are operating on a sufficient scale to drive the value
    of their tokens based on actual utility. Most of the ICOs launched so far are
    for services that are not yet operational. Some will never succeed in launching
    a production network. Even the ones that reach that point may not attract a substantial
    number of users. Just because something *can* be tokenized does not mean that
    it *should* be. Where the model makes sense, however, it has the potential to
    change the way that start-ups are funded and grow.

    cryptoasset marketplace tied to an external cryptoeconomic security system (the
    blockchain network). Most Dapps outsource the cryptoeconomic verification by operating
    on top of an infrastructure platform such as Ethereum. That still leaves significant
    challenges. In OpenBazaar’s case, the biggest reason for forgoing an ICO was that
    it does not need an internal token to motivate behavior. As an eBay-like marketplace,
    it already has an economy: exchanging goods for money.'

    Before ICOs, the primary example of services powered by user-owned private currencies
    were online games that offered virtual coins to purchase goods or gain abilities.^([60](#chapter4-60))
    The virtual goods model powered the rapid growth of gaming companies such as Zynga
    and Supercell. But it also created problems, such as overreliance on high-spending
    “whales” and vulnerability to fickle user tastes, as shown when Zynga’s usage
    (and subsequently the stock price) collapsed. Operating a company in thrall to
    a market price that you do not control is not a simple matter. Token issuers typically
    have some power to adjust the exchange rate of tokens for services on the platform,
    but if they go too far in devaluing the tokens, users will revolt.

    it? Facebook could issue virtual credits that users could purchase as an alternative
    to viewing advertisements. In fact, Facebook did try to do this. In 2009, Facebook
    Credits was created as a token system for virtual goods in games operating on
    Facebook. It shut down in 2012 because Facebook did not see the advantage of operating
    its own internal currency.^([61](#chapter4-61)) Users also found it simpler to
    purchase virtual goods in the native virtual currencies of each game, on which
    Facebook could still charge a tax.

    by extracting value from its network. Its business model is incompatible with
    a fully tokenized structure, in which value resides in the network. This creates
    opportunities for competitors built around token economies. However, those competitors
    face the same trade-offs. And while Facebook would have to change its business
    model, established platforms such as Amazon Web Services that already charge for
    services might have an easier time coopting the token model if competitors show
    its value.
