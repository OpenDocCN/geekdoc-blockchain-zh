    months ago.” She dropped a ream of papers on his desk. “Here’s all the paperwork.”

    years of business financials, personal tax returns, home appraisal? Why do you
    need our home appraisal?”

    need the credit extension. We’ve got expenses—which we pay on time—but then your
    bank takes forever to pay our agency. So we’re floating you the money. Does that
    make sense?”

    payment, but that’s—”

    the line of credit—”

    having problems with our organization,” Sean said, trying to soothe us. “And this
    approval has taken way too long. I can see you’re good customers, with a growing
    business. Let me go check with my manager to get this expedited.”

    contracts. We call them smart contracts because they are programmed to work without
    a lawyer. I will describe a smart contract as simply as possible, using balloon
    animals.

- en: Let’s say you hire a balloon-animal artist for your kid’s birthday party. This
    guy is amazing. He’s done balloon animals for the prime minister of Canada, and
    he’s the personal balloon-animal artist for Bruno Mars. Very expensive, but he’s
    not just twisting dogs. He’s doing werewolves and stuff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because he’s in such high demand, you don’t know if he’ll actually show up.
    The balloon guy might be in Hawaii at his spiritual retreat. He charges 10 bitcoin
    per appearance, so you send 10 BTC to a smart contract—like a holding account.
    You send it to an address (like an email), and it’s recorded on the blockchain
    (the Great Checkbook in the Sky).

- en: Let’s say your balloonist doesn’t show up. Jeff Bezos has hired him for the
    evening. The smart contract is not fulfilled, and the money is sent back to your
    bitcoin account automatically. The kids are disappointed, but you are able to
    book David Blaine instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let’s say he does show up. The kids are delighted. He creates a geodesic
    dome of balloon animals, inside of which children can view significant moments
    of your child’s life, lovingly constructed in balloon artistry and thoughtfully
    illuminated with hanging balloon fixtures.

- en: At the end of the evening, he holds out a code for you to scan on your phone.
    This is an “all clear” for the smart contract to release the bitcoin to his account.
    It’s as if you held the 10 BTC in escrow, and this releases the escrow—except
    that escrow requires a third party to hold the funds. This doesn’t.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Could you refuse to scan the code? Sure, just like you could refuse to release
    an escrow payment—in which case the money sits in escrow, unavailable to either
    of you. With a smart contract, though, the money in dispute could be forwarded
    to a network of independent arbitrators who decide how much the balloon guy gets
    paid. (And they receive a cut of the payment for their time.)

    want it to pop. If you can picture a digital contract that requires both parties
    to fulfill their end of the bargain without a middleman, you have the idea.

    we’ve never met—in the same way Airbnb allows us to safely sleep on the sofas
    of strangers. We trust our neighbors not to run us over every time we get in a
    car. Blockchain is simply widening this circle of trust.
