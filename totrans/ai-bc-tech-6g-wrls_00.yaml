    and interdisciplinary fields such as Medical Science, Applied Mathematics, Environmental
    Science, Business Management, and Computer Science. It covers an in-depth knowledge
    of blockchain technology for advance and emerging future technologies. It focuses
    on the Magnitude: scope, scale & frequency, Risk: security, reliability trust,
    and accuracy, Time: latency & timelines, utilization and implementation details
    of blockchain technologies. ​While Bitcoin and cryptocurrency might have been
    the first widely known uses of blockchain technology, but today, it has far many
    applications. In fact, blockchain is revolutionizing almost every industry. Blockchain
    has emerged as a disruptive technology, which has not only laid the foundation
    for all crypto-currencies, but also provides beneficial solutions in other fields
    of technologies. The features of blockchain technology include decentralized and
    distributed secure ledgers, recording transactions across a peer-to-peer network,
    creating the potential to remove unintended errors by providing transparency as
    well as accountability. This could affect not only the finance technology (crypto-currencies)
    sector, but also other fields such as:'

- en: The initiatives in which the technology is used to distribute and trace the
    communication start point, provide and manage privacy, and create trustworthy
    environment, are just a few examples of the utility of blockchain technology,
    which also highlight the risks, such as privacy protection. Opinion on the utility
    of blockchain technology has a mixed conception. Some are enthusiastic; others
    believe that it is merely hyped. Blockchain has also entered the sphere of humanitarian
    and development aids e.g. supply chain management, digital identity, smart contracts
    and many more. This book series provides clear concepts and applications of Blockchain
    technology and invites experts from research centers, academia, industry and government
    to contribute to it.
