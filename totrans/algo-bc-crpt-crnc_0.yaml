    work is eventually broken down into its constituent microtasks and that as these
    tasks become simpler and simpler, the skill set required to do them becomes less.
    As such, the eventual and inescapable conclusion is that there will be little
    to no specialisation as we currently recognise it and that virtually any task
    could be completed by virtually any individual. Complex microtasks can emerge
    from the ABC economy, but again, they will be broken down to simpler forms.

    completed by any individual to the same standard, then organisations need to only
    pay subsistence wages (or less) to get the microtask completed. This assumes though
    that the power relationships between the organisation and the Bitworker are weighted
    in favour of the organisation. In a microtask world, with the predicted increase
    in the volume of microtask, there will be few (if any) microtasks which will be
    standalone consequential for the Bitworker. In any economy, there are usually
    more workers than work hours to be completed, in a microtask economy this could
    very well be the other way around. Microtasks are expected to increase in number
    following the exponential pattern of the increase in computer power, worker numbers
    (even in the global ABC economy) following the pattern of human procreation are
    not expected to match this growth.

    challenge our understanding of what an organisation even is. We could move between
    dystopian notions of omnicorporations, positive and negative views of global governments
    coordinating all economic activity, or anything in between. For the purposes of
    this book, and remembering that the future we are proposing isn’t too distant,
    being the culmination of existing technologies and trends discussed in [chapter
    1](CH001.html), we need to assume that in terms of organisation the ABC future
    will look broadly similar to today. In a later chapter, we note that the effect
    of the ABC economy on national government and regulation may be much more significant
    than on the organisations, especially organisations which are already hyper-global.

    down to fundamental microtasks, where blockchain via smart contracts is providing
    certainty and security for input and output relationships between organisation
    and worker, and is providing instantly transparent and verifiable information,
    and where cryptocurrencies are facilitating global payments, We first need to
    look into the past. There are striking parallels between the ABC future and the
    First Industrial Revolution. We note that these discussions are ongoing, but that
    there are many comparisons between today’s age alteration, the current threat
    to AI and automation policing jobs and activities and the disintermediation potential
    blockchain. However, throughout this book, we strive to develop a future where
    the individual technological trends and supertrends have converged and created
    a potential future greater than the reach of any single technology. We believe
    that this future can be analysed through the lens of the Industrial Revolution,
    as a societal, economic and political transformations of work, can in fact in
    a broadbrush sense, be looked at in some ways is a removal of some of the constraints
    placed on workers by, in particular, the factory system, and we will argue this
    in some ways the ABC may represent societal transformation to a world of work
    with more freedom.

    benefit to society. However studies must also consider the long-term environmental
    effects, and whether some of the benefits accrued owing to the Industrial Revolution,
    quite simply, were economic output benefits generated from stealing the future.
    A key consideration is that whilst the Industrial Revolution was undoubtedly long-term
    economic benefits, the main question of course concerns the short-term effects,

    traditional skills, with skills they need to compete in the workforce. In the
    long-term, we have argued that the notion of skills, of specialisms, or even of
    professions, may be a redundant concept. One of our key arguments of the process
    of AI, machine learning and algorithms reducing work to its fundamental microtasks,
    is in fact a diminishing of the skills required to complete them. However, as

    the elites. Workers feared for their livelihoods and lifestyles and mass unemployment
    of workers and subsequent societal unrest. The Industrial Revolution occurred
    in the UK, when the landed elite was supplemented by the industrial elite, who
    had much to gain from mechanisation. The long-term economic gains of industrialisation
    would not necessarily felt that the workers of the Industrial Revolution. In the
    Industrial Revolution, notions of time, money and work were completely transformed;
    in Britain in 1770, most of the population could not even conceive of the idea
    of a factory, let alone working in one, but by 1830 millions of the population
    did. This societal shift changed the fundamental bedrock of the pre-industrial
    society, in particular, the idea of time. Prior to industrialisation, a craftsmen
    worked from home on their own machines and generally sold their outputs at a weekly
    market. Craftsmen knew there was only one thing to get the job done and they could
    work when they liked. They often worked long hours but they had total control
    over it and freedom that came with it. For this work, they earned middle incomes
    and had a reasonably comfortable traditional lifestyle, very similar to their
    parents and the generations that came before them. Then came mechanisation of
    factories, craftsmen simply couldn’t compete, factories in Adam Smith’s notions
    of specialisation to rapidly increase output. Craftsmen taking the whole product
    was not able to compete, for instance weavers in the Industrial Revolution saw,
    over a 30-year time period, their average wage falling from around 20 Shillings
    a week to around 5 Shillings. Traditional workers could not make sense of the
    factory system. They were being paid to work for a certain amount of hours or
    days, they were being paid for one process and not seeing the output they were
    creating. Ideas of money transferred from outputs to time, machines ran at constant
    levels of outputs and so you were paid for keeping the machine going for a certain
    period of time, again wholly unfamiliar concepts to the craftsmen. Previously,
    the idea of time was simply an endpoint which craftsmen had to get the output
    done by, now it was a regimented broken down technical process which resulted
    in less control, less freedom and less pay. This was a large structural change
    in society, and society needed to be prepared for the new mechanisation world.

    per capita income globally doubled roughly every 6000 years. Since the Industrial
    Revolution per capita income doubles every 50\. Longer term the Industrial Revolution
    was beneficial to the workers and society, but in the short term it was not. However,
    this time around workers can better see the effect of technology on the demand
    for their labour, the democratic system gives workers a voice today that they
    were working in the Industrial Revolution. The labour replacing technology is
    here and is faster and further developing, society is reacting. Andrew Yang is
    running for president, and a campaign to protect jobs from automation, regulation
    and policy can be conceptualised as a response to automation, as can presidential
    success in campaigning to bring jobs back. In 2013, Frey and Osborne found that
    47% of American jobs are at high risk of automation, we would suggest that risk
    increases with every technological development. So, the question we have to ask
    is will the ABC destroy jobs and will it, for those jobs are destroyed, create
    replacements?

    and displacement. We are entering a new freeze in the global economy, where big
    tech is rebuilding, reshaping and redesigning traditional systems. Earlier in
    the book, we looked at the journey of finance from traditional institutions and
    notions of finance, to the disruption of FinTech. We can conceptualise this journey
    to the ABC economy, in much the same way. We see TechFin as the final stage in
    this system, a new way of coordinating and generating financial activity, which
    will be replaced by the next systemic development. Likewise, we can conceptualise
    the journey of our economy, from a traditional capitalist system which innovates
    and reinvigorate itself, to automated and knowledge-based economy which shares
    the same foundations, structures and institutions, but with technology making
    the systems become more efficient, which in turn gets replaced, as technology
    doesn’t simply make existing systems more efficient, but wholly reinvents them.
    For a short-term journey than, we can learn lessons both from the Industrial Revolution
    and from much more recent history of automation and industrial decline. We can
    see how in particular, middle income wages can decline, and how those displaced
    by new technology, rarely regain the standards of income and security they had.
    Here of course is one barrier in the way of the eventual ABC economy, in a way
    that seemed unlikely even a few years ago, automation anxiety has entered the
    mainstream debate. Technology taxes and support packages for displaced workers
    are becoming common themes in political dialogues.

    the ABC economy, significant protections are required for labour, to prevent a
    repetition of that earlier Frey quote, that on the journey to the societally distributed
    (though of course not equally) economic benefits of industrialisation, one, two,
    three or more generations of workers are not worse off. These protections, including
    improved welfare, potentially universal income and advanced and dynamic lifelong
    learning are discussed in the later chapters. Here we see great potential in new
    technology redesigning the world of work, the journey to get there without government
    intervention and policy protections could be comparable to a negative journey
    of workers in the Industrial Revolution. We hope that this book provides a guide
    both for workers and policy how to mitigate this.

    broken down to microtasks, with blockchain providing a platform for verifiable
    transparent information and corporate-cryptocurrencies meaning that we can accept
    payments for work from hyper-global organisations, with borderless, real time
    and infinitely divisible instant transactions. We can see that this is a future
    where the world of work could look very different. If our existing notions of
    long-term employment, if not a job for life, with specialisms or skills that we
    trade for income, our human and social capital are all fluid ideas, how does one
    prepare for a world where work is constantly changing where the microtask you
    may be adept or highly skilled at disappears. Where the ideas of machine learning,
    big data and advanced analytics take our successful completion of a task process
    and replicate that successful completion and replicate the required skill set.
    What then does the worker in the ABC economy do to prepare to train? Ultimately,
    we need to examine the very notions of education, schooling, training, Further
    Education, Higher Education and developing proficiencies in one or two complementary
    areas and look further towards fundamental skill sets that can be used in the
    completion of a large range of processes and tasks. Total flexibility and adaptability
    is required to provide the outputs needed in the ABC economy, but the fundamental
    question is how to prepare a workforce for this. Instead of training programmes,
    schooling or university degrees in each of the themes we discussed earlier, it
    may be instead of becoming a composer, or an architect, or a web designer, one
    simply becomes a creative. Somebody specialising in coding, or accountancy, or
    banking, do they become a technical and so likewise, do the workers in the physical
    sphere simply train their bodies to become as close to autonomous production styles
    as possible? This will probably be required where the human physicality needs
    to complement and suit a range of autonomous microtasks. One can imagine a future
    where the ability of a physical worker to match their approaches to algorithms
    would be highly prized.

    Online Courses (MOOC)-type sphere.

    to support the advertising of their latest product, may require creative microtask
    completed within the attributes of that firm or for general car selling, that
    may in turn require a bit worker to undertake a significant amount of online courses.
    This training, one would expect, following the pattern of the ABC economy to reduce
    processes down to fundamentals, would be quick and concise, and designed to provide
    the human with the skills the algorithm needs. Potentially, with a nod to the
    system and structure we currently have, enough microtask training could accredit
    someone as a BA (Hons) Creative, BSc (Hons) Technical, etc.

    in the ABC economy, a worker that we call the Bitworker, and one that positively
    interacts with the technological, online and economy. We wish to make it clear
    that we are not prophesying things or predicting the future. The ABC economy and
    the bit worker within it are, we think, possible futures, or possible scenarios.
    It is a fool’s errand to make direct predictions, the one prediction we can relatively
    confident of is that the future as presented in this book, will not look exactly
    like our writings. We are aiming to give an idea of the future of work and the
    future of working in a heavily automated, artificial intelligence (AI), algorithmically
    driven and Blockchain supported future. We hope scholars and practitioners and
    future workers themselves will continue to explore the themes presented. This
    is not the precise future, or even necessarily a probable one, we have looked
    at many aspects of regulation, policy and adaption to this technology, which will
    be required to provide a future similar to what we present. Even when we proposed
    this book, the development of technology has continued to outpace government and
    regulation. We can see anxiety around automation entering into the mainstream
    political debate, workers’ worry for their livelihoods is entering into the political
    discourse. Their arguments being presented around the nationalisation of large
    firms, to protect them (or to protect the worker) from further automation, proposes
    that taxes on robotics, popular warnings against the destructive potential of
    AI (both in the traditional sense and the employment sense), an unexpected election
    and referenda outcomes, which can be traced back to the correct idea of those
    left behind politically and economically, but primarily by the middle income lifestyle,
    being replaced by automation. The political will, protections and support, we
    have argued unnecessary to turn what we have termed the ABC economy, into their
    benefit for all, were not present in these communities or happenings. Workers
    displaced by automation, and an increasing pace in technological developments,
    were not offered sufficient welfare, credible training to regain skills to enter
    the new workplace or even psychological support. Workers in the left behind areas
    and industries rarely regained what they lost. In our future, we are suggesting
    displacements on a massive scale, and policy consideration needs to be given to
    ensure that the potential upside for all, this technological development, is not
    squandered. It is all too easy, too. The future where increasing automation (at
    least in the short term) gives rise to greater profitability and greater inequality.

    structures being replaced by new technological ones. Returning to our analogy
    from finance and banking, of (1) traditional institutions, moving to a (2) FinTech
    system which in turn moves to (3) a TechFin system. Remember crucially, whilst
    the aims of one and three are the same, the structures and processes and operations
    of three are unrecognisable to one. If we consider the post-Industrial Revolution
    to structure of economic output to akin to stage I, that is the traditional financial
    institution, we can see that, the stage roughly from 1967 (with the launch of
    the first handheld calculator, and thus the precursor to today’s smart phone)
    to the near future. Stage II is that of FinTech, where often significant technological
    innovations are driving efficiencies and productivity in broadly the traditional
    institutions structure. Then we can postulate a future stage akin to TechFin,
    which results in a potential future characteristics not dissimilar to those described
    in this book. Of course, the journey of activity is dynamic, and we are not suggesting
    that our TechFin stage is the last one, this will probably be a continual journey
    based around the circular pattern of traditional institution, technological efficiency
    to that system, and then fundamental structural developments occurring to produce
    a new system of output, activity and coordination.

    or as we term them, the ‘Bitworker’, in this new global economy. We use the phrase
    global economy as we believe that, with a small number of geographic and physical
    barriers, this new platform-based way of working, will be as global as we can
    conceptualise. The sellers of online work, the organisations, governments and
    cooperatives of the future could, in effect, be located anywhere or nowhere and
    be online entities with zero physical infrastructure or human infrastructure,
    a further headache for the state and a huge consideration for future research.
    In effect, a Bitworker in the UK could be working for anyone, and ultimately we
    doubt they will even know who they are, with trust in the platform, facilitated
    by blockchain smart contracts and globally acceptable cryptocurrencies, supporting
    this. The technological infrastructure to support this way of working, already
    exists; blockchain and cryptocurrency simply make it easier to do. In a world
    where the process to produce an output or service is reduced to its component
    or fundamental process, it is a reasonable judgement that the skill set required
    to produce this output decreases (as the number of microtasks increases). This
    is the specialisation of which we are already familiar but sped up and ruthlessly
    efficient. This chapter explores how in a world where skill need decreases, a
    worker is still able to thrive and differentiate themselves. We draw parallels
    with the wholesale changes from pre-industrial to industrial worker and query
    if in some ways the ABC marks a return to a quasi-pre-industrial style of working.
