    cryptographic field from its inception in the 1980s. But still there is an open
    space for the verification of data without a trusted third party in e-cash systems.
    Nakamota initiated Bitcoin in 2009 [[1](#re_TNF-CH007_CIT00001)]. This new brand
    of e-cash has received attention because of the following properties. They are
    decentralization, unforgeability, and pseudonymity [[2](#re_TNF-CH007_CIT00002)].

    This began after Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper which states that the first Bitcoin
    was mined in 2009\. It was an alternative to P2P currency. More varieties of cryptocurrencies
    started to be introduced to the market soon after the recognition of Bitcoin.
    Blockchain is the backbone technology for the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
    Blockchain is termed as a decentralized information-sharing platform for computation.
    This enables transactions between different authoritative domains that do not
    trust each other. They collaborate, cooperate, and coordinate with each other
    [[3](#re_TNF-CH007_CIT00003)].

    The ledger information can be seen only by those who are authorized to see.

    A and B want to transfer/transact money from one account to another account. In
    a normal scenario, friend A first approaches the bank and asks the bank to transfer
    the amount to the account of his friend B. This transaction detail is entered
    into the bank registry that is maintained by the bank. This entry needs to be
    updated on both the sender’s and receiver’s accounts. But the problem in this
    system is that the entries can be easily manipulated or changed by those who are
    have knowledge about the system. It is easily changeable. This process has been
    diagrammatically specified in [Figure 7.1](chapter7.xhtml#fig7.1) [[1](#re_TNF-CH007_CIT00001)].
    This is the place where blockchain comes into the picture to resolve this issue.

    This sheet can be shared with multiple users through networks of computers. The
    users can access this transaction but no one can edit it easily. The spreadsheet
    is organized as rows and columns and it is treated as blocks in blockchain. A
    block represents a collection of data in the blockchain. The data get added to
    the block in chronological order by creating a chain of blocks that forms a link.
    The first block in the blockchain is called the genesis block.

- en: Blockchain is developed in such a way that it’s called a digital ledger. This
    digital ledger is duplicated and distributed to thousands of individual computers
    across the world. These are called nodes, and the interactions between these nodes
    are periodically updated to the ledger. Each user is given access to a public
    and private key. These two are the cryptographic keys and are secured one. They
    allow limited interaction with the system. For example, if there are two users
    and they agree on an exchange of Bitcoin currency, a particular user can initiate
    the transaction using their public and private keys. The other user can accept
    the transaction using their own public and private keys. Both users can submit
    the transactions to the P2P system.
  prefs: []

- en: A unique hash code present in the block checks the transaction information so
    as to ensure that the transaction agrees with all other prior information. It
    may deny the transaction if the initiating user does not have the cryptocurrency
    that they claim for. Otherwise this checking node accepts the transaction and
    it is added as a new block in the chain.

    network. Administrators will grant the reading request and consensus request to
    a limited set of trusted nodes who can take part in consensus execution. It is
    much faster in accomplishing things, and there is no single point of failure.
    For example, the world’s top 20 financial institutions are grouped under one consortium.

    a fixed-length hash as output, and it takes an input string of any length. Transactions

    data and a hash pointer that points to the previous block. A hash pointer is a
    kind of pointer which points the hash value of data, i.e. present inside the previous
    block. This property makes blockchain immutable and amazingly reliable. If anyone
    tries to change a single bit of data in block 4, it is reflected in a huge change
    in the data stored in block 3 and in turn it affects the data stored in block
    2 and it continues further. The change in hash value is used to find whether the
    transactions are altered by any means. But it is completely not possible based
    on the property of hash.

    it can provide in a network. Another important aspect of blockchain technology
    is the degree of privacy that it can provide. Transparency is basically concerned
    with the quality of being clear and understandable without ambiguity. What happens
    actually is blockchain hides the user identity by using complex cryptography algorithms.
    So while looking for a particular transaction record it does not look like “alice
    sent bob 2btc” in the original record. Instead it will look like encrypted content
    “2BM2hdskjfhdfgRvndkERFVbjb237bu sent 2 btc”.

    companies that do transactions using their cryptocurrency. But the big financial
    companies won’t perform all their transactions using cryptocurrency. The big boom

    data if they don’t possess the key. This is because all the transactions are timestamped
    and signed using digital signature algorithm which ensures non-repudiation. So

- en: The problem in blockchain privacy is the leakage of transactional privacy data
    because the details and the balances of public keys are visible to all in the
    network. Anonymity in blockchain is classified into mixing solutions and anonymous
    solutions. Mixing is a kind of service that offers anonymity by transferring funds
    from multiple inputs addressed to multiple output addresses. Anonymous is another
    type of service which unlinks the payment origin for a particular transaction.
    It stops the intruder from analyzing the transactional data.

    Every node should store the copy of the transaction to validate the data. First
    the transaction source needs to be validated before the transaction is validated.
    Block size also plays a role in the scalability issue because miners want to validate
    bigger transactions in order to receive higher transactional fees. The scalability
    issue may be categorized into storage optimization and redesigning of blockchains.
    Solutions are invited from research community to address these challenges.

    susceptible block if a small amount of hashing power is used. In this method,
    miners do not broadcast the mined block’s result immediately. They open a private
    branch in which the mined blocks are posted after certain conditions are met.
    True miners waste their resources and a lot of time in mining the block whereas
    the private link is mined by selfish miners.

    Security can be detailed in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    This always remains an open challenge in public blockchain. Confidentiality is
    poor in distributed systems since it copies information to entire network. The
    integrity principle of CIA triad still faces many more challenges in real time;
    even integrity of information proves to be not altered. Read availability is high
    compared to write availability in blockchain.
