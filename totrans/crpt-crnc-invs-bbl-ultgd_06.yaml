    on the imperfections of Bitcoin. He realized that using Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency
    in general) for payment was only a small portion of its full potential..

- en: Realizing the advantage of Blockchain, which is not subject to change, he came
    up with a new concept – smart contracts. Bearing in mind that it is possible to
    store absolutely any information in such a network, Buterin decided to create
    his own blockchain called Ethereum.

    used for things other than just transactions.

- en: One of the main advantages of Ethereum’s blockchain is that each new block generates
    in the network within only 15 seconds, not 10 minutes as in the case of Bitcoin.
    However, in my opinion, another important advantage of Ethereum’s blockchain is
    that its creator is a real, live person. Vitalik Buterin is invested in the future
    of his platform, visits various cryptocurrency conferences, shares ideas, creates
    bank consortia, etc.

- en: A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms
    of a contract. It often happens that one of the signatories may interpret the
    contract terms the way he likes it. Meanwhile, smart contracts are computer protocols
    intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract
    in an unbiased manner.

- en: So let's think about where you can apply smart contracts. First, you can use
    them to buy or sell shares in the stock exchange and participate in crowdfunding.
    Nowadays, many companies have to pay more than $5 million for their shares to
    be traded on NYSE or NASDAQ. These costs are incommensurably smaller if using
    Blockchain, and they can theoretically be reduced even to zero.

    ballot stuffing, re-voting, and any errors in vote counting. Furthermore, the
    results can be seen immediately.

    will be fully transparent, and any person will be able to take part. No kickbacks
    or corruption will be possible.

    government of Sweden experimented with Blockchain to keep records of all land
    plots, as well as their purchase and sale, back in 2016.

    using Ethereum’s Blockchain.

    I can quickly explain that PoS Ethereum resembles Proof of Work in Bitcoin.

- en: The transition from PoW to PoS is a significant milestone in the development
    of the Ethereum network., and it is inadvisable from an economic point of view
    to stay in PoW as it leads to high inflation over time.

- en: Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has recently announced his intention to conduct
    a survey on Ethereum’s transition to partial Proof of work. The Ethereum’s mining
    rewards will be halved, but new opportunities to verify the transactions will
    appear. A node that verifies transactions will have large quantities of Ether
    (cryptocurrency). That is, a person must have a certain amount of Ether available
    to be able to process transactions. Such a person is supposed to verify transactions
    absolutely honestly as he/she is also a holder of Ether.

- en: As you might understand already, PoS is a sort of central bank which holds a
    large amount of currency. Therefore, Ethereum will partially turn from decentralization
    of Ether to an oligopoly. There will be large “holders" who have accumulated huge
    quantities of Ether and thus obtained the possibility to process transactions.
    This will be their way of making a profit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Full transition to PoS is expected in early 2018\. Since the power of the network
    will immediately fall and the reward for the block will drop, I predict that some
    members of cryptocurrency community will switch to another currency or even leave
    the market. I predict only the most powerful Ether miners will stay on the Ethereum’s
    Blockchain.
