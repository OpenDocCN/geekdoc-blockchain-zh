- en: In this chapter, an overview of two IoT applications, smart badge and smart
    mask, are used to protect employees working in a crowded environment. The smart
    mask protects the wearer from inhaling very small microbes that are transmitted
    through the airways (such as influenza virus or coronavirus), filters the air,
    controls the presence of CO2, and measures the body temperature. The smart badge
    measures the wearer temperature. It is equipped with an SOS panic alarm for indoor
    and outdoor workers. By pressing the SOS button, the device communicates with
    pre-recorded IDs so that the victim can talk and alert the emergency services.
    Thanks to the GPS functionality, it is possible to precisely locate the user via
    a Google Map link.

- en: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be spread from person to person
    by droplets produced when coughing or breathing during close contact with an infected
    person. Infection can also occur without direct contact, when these droplets land
    on objects and surfaces around the infected person and the other person touches
    these objects or surfaces and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth. That's why
    it's important to stay 1 to 2 metres (3-6 feet) away from the person who is sick.
    Because some people do not have symptoms when they are infected with the virus,
    a physical distance of one to two metres should be maintained, whether the other
    person appears to be sick or not (Chamola, Hassija, Gupta, & Guizani, 2020).

    may experience loss of taste or smell, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle aches,
    congestion, runny nose, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and various
    types of rash. Some people become infected but have no symptoms and do not feel
    sick. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
    care. About 1 in 6 people infected with COVID-19 become seriously ill and develop
    severe symptoms of COVID-19, which include difficulty or shortness of breath,
    confusion, loss of appetite, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, and require
    hospitalization. . Older people and those with underlying medical conditions such
    as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes are more susceptible to developing
    serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
    medical attention (Henderi, Maulana, Warnars, Setiyadi & Qurrohman, 2020; Haritha,
    Swaroop & Mounika, 2020).

    some of the following precautions. Keep at least 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet) of
    physical distance between you and others, whether or not they have symptoms. Wear
    a mask as part of the overall public health measures to prevent the spread of
    COVID-19 even if you are not symptomatic or infected. For this purpose, intelligent
    masks are designed, whose role is to measure the temperature of the human body,
    filter the breathing air and control the presence of CO2 (Li, et al. 2021; Baluprithviraj,
    Bharathi, Chendhuran & Lokeshwaran, 2021; Rahman, et al. 2020). In the industry,
    and in order to protect employers from the contamination of the corona virus,
    badges are designed to measure the temperature of the human body and control the
    employers around this badge. the intelligent mask and badge communicate remotely
    with objects located in the same environment through the Internet of Things network
