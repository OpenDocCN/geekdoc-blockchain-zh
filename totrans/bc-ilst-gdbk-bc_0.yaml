- en: The tech world of today changes so quickly, oftentimes at breakneck speed. Internet
    finance had its run for several years, and then Financial Technology (FinTech)
    took its place. After the rise of FinTech plateaued, Bitcoin emerged. Then when
    Bitcoin miners and speculators came together, Blockchain technology thrived, and
    so began a new community. Waves of new concepts—ones that had been previously
    unheard of—captivated us. And with this soaring innovation and progressive technology,
    a surge of unfound anticipation of what the future may hold consumed us—even if
    we didn’t fully understand the technology.

    industry barriers against outsiders. Yet, in doing so, these terms—filled with
    technical jargon and gobbledygook—only added to the confusion of those on the
    outside, further isolating them from the world. Over time, an unintended consequence
    occurred: they lost the ability to communicate with the layman. Still, the general
    public is eager to learn more about this growing community and technology, as
    they don’t want to fall too far behind in what they likely see as the inevitable
    future of tech and finance.'

    Bitcoin mining, the algorithmic logic of tech geeks and Blockchain prophets. In
    the face of all the changes in finance, art, science, technology, and society,
    we will closely follow these innovations. And even though this may ultimately
    lead to nowhere, the journey itself—one filled with great unknowns—is worth it
    alone. This is Blockchain.

- en: 'In the summer of 2016, I took part in a three-day conference of Blockchain
    held on Necker Island in the Caribbean. Richard Branson, the famous hippie and
    entrepreneur, invited a dozen figures in various fields from different countries
    to discuss the application of Blockchain in the arms of waves and sunny beaches.
    Yes, it was indeed time travel. More than thirty people who had never met one
    another, with the background of governments, courts, intelligent systems, art,
    aerospace, and environmental agencies, came together. We held dozens of discussions
    on various subjects, including the capture of fugitives, prevention of money laundering,
    protection of artistic property rights, validation of transaction authenticity,
    corruption prevention, social elections, earthquake relief, and endangered species
    protection. While vividly feeling the concrete achievements in these fields, we
    were also experiencing a commonly applied logic: all discussions were results
    of spontaneous organization and cross cooperation based on big data analysis,
    without any authoritative organization or enterprise organizing the system and
    process. According to the words of a young man on the site, we were creating a
    brand new trust agreement, with all the participants writing programs restricting
    our own behaviors. There was no condescending god, king, government, or big company
    making central control, the world was still running, and more important, the revolution
    was happening. This young man was Alex Tapscott. He and his father, Don Tapscott,
    the writer of many bet sellers such as Wikinomics, had just published their new
    book Blockchain Revolution, now popular in China. In January of 2017, when Don
    Tapscott and I were guests together at an activity, I invited him to give a speech
    at the Chinese Museum of Finance this summer.'

    experts or Bitcoin miners, and they knew nothing about hash algorithm and the
    issue of double spending. But we all discussed Blockchain confidently. The reason
    is simple: TV program producers do not need to know how TV signals are launched
    and displayed, and it is not necessary for mobile phone designers to understand
    technical principles of 4G (the 4-generation mobile communication technology)
    and functions of each component. Also, for consumers to make phone calls or watch
    TV, in-depth technical knowledge reserve is not essential. During the evening
    party on the last night of the conference, the host proposed an interesting game
    in which everyone gave a unique definition of Blockchain. Some friends from Africa
    and Germany even rapped to express their ideas. Several keywords used were “trust,”
    “certificate,” and “transfer of value.” The Blockchain can realize the transfer
    of value and is the second-generation Internet beyond information transfer. Certainly,
    those were the perceptions at that time. Today, we have significantly enriched
    our understanding of Blockchain. Everyone has the right to comprehend Blockchain.
    Specific standard definitions are not required.'

    It is estimated that another hundred will be published by the end of 2017\. Similar
    to the period when the Internet just entered China, the overflow of books on Blockchain
    is a significant initial signal of this tide. Various translation versions of
    “Internet” appeared at that time, such as ![images](../Images/inl1.jpg) or ![images](../Images/inl2.jpg)
    but they were finally replaced by ![images](../Images/inl3.jpg) Geeks have widely
    used the translation of Blockchain as ![images](../Images/inl4.jpg) but someday
    this translation might also be replaced by a better one. The Museum of Fintech
    initiated two rounds of discussions on its translation in 2016\. Some counterparts
    and I preferred the version of ![images](../Images/inl5.jpg) But I also agree
    with many friends engaging in financial supervision, who think under China’s current
    situation, ![images](../Images/inl6.jpg) or “credibility” in English, may be misused
    by illegal fund-raisers, so it will be better to let regulatory agencies evaluate
    the credibility.

    technology. Bitcoin caused widespread concerns in society, particularly under
    China’s utilitarian atmosphere, which sticks to making profits. It became widely
    used in finance and investment sectors and was also immediately under close supervision.
    Meanwhile, Blockchain technology emerged and formed a more extensive application
    space independently. Like Internet’s TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or IP
    (Internet Protocol), if you are not obsessed with decoding and coding, you will
    be aware that applying Blockchain technology enjoys broader and deeper applications
    than browsing the Internet or conducting e-commerce transactions. Many people
    consider Blockchain to be an enormous distributed ledger system. Everyone gets
    involved in keeping and checking accounts, and no one can tamper with the data.
    It makes sense, but the function of Blockchain is far more than certificate function
    for keeping accounts.

    affect-based trust with technical design to establish a network structure in which
    all participants can become nodes and be involved in authentication, right confirmation,
    transaction, review, and adjustment. Features like transparency, low cost, fast
    speed, and broad distribution make it impossible for authorities to modify, forge,
    and ban records. We can imagine that in today’s fields of business, art, law,
    technology, politics, and even society, such a network infrastructure of civilized
    society building on computing ability and technical structure is very different
    from its counterparts. Operating without human feelings, it gets rid of crazy
    dreams, bossy authorities, distorted monopolistic consortia, and blind conspiracies
    concerning populism. Therefore, commercial fraud and emotional deception will
    not apply.

    not only happens in such fields as Bitcoin and financial technology. This embodies
    the vast change in society and the revolutionary influence referred to by many.
    Although the anonymous person known as Satoshi Nakamoto is the cornerstone of
    this era, the accumulation of social big data, unprecedented breakthroughs in
    computing, a pluralist and complex social network, and especially the life attitude
    and spirit of free choice possessed by people born after the 1980s all contribute
    to the core foundation of the Blockchain society. It might be difficult for us
    to foresee the future pivot of the Blockchain society, but it does disrupt our
    existing lifestyle. Nowadays, the most important thing is not how we define Blockchain,
    but how to understand and enter the Blockchain society.

    involved both governments and commercial organizations, was formally established
    by 25 countries. Jamie Elizabeth Smith, the former spokesperson and special assistant
    of U.S. President Obama, issued the Davos Declaration. The first national team
    members include many influential figures, such as Senior Executive of the World
    Bank Mariana Dahan, former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, former Prime
    Minister of Haiti Laurent Lamont, and former Economy Minister of Ukraine Aivaras
    Abromavičius. As one of the founding members of GBBC, the China Blockchain Representative
    Team serves as the leader of the Training and Accreditation Committee of Blockchain,
    which is a critical chance for China to be involved in setting standards in this
    emerging field. According to the agreement, GBBC is going to compile textbooks
    concerning Blockchain in 2017 and open free training courses to popularize Blockchain
    applications, which are supported by all walks of life. After this news released
    on the WeChat, 170 people across the country signed up for this course in just
    three days. Lecturers included the former Deputy Chairman of the China Insurance
    Regulatory Commission Wei Yingning, the first President of the China Blockchain
    Applied Research Center Xu Mingxing, and the newly appointed President Deng Di.
    The first trainees will be certified with GBBC and the Museum of Internet Finance.
    At present, Shanghai, Zhuhai, and other areas have started the new training program.
    The popularization of the Blockchain concept and successful application of Blockchain
    require the active engagement of the new generation of entrepreneurs and the tolerance
    and care of supervisors. Invited by the compilers of this book to write this preface,
    I’d like to finish by noting that I cherish the valuable opportunity to impart
    cutting-edge technology to trainees. I hope we can work together to lay a solid
    foundation for the Blockchain society.
