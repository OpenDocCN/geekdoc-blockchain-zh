    hired to build a sawmill on the bank of the American River, near present-day Sacramento.
    One day he was checking out the channel below the mill when some bright, shiny
    flakes caught his eye.

    from all over the world. Driven mad by “gold fever,” people abandoned their families,
    cashed in their life savings, and risked everything.
