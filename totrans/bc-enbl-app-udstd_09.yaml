    health care sector is a $3 trillion industry, and about $1 trillion of it goes
    to waste annually. Care coordination is becoming more complex as chronic conditions
    in the aging population continue to rise. In many instances, the technology available
    to health care providers is not adequate enough to capture all aspects of the
    care being provided. The result is a rugged transfer of information between parties
    that ultimately reduces the quality of care being provided to patients. This is
    largely due to providers having legacy systems, lack of integration with non-vendor-specific
    technologies, paper-based medical records, and a lack of horizontal transfer between
    allied health care professions. Hospitals are investing a considerable amount
    of resources into processing medical claims and administrative records when most
    of this overhead can be eliminated by using a sophisticated technology infrastructure.
    In this chapter, we discuss the payer–provider–patient model in the context of
    the incentives and services each provides and how this model is likely to change
    in the near future. The core of this chapter is constructing a conceptual workflow
    showing how blockchain can integrate into tracking a patient from the first visit
    to a primary care physician to the final diagnosis and a treatment plan. Then,
    we will introduce the topic of hot-switching, and briefly describe two new implementations
    of hot-switching enabled on blockchain: Lightning network and pluggable consensus.
    Finally, we will end with talking about waste management in healthcare and the
    efforts by Capital One + Ark Invest to reduce the economic inefficiencies applying
    blockchain to business processes.'

    three major players in health care. Figure [9-1](#Fig1) shows these interactions
    visually, and in this section, we elaborate on the incentives and benefits for
    these three players. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the payers
    are largely insurance companies, the providers are hospital systems or private
    clinics, and patients are a randomized sample served by a given insurance company.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-1.A simplified overview of the payers–providers–patients modelNow we can start
    to consider the different scenarios involving the model shown in Figure [9-1](#Fig1).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first scenario is the simplest one, including the patient directly paying
    for procedures and visits to the hospital. This straightforward system involving
    just two players is still the norm for numerous health care systems in different
    countries. In the United States, the cost of providing health care has increased
    significantly, so a new player has emerged within the system.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second scenario is the current implementation across the United States.
    The patients are provided health coverage after buying a premium from an insurance
    company. This company then gets more negotiating power to set viable prices for
    procedures and then pay for them on behalf of the patients. The providers now
    send the claims for payment to the insurance companies, instead of the patients
    directly. In this manner, the insurance companies have evolved to become a centralized
    portal for patients to remove friction out of the system and receive personalized
    health care.

    of new providers that are specialized entities for administering care through
    telehealth, off-site monitoring, and remote physicians.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The simplest case is the patient directly paying for services to the hospital.
    More complicated medical procedures and lab tests, however, require some coverage
    that the patient purchases from an insurance company. Now the insurance company
    pays on behalf of the patient for any medical bills. The provider also sends claims
    for payments directly to the insurance company, instead of the patient. This model
    is foundational to understanding the immense complexity present in the health
    care system today, which involves hundreds of other players. For instance, the
    domain in which insurance companies and hospitals can operate with respect to
    patients is largely regulated by governmental agencies. These agencies are in
    turn influenced by economic forces and consumer demand.TipChris Kay, CIO of Humana,
    delivered the keynote address at Distributed:Health in 2016 discussing Humana’s
    efforts toward adopting blockchain to reduce processing costs in health care and
    providing personalized care more efficiently to their members. He spoke about
    a potential path of evolution for the second scenario mentioned earlier wherein
    the blockchain can power the flow of payments between providers and payers seamlessly
    and drive accountability toward outcomes, not just procedures. Shifting the locus
    of control to the patient allows them to receive better care and satisfaction,
    without any increase in friction or overhead costs using the blockchain.The idea
    behind claims processing on the blockchain is to use features such as decentralized
    consensus, trustless transactions, and network verification to design workflows
    that reduce overhead costs and time. We wanted to address the following question:
    Can we design the concept of a patient workflow based on the blockchain that documents
    the transition of a patient from her primary care physician, to lab-work, and
    finally to a specialist? Let’s take a look at a patient visit workflow involving
    the use of blockchain.'

    system based on access permissions being passed from one party to another using
    public/private keypairs. Our workflow begins with Jane visiting her primary care
    physician (PCP) for a checkup following gastric discomfort after eating certain
    foods. Her physician suspects a viral infection and orders further lab work to
    be performed. She is further referred to a specialist, who gives the final diagnosis,
    and works with her to develop a treatment plan. Every step of this workflow is
    recorded on the blockchain as Jane’s medical record, with appropriate permissions
    regarding access rights and ownership. Additionally, Jane’s records would also
    contain a history of every check-out and check-in, including edits and additions
    that were made to the medical record. Closely tracking how the ownership changes
    helps us transition between the different points of care provided to Jane, and
    she has instant access to her medical records as a clearer picture of her health
    begins to emerge.The main objective of this workflow is to demonstrate the concept
    of how blockchain handles permissions and transfer of ownership between multiple
    unrelated parties. The use of user signatures using cryptographic keys is leveraged
    in creating this rudimentary medical record system. We can understand the attributes
    and permissions within our workflow better using the terminology of version control
    systems. Just as Git or SVN have commit messages and code commits, every check-in
    of new data to the medical record will contain a commit message about what changes
    were made. The blockchain becomes a remote repository of sorts (like GitHub) to
    which Git can push new changes. There are also locking mechanisms to protect the
    data: Once a document from the medical record is checked out to a user (a doctor
    or a nurse), it will be locked and no other user can check in new changes to the
    same document until the original user checks in his or her edits, unlocking the
    document. Figures [9-2](#Fig2) through [9-4](#Fig4) guide us through this workflow.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-2.Initial patient visitThe workflow begins with Jane visiting her general physician
    for a regular checkup. The physician takes a history and records any symptoms
    that stand out from a review of her body systems. He adds this information to
    a very standard method of documenting patient history called a SOAP note . The
    note will be added to the blockchain with a unique ID called the hash . Along
    with the hash, the physician will add permission and user group roles for accessing
    the medical record. Initially, only the physician and the patient would have access,
    but this can be expanded easily. Finally, the note is signed using the physician’s
    key to denote the initial commit of Jane’s medical record to the blockchain. Once
    Jane’s records are pushed to the blockchain, she also has instant access to them.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-3.Jane’s physician ordered some lab tests to be performed so two days later,
    she visits a labThe tests have been entered into her medical record along with
    the permissions to let a nurse at the lab access the details. The physician can
    easily set the access permissions and add new upload privileges for the nurse
    on the medical record. This workflow begins before Jane’s arrival, when the nurse
    retrieves Jane’s record and begins preparing for the tests. When Jane arrives,
    they have a consult and the nurse informs her of the tests she will be going through.
    After the tests , a report is generated and appended to Jane’s records on the
    blockchain. We can see this on the right side where Jane’s general record now
    has a new add-on for the lab tests recently performed. All these results are instantly
    available to Jane as they are uploaded.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-4.Specialist integrationIn this step of the workflow, Jane decides to visit
    a specialist to better understand the lab results. Two days later, she shares
    her medical records with a specialist. At this point, the specialist has two choices:
    The specialist can examine her records and provide a diagnosis along with a treatment
    plan for her without even needing a visit. Alternatively, Jane can go in for a
    consult and work with the specialist to adopt the treatment plan. The first option
    might help reduce the cost of visits and services received for Jane, as ultimately
    the treatment plan and diagnosis will both be made available to her on the blockchain.
    This completes the workflow from her initial visit to the point that she received
    a diagnosis. Every step of this workflow from the original notes to the final
    treatment plan were recorded on the blockchain. However, in the case of a patient
    with a chronic disease, the records from this point would be transferred to a
    chronic care facility that can check up on Jane regularly and help her maintain
    good health.'

- en: 'Hot switching is a design principle enabled by the blockchain to create systems
    where components can be swapped out while the system is still running with minimal
    latency in operations. The purpose of hotswitching is to re-route the flow of
    information, and this concept is only made possible due to the decentralized nature
    of the blockchain, that is to say, there is no single point of failure. Why do
    we need a new concept such as hotswitching at all? Traditional schedulers perform
    this job fairly well. An operational blockchain-based medical records system will
    require both live and off-chain components that are synced to the blockchain.
    IT infrastructure in hospitals should be very stable with minimal downtime, but
    hotswitching can enable isolated system upgrades without disruptions, and gradually
    transition the legacy systems that are still active to be compatible with the
    blockchain.There are two early implementations of hotswitching available: The
    Lightining network ( [https://lightning.network/](https://lightning.network/)
    ), and pluggable consensus. So, what is this Lightning network? The alpha-version
    of Lightining offers a mechanism to send transactions over new micropayment channels
    (sub-channels). This transfer of value occurs off-blockchain thereby making transactions
    instantenous. These channels ultimately sync upstream with the blockchain and
    preserve data-integrity of the overall network. In a similar fashion, off-chain
    channels can replicate and temporarily store the intermittent requests for access
    and release medical records based on pre-approved access controls. After some
    defined period, the lightning channel can sync the intermediate changes with blockchain
    and become inactive. The second application of hotswitching is pluggable consensus,
    which refers to the idea that you can swap out your consensus algorithm based
    on the types of transactions being handled on the blockchain. For instance, private
    transactions carried out on a public/private partitioned blockchain may reuqire
    a different consensus mechanism than general purpose transactions. Therefore,
    multiple consensus algorithms are allowed on a blockchain. We will discuss the
    implementation of pluggable consensus in more detail in a later chapter.'

    as an audit log for hosptials using DeepMind’s health services to assist clinical
    diagnosis. The hospitals are transferring sensitive patient data over to DeepMind’s
    machine learning and AI services to make clinical predictions, and this project
    is an effort to ensure use of data is compliant with patient consent. We reached
    out to DeepMind, inquiring about their efforts, and with permission, we’re reproducing
    an overview of Verifiable Data Audit from Deep Mind’s blog post:Data can be a
    powerful force for social progress, helping our most important institutions to
    improve how they serve their communities. As cities, hospitals, and transport
    systems find new ways to understand what people need from them, they’re unearthing
    opportunities to change how they work today and identifying exciting ideas for
    the future.Data can only benefit society if it has society’s trust and confidence,
    and here we all face a challenge. Now that you can use data for so many more purposes,
    people aren’t just asking about who’s holding information and whether it’s being
    kept securely – they also want greater assurances about precisely what is being
    done with it.In that context, auditability becomes an increasingly important virtue.
    Any well-built digital tool will already log how it uses data, and be able to
    show and justify those logs if challenged. But the more powerful and secure we
    can make that audit process, the easier it becomes to establish real confidence
    about how data is being used in practice.Imagine a service that could give mathematical
    assurance about what is happening with each individual piece of personal data,
    without possibility of falsification or omission. Imagine the ability for the
    inner workings of that system to be checked in real-time, to ensure that data
    is only being used as it should be. Imagine that the infrastructure powering this
    was freely available as open source, so any organisation in the world could implement
    their own version if they wanted to.The working title for this project is “Verifiable
    Data Audit”, and we’re really excited to share more details about what we’re planning

    Audit for DeepMind Health, our effort to provide the health service with technology
    that can help clinicians predict, diagnose and prevent serious illnesses – a key
    part of DeepMind’s mission to deploy technology for social benefit.Given the sensitivity
    of health data, we’ve always believed that we should aim to be as innovative with
    governance as we are with the technology itself. We’ve already invited additional
    oversight of DeepMind Health by appointing a panel of unpaid Independent Reviewers
    who are charged with scrutinising our healthcare work, commissioning audits, and
    publishing an annual report with their findings.We see Verifiable Data Audit as
    a powerful complement to this scrutiny, giving our partner hospitals an additional
    real-time and fully proven mechanism to check how we’re processing data. We think
    this approach will be particularly useful in health, given the sensitivity of
    personal medical data and the need for each interaction with data to be appropriately
    authorised and consistent with rules around patient consent. For example, an organisation
    holding health data can’t simply decide to start carrying out research on patient
    records being used to provide care, or repurpose a research dataset for some other
    unapproved use. In other words: it’s not just where the data is stored, it’s what’s
    being done with it that counts. We want to make that verifiable and auditable,
    in real-time, for the first time.So, how will it work? We serve our hospital partners
    as a data processor, meaning that our role is to provide secure data services
    under their instructions, with the hospital remaining in full control throughout.
    Right now, any time our systems receive or touch that data, we create a log of
    that interaction that can be audited later if needed.With Verifiable Data Audit,
    we’ll build on this further. Each time there’s any interaction with data, we’ll
    begin to add an entry to a special digital ledger. That entry will record the
    fact that a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why -
    for example, that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm
    to detect possible acute kidney injury.The ledger and the entries within it will
    share some of the properties of blockchain, which is the idea behind Bitcoin and
    other projects. Like blockchain, the ledger will be append-only, so once a record
    of data use is added, it can’t later be erased. And like blockchain, the ledger
    will make it possible for third parties to verify that nobody has tampered with
    any of the entries.But it’ll also differ from blockchain in a few important ways.
    Blockchain is decentralised, and so the verification of any ledger is decided
    by consensus amongst a wide set of participants. To prevent abuse, most blockchains
    require participants to repeatedly carry out complex calculations, with huge associated
    costs (according to some estimates, the total energy usage of blockchain participants
    could be as much as the power consumption of Cyprus). This isn’t necessary when
    it comes to the health service, because we already have trusted institutions like
    hospitals or national bodies who can be relied on to verify the integrity of ledgers,
    avoiding some of the wastefulness of blockchain.We can also make this more efficient
    by replacing the chain part of blockchain, and using a tree-like structure instead
    (if you’d like to understand more about Merkle trees, a good place to start would
    be this blog from the UK’s Government Digital Service). The overall effect is
    much the same. Every time we add an entry to the ledger, we’ll generate a value
    known as a “cryptographic hash”. This hash process is special because it summarises
    not only the latest entry, but all of the previous values in the ledger too. This
    makes it effectively impossible for someone to go back and quietly alter one of
    the entries, since that will not only change the hash value of that entry but
    also that of the whole tree.In simple terms, you can think of it as a bit like
    the last move of a game of Jenga. You might try to gently take or move one of
    the pieces - but due to the overall structure, that’s going to end up making a
    big noise! So, now we have an improved version of the humble audit log: a fully
    trustworthy, efficient ledger that we know captures all interactions with data,
    and which can be validated by a reputable third party in the healthcare community.
    What do we do with that?The short answer is: massively improve the way in which
    these records can be audited. We’ll build a dedicated online interface that authorised
    staff at our partner hospitals can use to examine the audit trail of DeepMind
    Health’s data use in real-time. It will allow continuous verification that our
    systems are working as they should, and enable our partners to easily query the
    ledger to check for particular types of data use. We’d also like to enable our
    partners to run automated queries, effectively setting alarms that would be triggered
    if anything unusual took place. And, in time, we could even give our partners
    the option of allowing others to check our data processing, such as individual
    patients or patient groups.'

    the issue we think it’s worth it. Right now, three big technical challenges stand
    out.No blind spots. For this to be provably trustworthy, it can’t be possible
    for data use to take place without being logged in the ledger - otherwise, the
    concept falls apart. As well as designing the logs to record the time, nature
    and purpose of any interaction with data, we’d also like to be able to prove that
    there’s no other software secretly interacting with data in the background. As
    well as logging every single data interaction in our ledger, we will also need
    to use formal methods as well as code and data centre audits by experts, to prove
    that every data access by every piece of software in the data centre is captured
    by these logs. We’re also interested in efforts to guarantee the trustworthiness
    of the hardware on which these systems run - an active topic of computer science

    an interface to allow our partner hospitals to provably check in real-time that
    we’re only using patient data for approved purposes. If these partners wanted
    to extend that ability to others, like patients or patient groups, there would
    be complex design questions to resolve.A long list of log entries may not be useful
    to many patients, and some may prefer to read a consolidated view or rely on a
    trusted intermediary instead. Equally, a patient group may not have the authority
    to see identified data, which would mean allowing our partners to provide some
    form of system-wide information - for example, whether machine learning algorithms
    have been run on particular datasets - without unintentionally revealing patient
    data. For technical details on how we could provide verified access to subsets
    or summaries of the data, see the open source Trillian project, which we will
    be using, and this paper explaining how it works.Decentralised data and logs,
    without gaps. There’s no single patient identified information database in the
    UK, and so the process of care involves data travelling back and forth between
    healthcare providers, IT systems, and even patient-controlled services like wearable
    devices. There’s a lot of work going into making these systems interoperable (our
    mobile product, Streams, is built to interoperable standards) so they can work
    safely together. It would be helpful for these standards to include auditability
    as well, to avoid gaps where data becomes unauditable as it passes from one system
    to another.This doesn’t mean that a data processor like DeepMind should see data
    or audit logs from other systems. Logs should remain decentralised, just like
    the data itself. Audit interoperability would simply provide additional reassurance
    that this data can’t be tampered with as it travels between systems.This is a
    significant technical challenge, but we think it should be possible. Specifically,
    there’s an emerging open standard for interoperability in healthcare called FHIR,
    which could be extended to include auditability in useful ways.

    and are planning to blog about our progress and the challenges we encounter as
    we go. We recognise this is really hard, and the toughest challenges are by no
    means the technical ones. We hope that by sharing our process and documenting
    our pitfalls openly, we’ll be able to partner with and get feedback from as many
    people as possible, and increase the chances of this kind of infrastructure being
    used more widely one day, within healthcare and maybe even beyond.

- en: This chapter focused on the emerging role of blockchain in payments processing
    and how that can be applied to health care. We began the discussion with a description
    of the centralized payer–provider–patient model and how that model will change
    in the near future. Then, we discussed how to build a simplistic electronic health
    record system using the blockchain. After that, we presented how a patient workflow
    can be recorded on the blockchain. Finally, we talked about the economic wastes
    in health care discussed by Ark Invest and Gem and how the blockchain can alleviate
    some of those strains in the near future.
