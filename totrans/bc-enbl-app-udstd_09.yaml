    health care sector is a $3 trillion industry, and about $1 trillion of it goes
    to waste annually. Care coordination is becoming more complex as chronic conditions
    in the aging population continue to rise. In many instances, the technology available
    to health care providers is not adequate enough to capture all aspects of the
    care being provided. The result is a rugged transfer of information between parties
    that ultimately reduces the quality of care being provided to patients. This is
    largely due to providers having legacy systems, lack of integration with non-vendor-specific
    technologies, paper-based medical records, and a lack of horizontal transfer between
    allied health care professions. Hospitals are investing a considerable amount
    of resources into processing medical claims and administrative records when most
    of this overhead can be eliminated by using a sophisticated technology infrastructure.
    In this chapter, we discuss the payer–provider–patient model in the context of
    the incentives and services each provides and how this model is likely to change
    in the near future. The core of this chapter is constructing a conceptual workflow
    showing how blockchain can integrate into tracking a patient from the first visit
    to a primary care physician to the final diagnosis and a treatment plan. Then,
    we will introduce the topic of hot-switching, and briefly describe two new implementations
    of hot-switching enabled on blockchain: Lightning network and pluggable consensus.
    Finally, we will end with talking about waste management in healthcare and the
    efforts by Capital One + Ark Invest to reduce the economic inefficiencies applying
    blockchain to business processes.'

    these three players. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the payers

    for procedures and visits to the hospital. This straightforward system involving
    just two players is still the norm for numerous health care systems in different

- en: The second scenario is the current implementation across the United States.
    The patients are provided health coverage after buying a premium from an insurance
    company. This company then gets more negotiating power to set viable prices for
    procedures and then pay for them on behalf of the patients. The providers now
    send the claims for payment to the insurance companies, instead of the patients
    directly. In this manner, the insurance companies have evolved to become a centralized
    portal for patients to remove friction out of the system and receive personalized
    health care.

    More complicated medical procedures and lab tests, however, require some coverage
    that the patient purchases from an insurance company. Now the insurance company
    pays on behalf of the patient for any medical bills. The provider also sends claims
    for payments directly to the insurance company, instead of the patient. This model
    is foundational to understanding the immense complexity present in the health
    care system today, which involves hundreds of other players. For instance, the
    domain in which insurance companies and hospitals can operate with respect to
    patients is largely regulated by governmental agencies. These agencies are in
    turn influenced by economic forces and consumer demand.TipChris Kay, CIO of Humana,
    delivered the keynote address at Distributed:Health in 2016 discussing Humana’s
    efforts toward adopting blockchain to reduce processing costs in health care and
    providing personalized care more efficiently to their members. He spoke about
    a potential path of evolution for the second scenario mentioned earlier wherein
    the blockchain can power the flow of payments between providers and payers seamlessly
    and drive accountability toward outcomes, not just procedures. Shifting the locus
    of control to the patient allows them to receive better care and satisfaction,
    without any increase in friction or overhead costs using the blockchain.The idea
    behind claims processing on the blockchain is to use features such as decentralized
    consensus, trustless transactions, and network verification to design workflows
    that reduce overhead costs and time. We wanted to address the following question:
    Can we design the concept of a patient workflow based on the blockchain that documents
    the transition of a patient from her primary care physician, to lab-work, and
    finally to a specialist? Let’s take a look at a patient visit workflow involving
    the use of blockchain.'

  zh: 最简单的情况是患者直接向医院支付服务费用。然而，更复杂的医疗程序和实验室测试需要一些由患者向保险公司购买的覆盖范围。现在保险公司代表患者支付任何医疗费用。提供者还直接向保险公司发送付款索赔，而不是患者。这种模式是理解当今医疗体系中巨大复杂性的基础，其中涉及数百个其他参与者。例如，保险公司和医院在患者方面可以操作的领域主要受到政府机构的监管。这些机构又受经济力量和消费者需求的影响。2016年，Humana的首席信息官克里斯·凯在Distributed:Health上发表了主题演讲，讨论了Humana努力采用区块链降低医疗保健处理成本，并更有效地为其会员提供个性化护理的努力。他谈到了前文提到的第二种情况的可能发展路径，在这种情况下，区块链可以无缝地推动提供者和付款人之间的支付流动，并使责任归于结果，而不仅仅是程序。将控制重心转移到患者身上使他们能够获得更好的护理和满意度，而不会增加使用区块链的摩擦或开销。区块链上的索赔处理的理念是利用去中心化的共识、无信任交易和网络验证等特性设计工作流程，以减少开销和时间。我们想解决以下问题：我们是否可以设计基于区块链的患者工作流概念，记录患者从她的家庭医生到实验室工作，最后到专科医生的过渡？让我们看一下涉及使用区块链的患者访问工作流程。

  zh: 工作流程
- en: 'In this section, we want to design a rudimentary Electronic Health Record (EHR)
    system based on access permissions being passed from one party to another using
    public/private keypairs. Our workflow begins with Jane visiting her primary care
    physician (PCP) for a checkup following gastric discomfort after eating certain
    foods. Her physician suspects a viral infection and orders further lab work to
    be performed. She is further referred to a specialist, who gives the final diagnosis,
    and works with her to develop a treatment plan. Every step of this workflow is
    recorded on the blockchain as Jane’s medical record, with appropriate permissions
    regarding access rights and ownership. Additionally, Jane’s records would also
    contain a history of every check-out and check-in, including edits and additions
    that were made to the medical record. Closely tracking how the ownership changes
    helps us transition between the different points of care provided to Jane, and
    she has instant access to her medical records as a clearer picture of her health
    begins to emerge.The main objective of this workflow is to demonstrate the concept
    of how blockchain handles permissions and transfer of ownership between multiple
    unrelated parties. The use of user signatures using cryptographic keys is leveraged
    in creating this rudimentary medical record system. We can understand the attributes
    and permissions within our workflow better using the terminology of version control
    systems. Just as Git or SVN have commit messages and code commits, every check-in
    of new data to the medical record will contain a commit message about what changes
    were made. The blockchain becomes a remote repository of sorts (like GitHub) to
    which Git can push new changes. There are also locking mechanisms to protect the
    data: Once a document from the medical record is checked out to a user (a doctor
    or a nurse), it will be locked and no other user can check in new changes to the
    same document until the original user checks in his or her edits, unlocking the
    document. Figures [9-2](#Fig2) through [9-4](#Fig4) guide us through this workflow.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-2.Initial patient visitThe workflow begins with Jane visiting her general physician
    for a regular checkup. The physician takes a history and records any symptoms
    that stand out from a review of her body systems. He adds this information to
    a very standard method of documenting patient history called a SOAP note . The
    note will be added to the blockchain with a unique ID called the hash . Along
    with the hash, the physician will add permission and user group roles for accessing
    the medical record. Initially, only the physician and the patient would have access,
    but this can be expanded easily. Finally, the note is signed using the physician’s
    key to denote the initial commit of Jane’s medical record to the blockchain. Once
    Jane’s records are pushed to the blockchain, she also has instant access to them.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-3.Jane’s physician ordered some lab tests to be performed so two days later,
    she visits a labThe tests have been entered into her medical record along with
    the permissions to let a nurse at the lab access the details. The physician can
    easily set the access permissions and add new upload privileges for the nurse
    on the medical record. This workflow begins before Jane’s arrival, when the nurse
    retrieves Jane’s record and begins preparing for the tests. When Jane arrives,
    they have a consult and the nurse informs her of the tests she will be going through.
    After the tests , a report is generated and appended to Jane’s records on the
    blockchain. We can see this on the right side where Jane’s general record now
    has a new add-on for the lab tests recently performed. All these results are instantly
    available to Jane as they are uploaded.![A430562_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg)Figure
    9-4.Specialist integrationIn this step of the workflow, Jane decides to visit
    a specialist to better understand the lab results. Two days later, she shares
    her medical records with a specialist. At this point, the specialist has two choices:
    The specialist can examine her records and provide a diagnosis along with a treatment
    plan for her without even needing a visit. Alternatively, Jane can go in for a
    consult and work with the specialist to adopt the treatment plan. The first option
    might help reduce the cost of visits and services received for Jane, as ultimately
    the treatment plan and diagnosis will both be made available to her on the blockchain.
    This completes the workflow from her initial visit to the point that she received
    a diagnosis. Every step of this workflow from the original notes to the final
    treatment plan were recorded on the blockchain. However, in the case of a patient
    with a chronic disease, the records from this point would be transferred to a
    chronic care facility that can check up on Jane regularly and help her maintain
    good health.'

  zh: 在这一部分中，我们希望设计一个基于公钥/私钥对传递访问权限的基本电子健康记录（EHR）系统。我们的工作流程始于简（Jane）因食用某些食物后出现胃部不适而前往主治医生（PCP）进行检查。她的医生怀疑是病毒感染，并要求进行进一步的实验室检查。她进一步被转诊至专家，专家进行最终诊断，并与她合作制定治疗方案。这个工作流程的每一步都作为简的医疗记录记录在区块链上，具有适当的访问权限和所有权。此外，简的记录还包括每次签出和签入的历史记录，包括对医疗记录进行的编辑和添加。密切跟踪所有权的变化有助于我们在简接受的不同护理点之间进行过渡，并且随着她的健康状况开始呈现更清晰的图像，她能够立即访问自己的医疗记录。这个工作流程的主要目标是演示区块链如何处理权限和所有权在多个不相关方之间的转移的概念。使用加密密钥的用户签名在创建这个基本医疗记录系统时被利用。我们可以使用版本控制系统的术语更好地理解工作流程中的属性和权限。就像
    Git 或 SVN 有提交消息和代码提交一样，每次向医疗记录检入新数据都将包含有关进行了什么更改的提交消息。区块链成为一种远程存储库（类似于 GitHub），Git
    可以向其推送新的更改。还有锁定机制来保护数据：一旦将医疗记录中的文档签出给用户（医生或护士），该文档将被锁定，直到原始用户签入其编辑并解锁文档，其他用户将无法检入新的更改到同一文档。图[9-2](#Fig2)到图[9-4](#Fig4)指导我们通过这个工作流程。![A430562_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg)图9-2.初诊这个工作流程始于简去普通医生那里进行常规检查。医生进行了一次病史记录，并记录了从身体系统检查中突出的任何症状。他将这些信息添加到了一种称为
    SOAP 笔记的非常标准的病历记录方法中。这个笔记将带有一个称为哈希的唯一 ID 添加到区块链上。医生还将添加用于访问医疗记录的权限和用户组角色。最初，只有医生和患者有权访问，但这可以很容易地扩展。最后，医生使用自己的密钥对笔记进行签名，以表示简的医疗记录的初始提交。一旦简的记录被推送到区块链上，她也可以立即访问到它们。![A430562_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg)图9-3.实验室检查简的医生要求进行一些实验室检查，两天后，她前往实验室进行检查。这些检查已经输入到了她的医疗记录中，并设置了让实验室护士查看详细信息的权限。医生可以轻松地设置访问权限，并在医疗记录中为护士添加新的上传特权。这个工作流程在简到达之前就已经开始了，当护士检索简的记录并开始为检查做准备时。当简到达时，他们进行了咨询，护士告知她将要经历的检查。检查完毕后，一份报告将被添加到简的区块链记录中。我们可以在右侧看到，简的一般记录现在有了最近进行的实验室检查的新附加内容。所有这些结果都可以在上传时立即提供给简。![A430562_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_9_Fig4_HTML.jpg)图9-4.专家整合在这个工作流程的这一步中，简决定前往专家那里更好地理解实验室检查结果。两天后，她与专家分享了她的医疗记录。在这一点上，专家有两个选择：专家可以查看她的记录，并提供诊断以及治疗计划，而无需甚至进行一次访问。另外，简也可以前往咨询，与专家一起制定治疗方案。第一种选择可能有助于减少简接受的访问和服务的成本，因为最终诊断和治疗计划都将在区块链上提供给她。这完成了从她的初诊到她获得诊断的工作流程。这个工作流程的每一步，从最初的记录到最终的治疗计划都记录在了区块链上。然而，在患有慢性疾

  zh: 热切换
- en: 'Hot switching is a design principle enabled by the blockchain to create systems
    where components can be swapped out while the system is still running with minimal
    latency in operations. The purpose of hotswitching is to re-route the flow of
    information, and this concept is only made possible due to the decentralized nature
    of the blockchain, that is to say, there is no single point of failure. Why do
    we need a new concept such as hotswitching at all? Traditional schedulers perform
    this job fairly well. An operational blockchain-based medical records system will
    require both live and off-chain components that are synced to the blockchain.
    IT infrastructure in hospitals should be very stable with minimal downtime, but
    hotswitching can enable isolated system upgrades without disruptions, and gradually
    transition the legacy systems that are still active to be compatible with the
    blockchain.There are two early implementations of hotswitching available: The
    Lightining network ( [https://lightning.network/](https://lightning.network/)
    ), and pluggable consensus. So, what is this Lightning network? The alpha-version
    of Lightining offers a mechanism to send transactions over new micropayment channels
    (sub-channels). This transfer of value occurs off-blockchain thereby making transactions
    instantenous. These channels ultimately sync upstream with the blockchain and
    preserve data-integrity of the overall network. In a similar fashion, off-chain
    channels can replicate and temporarily store the intermittent requests for access
    and release medical records based on pre-approved access controls. After some
    defined period, the lightning channel can sync the intermediate changes with blockchain
    and become inactive. The second application of hotswitching is pluggable consensus,
    which refers to the idea that you can swap out your consensus algorithm based
    on the types of transactions being handled on the blockchain. For instance, private
    transactions carried out on a public/private partitioned blockchain may reuqire
    a different consensus mechanism than general purpose transactions. Therefore,
    multiple consensus algorithms are allowed on a blockchain. We will discuss the
    implementation of pluggable consensus in more detail in a later chapter.'

    as an audit log for hosptials using DeepMind’s health services to assist clinical
    diagnosis. The hospitals are transferring sensitive patient data over to DeepMind’s
    machine learning and AI services to make clinical predictions, and this project
    is an effort to ensure use of data is compliant with patient consent. We reached
    out to DeepMind, inquiring about their efforts, and with permission, we’re reproducing
    an overview of Verifiable Data Audit from Deep Mind’s blog post:Data can be a
    powerful force for social progress, helping our most important institutions to
    improve how they serve their communities. As cities, hospitals, and transport
    systems find new ways to understand what people need from them, they’re unearthing
    opportunities to change how they work today and identifying exciting ideas for
    the future.Data can only benefit society if it has society’s trust and confidence,
    and here we all face a challenge. Now that you can use data for so many more purposes,
    people aren’t just asking about who’s holding information and whether it’s being
    kept securely – they also want greater assurances about precisely what is being
    done with it.In that context, auditability becomes an increasingly important virtue.
    Any well-built digital tool will already log how it uses data, and be able to
    show and justify those logs if challenged. But the more powerful and secure we
    can make that audit process, the easier it becomes to establish real confidence
    about how data is being used in practice.Imagine a service that could give mathematical
    assurance about what is happening with each individual piece of personal data,
    without possibility of falsification or omission. Imagine the ability for the
    inner workings of that system to be checked in real-time, to ensure that data
    is only being used as it should be. Imagine that the infrastructure powering this
    was freely available as open source, so any organisation in the world could implement
    their own version if they wanted to.The working title for this project is “Verifiable
    Data Audit”, and we’re really excited to share more details about what we’re planning
    to build!

    DeepMind 博客文章中关于可验证数据审计的概述：数据可以是社会进步的有力力量，帮助我们最重要的机构改善它们为社区服务的方式。 随着城市、医院和交通系统找到了理解人们需求的新方法，他们正在发掘改变今天工作方式的机会，并找到未来的激动人心的想法。只有在社会拥有信任和信心的情况下，数据才能造福社会，我们在这方面都面临挑战。
    现在你可以将数据用于更多目的，人们不仅仅询问谁持有信息以及是否安全保存，他们还希望更加确信地知道数据被用于什么。 在这种情况下，可审计性成为一个越来越重要的优点。
    任何良好构建的数字工具都将记录它如何使用数据，并能够在受到质疑时展示和证明这些日志。 但是，我们使审计过程越来越强大和安全，就越容易建立对数据实际使用的真正信心。想象一下，一个服务可以对每个个人数据片段发生的事情给予数学保证，而且不可能伪造或遗漏。
    想象一下，能够实时检查该系统的内部运作情况，以确保数据仅用于应该用于的目的。 想象一下，支撑这一切的基础设施是作为开源的自由提供的，因此如果他们愿意，世界上的任何组织都可以实现自己的版本。

- en: 'Over the course of this year we’ll be starting to build out Verifiable Data
    Audit for DeepMind Health, our effort to provide the health service with technology
    that can help clinicians predict, diagnose and prevent serious illnesses – a key
    part of DeepMind’s mission to deploy technology for social benefit.Given the sensitivity
    of health data, we’ve always believed that we should aim to be as innovative with
    governance as we are with the technology itself. We’ve already invited additional
    oversight of DeepMind Health by appointing a panel of unpaid Independent Reviewers
    who are charged with scrutinising our healthcare work, commissioning audits, and
    publishing an annual report with their findings.We see Verifiable Data Audit as
    a powerful complement to this scrutiny, giving our partner hospitals an additional
    real-time and fully proven mechanism to check how we’re processing data. We think
    this approach will be particularly useful in health, given the sensitivity of
    personal medical data and the need for each interaction with data to be appropriately
    authorised and consistent with rules around patient consent. For example, an organisation
    holding health data can’t simply decide to start carrying out research on patient
    records being used to provide care, or repurpose a research dataset for some other
    unapproved use. In other words: it’s not just where the data is stored, it’s what’s
    being done with it that counts. We want to make that verifiable and auditable,
    in real-time, for the first time.So, how will it work? We serve our hospital partners
    as a data processor, meaning that our role is to provide secure data services
    under their instructions, with the hospital remaining in full control throughout.
    Right now, any time our systems receive or touch that data, we create a log of
    that interaction that can be audited later if needed.With Verifiable Data Audit,
    we’ll build on this further. Each time there’s any interaction with data, we’ll
    begin to add an entry to a special digital ledger. That entry will record the
    fact that a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why -
    for example, that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm
    to detect possible acute kidney injury.The ledger and the entries within it will
    share some of the properties of blockchain, which is the idea behind Bitcoin and
    other projects. Like blockchain, the ledger will be append-only, so once a record
    of data use is added, it can’t later be erased. And like blockchain, the ledger
    will make it possible for third parties to verify that nobody has tampered with
    any of the entries.But it’ll also differ from blockchain in a few important ways.
    Blockchain is decentralised, and so the verification of any ledger is decided
    by consensus amongst a wide set of participants. To prevent abuse, most blockchains
    require participants to repeatedly carry out complex calculations, with huge associated
    costs (according to some estimates, the total energy usage of blockchain participants
    could be as much as the power consumption of Cyprus). This isn’t necessary when
    it comes to the health service, because we already have trusted institutions like
    hospitals or national bodies who can be relied on to verify the integrity of ledgers,
    avoiding some of the wastefulness of blockchain.We can also make this more efficient
    by replacing the chain part of blockchain, and using a tree-like structure instead
    (if you’d like to understand more about Merkle trees, a good place to start would
    be this blog from the UK’s Government Digital Service). The overall effect is
    much the same. Every time we add an entry to the ledger, we’ll generate a value
    known as a “cryptographic hash”. This hash process is special because it summarises
    not only the latest entry, but all of the previous values in the ledger too. This
    makes it effectively impossible for someone to go back and quietly alter one of
    the entries, since that will not only change the hash value of that entry but
    also that of the whole tree.In simple terms, you can think of it as a bit like
    the last move of a game of Jenga. You might try to gently take or move one of
    the pieces - but due to the overall structure, that’s going to end up making a
    big noise! So, now we have an improved version of the humble audit log: a fully
    trustworthy, efficient ledger that we know captures all interactions with data,
    and which can be validated by a reputable third party in the healthcare community.
    What do we do with that?The short answer is: massively improve the way in which
    these records can be audited. We’ll build a dedicated online interface that authorised
    staff at our partner hospitals can use to examine the audit trail of DeepMind
    Health’s data use in real-time. It will allow continuous verification that our
    systems are working as they should, and enable our partners to easily query the
    ledger to check for particular types of data use. We’d also like to enable our
    partners to run automated queries, effectively setting alarms that would be triggered
    if anything unusual took place. And, in time, we could even give our partners
    the option of allowing others to check our data processing, such as individual
    patients or patient groups.'

  zh: 今年我们将开始为DeepMind Health构建可验证数据审计，这是我们提供健康服务技术的努力，可以帮助临床医生预测、诊断和预防严重疾病 - 这是DeepMind部署技术造福社会使命的重要组成部分。考虑到健康数据的敏感性，我们一直认为我们应该在治理方面与技术本身一样具有创新性。我们已经通过任命一组无偿的独立评审员来进一步加强对DeepMind
    Health的监督，他们负责审查我们的医疗保健工作，委托审计，并发布年度报告，报告其中的发现。我们认为，可验证数据审计是这种监督的一个强大补充，为我们的合作医院提供了一个额外的实时和完全验证的机制，以检查我们如何处理数据。我们认为这种方法在健康领域特别有用，因为个人医疗数据的敏感性以及对每次与数据的交互都必须得到适当授权并符合关于患者同意的规定。例如，持有健康数据的组织不能简单地决定开始对用于提供护理的患者记录进行研究，或者重新利用研究数据集进行其他未经批准的用途。换句话说：重要的不仅仅是数据存储的位置，还有对数据的处理。我们希望首次将这些可验证和可审计化，实时化。那么，它将如何运作呢？我们作为数据处理器为我们的医院合作伙伴提供服务，这意味着我们的角色是根据他们的指示提供安全的数据服务，而医院则始终完全控制着。目前，每当我们的系统接收或触及数据时，我们都会创建该交互的日志，以供以后审计需要。有了可验证数据审计，我们将进一步完善这一点。每次与数据进行任何交互时，我们将开始向特殊数字分类帐添加一个条目。该条目将记录已使用特定数据的事实，以及原因
    - 例如，血液检测数据已根据NHS国家算法进行检查，以检测可能的急性肾损伤。分类帐及其内部条目将共享一些区块链的特性，这是比特币和其他项目的理念。与区块链一样，分类帐将仅追加，因此一旦添加了数据使用记录，就不能以后擦除。并且与区块链一样，分类帐将使第三方能够验证没有人篡改任何条目。但它也将与区块链在一些重要方面有所不同。区块链是分散的，因此对任何分类帐的验证是由广泛参与者之间的共识决定的。为了防止滥用，大多数区块链要求参与者反复进行复杂的计算，伴随巨大的成本（根据一些估计，区块链参与者的总能源使用量可能与塞浦路斯的电力消耗相当）。当涉及到医疗服务时，这是不必要的，因为我们已经有了值得信赖的机构，如医院或国家机构，可以信赖他们来验证分类帐的完整性，避免了一些区块链的浪费。我们还可以通过取代区块链的链部分，使用树形结构来使此过程更加有效（如果您想了解有关默克尔树的更多信息，可以从英国政府数字服务的博客开始）。总体效果大致相同。每次我们向分类帐添加一个条目时，我们都会生成一个称为“加密哈希”的值。这个哈希过程很特殊，因为它不仅总结了最新条目，还包括了分类帐中的所有先前值。这使得某人回去悄悄地更

  zh: 面临的技术挑战
- en: Building this is going to be a major undertaking, but given the importance of
    the issue we think it’s worth it. Right now, three big technical challenges stand
    out.No blind spots. For this to be provably trustworthy, it can’t be possible
    for data use to take place without being logged in the ledger - otherwise, the
    concept falls apart. As well as designing the logs to record the time, nature
    and purpose of any interaction with data, we’d also like to be able to prove that
    there’s no other software secretly interacting with data in the background. As
    well as logging every single data interaction in our ledger, we will also need
    to use formal methods as well as code and data centre audits by experts, to prove
    that every data access by every piece of software in the data centre is captured
    by these logs. We’re also interested in efforts to guarantee the trustworthiness
    of the hardware on which these systems run - an active topic of computer science
    research!Different uses for different groups. The core implementation will be
    an interface to allow our partner hospitals to provably check in real-time that
    we’re only using patient data for approved purposes. If these partners wanted
    to extend that ability to others, like patients or patient groups, there would
    be complex design questions to resolve.A long list of log entries may not be useful
    to many patients, and some may prefer to read a consolidated view or rely on a
    trusted intermediary instead. Equally, a patient group may not have the authority
    to see identified data, which would mean allowing our partners to provide some
    form of system-wide information - for example, whether machine learning algorithms
    have been run on particular datasets - without unintentionally revealing patient
    data. For technical details on how we could provide verified access to subsets
    or summaries of the data, see the open source Trillian project, which we will
    be using, and this paper explaining how it works.Decentralised data and logs,
    without gaps. There’s no single patient identified information database in the
    UK, and so the process of care involves data travelling back and forth between
    healthcare providers, IT systems, and even patient-controlled services like wearable
    devices. There’s a lot of work going into making these systems interoperable (our
    mobile product, Streams, is built to interoperable standards) so they can work
    safely together. It would be helpful for these standards to include auditability
    as well, to avoid gaps where data becomes unauditable as it passes from one system
    to another.This doesn’t mean that a data processor like DeepMind should see data
    or audit logs from other systems. Logs should remain decentralised, just like
    the data itself. Audit interoperability would simply provide additional reassurance
    that this data can’t be tampered with as it travels between systems.This is a
    significant technical challenge, but we think it should be possible. Specifically,
    there’s an emerging open standard for interoperability in healthcare called FHIR,
    which could be extended to include auditability in useful ways.

    - 否则，这个概念就会崩溃。除了设计日志来记录与数据的任何交互的时间、性质和目的外，我们还希望能够证明没有其他软件在后台秘密地与数据交互。除了在我们的账本中记录每一次数据交互之外，我们还需要使用形式化方法以及专家对代码和数据中心进行审计，以证明数据中心中的每个软件的每次数据访问都被这些日志捕获。我们还对保证这些系统运行的硬件的可信性感兴趣
    - 这是计算机科学研究的一个活跃话题！不同的群体有不同的用途。核心实施将是一个接口，允许我们的合作医院实时地证明我们只将患者数据用于批准的目的。如果这些合作伙伴想要将这种能力扩展到其他人，比如患者或患者团体，那么就需要解决一些复杂的设计问题。一长串的日志条目对许多患者可能没有用处，有些人可能更喜欢阅读一个综合的视图或依靠一个可信赖的中介。同样，患者团体可能没有权力查看标识数据，这意味着允许我们的合作伙伴提供一些形式的系统范围信息
    - 例如，是否在特定数据集上运行了机器学习算法 - 而不是无意中泄露患者数据。关于我们如何能够为数据的子集或摘要提供经过验证的访问的技术细节，请参见我们将使用的开源Trillian项目以及解释其工作原理的本文。分散的数据和日志，没有间隙。英国没有单一的患者身份信息数据库，因此医疗过程涉及数据在医疗保健提供者、IT系统甚至患者控制的服务（如可穿戴设备）之间来回传输。目前正在进行大量工作，使这些系统具有互操作性（我们的移动产品Streams是按照互操作标准构建的），以便它们可以安全地协同工作。这些标准包括可审计性将是有帮助的，以避免数据在从一个系统传输到另一个系统时变得不可审计。这并不意味着像DeepMind这样的数据处理器应该看到来自其他系统的数据或审计日志。日志应该保持分散，就像数据本身一样。审计互操作性只是提供额外的保证，即当数据在系统之间传输时，它不会被篡改。这是一个重大的技术挑战，但我们认为这是可能的。具体来说，有一个新兴的医疗保健互操作性的开放标准，称为FHIR，可以在有用的方式上扩展以包含可审计性。 '
