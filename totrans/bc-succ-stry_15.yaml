    often tell us the same thing: by the time they’ve developed a curriculum to teach
    a class about blockchain, the technology has totally changed. We designed *Blockchain
    Success Stories* to be enduring examples that you can teach using the case study
    method.'

    Business School’s excellent website, “Teaching by the Case Method.”^([1](app01.html#ch01fn2))
    HBS case studies are the gold standard, and we worked hard to make the case studies
    in this book meet that level of rigor and quality, while adding our own special
    sauce.

    opening the session by asking a student to summarize the case in front of the
    class, while the instructor literally sits in a student’s seat. Blockchain technology
    evolves so quickly that no one has all the answers. Approach it as a lifelong
    learner.

    today, thinking deeply about larger principles from these stories that can be
    applied to other companies and blockchains. The chicken-or-egg problem from Helium
    ([Chapter 4](ch04.html#four_helium_a_blockchain_based_wireless)), for example,
    could be used to discuss any number of two-sided internet marketplaces.

    drive the discussion. There are no wrong answers; students should come up with
    ideas from analysis as well as their own experience. Encourage dialogue and debate
    among different points of view. Plan, but don’t overplan; adopt an attitude of
    “we’re in this together.”
