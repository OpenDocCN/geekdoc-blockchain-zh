    possibilities. From the initial crypto-currency to the current shrewd agreement,
    blockchain has been applied to numerous fields. In spite of the fact that there
    are a few investigations on the security and protection issues of blockchain,
    there comes up short on an eﬃcient assessment on the security of blockchain system.
    Blockchain, as a decentralized and distributed open record technology in distributed
    system, has gotten significant consideration recently. It applies a connected
    square structure to check and store information, and applies the believed agreement
    instrument to synchronize changes in information, which makes it conceivable to
    make a sealed advanced stage for putting and sharing information. It is accepted
    that blockchain can be applied to differing Internet intelligent frameworks (e.g.,
    Internet of Things, flexibly chain frameworks, human identity management and so
    on). In any case, there are some security challenges that may obstruct the wide
    utilization of blockchain. For all such in this chapter the broader aspects of
    privacy issues, decentralisation and regulatory challenges will be parleyed, whereas
    business models in association with blockchain will also be taken care off with
    a keen focus on security and privacy aspects of the blockchain.

    has indicated promising application prospects and pulled in heaps of considerations
    from the scholarly community and industry [4]. Being the first digital money,
    Bitcoin was appraised as the top performing cash in 2015 and the best performing
    product in 2016, also, has more than 300K aﬃrmed exchanges day by day in May,
    2017\. Simultaneously, the blockchain system has been applied to numerous fields,
    including medication, financial matters, Web of things, programming designing,
    etc. [4]. The presentation of Turing-complete programming dialects to empower
    clients to create brilliant agreements running on the blockchain marks the beginning
    of blockchain 2.0 time. With the decentralized accord component of blockchain,
    keen agreements permit commonly doubted clients to finish information trade or
    exchange without the need of any outsider confided in power [4]. Ethereum is presently
    (May of 2017) the most broadly utilized blockchain supporting keen agreements,
    where there are now 317,506 savvy contracts and in excess of 75,000 exchanges
    happened day by day [4].

    in the year 1991 to impart or emboss a time stamp on the digital documents but
    that didn’t work well and the experiment was the failure, due to which today’s
    psychedelic technology was garbaged [2]. In the year 2004 a computer scientist

    is a place to keep the record (transactional) which is decentralized as it can
    be created anywhere, whereas it is accessible anywhere, hence it is distributed,
    but what about the security aspect? as it can be accessed and created by anywhere
    and by anyone, which means there is a need to make the concept more feasible and

    algorithms and the functions of the blockchain (in general terms it can be treated
    as the fingerprint, long record consisting of some digits and letters). Each block
    hash is generated with the help of a cryptographic hash algorithm (SHA 256) [1].
    As a result, this helps to identify each and every block in a blockchain structure
    easily. The moment a block (of blockchain) is created, it automatically gets connected
    or attaches a hash, while any changes made in a block either in the ledger field
    or anywhere it straightened affects the change of a hash too which makes the technology
    precisely highly safe and secure. In simple terms, the hashes help to detect any
    changes in blocks of a blockchain.

    bock range from 1 till 46; block 45 points to block 46\. The very first block

    all the blocks with the help of strong computer processors (processors here means
    highly configured computers). However, there is a solution that eliminates this
    possibility called proof-of-work [1]. This allows a user to slow down the process
    of creation of new blocks. In the architecture of Bitcoin blockchain, it majorly
    takes around 10 min to determine or collects the necessary information of proof-of-work
    and adds a new block to the chain, but as it was discussed the block can only
    be added by the person which have the best computational system, here logical
    ability works rare rather than the system power, hence this work is done by miners—special
    nodes within the Bitcoin blockchain structure. The miners who win in the race
    get to keep the transaction fees from the block that they verified as a reward

    of the block and checks whether the information/data stated there in the block
    is correct. If everything is alright, the block is added to the local blockchain

    to [Figure 1.6](#figure6), it is a decentralized ledger that can store information
    quite securely and immutably, utilizing cryptographic encryption and hashing techniques.
    But it seems in reality, that the word ‘decentralized’ is somehow stuck only to
    the definition [5]. A number of Blockchains out there in the market make use of
    centralized mechanisms.

    to data being processed “not at the same place (distributed)?”

    or viewed into three perspectives—first is “Architectural”. This states the number
    of physical computers attached or is in the network? Second comes “Political”—How
    many entities control these computers? And the last “Logical”—that derives that
    does the data structure and interfaces of the computers or systems act like a
    single structure or a swarm [5]?

    need to work with the goal that they can make a full-confirmation innovation which
    can deal with a huge volume of information and simultaneously it likewise guarantees
