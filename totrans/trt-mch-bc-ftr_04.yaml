    with each other. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin breakthrough gave us the first working
    example of how to achieve this even when large amounts of money, business secrets,
    and other matters of value are at stake. But as the community of Bitcoin’s users
    and computer owners has grown and changed, and as newcomers have demanded new
    functions and more powerful applications, there’s been constant pressure to upgrade
    and change the protocol to facilitate those needs. The problem is that in a truly
    decentralized, open-source system where no one is in charge, it’s extremely difficult
    to get all those people with their far-flung disparate interests to agree on what
    changes to make.

    to verify the legitimacy of the transactions contained in the winning miner’s
    new block. If a miner is satisfied with the contents of that block they will commit
    to connecting their next block to it if they are lucky enough to be the winner.
    If they’re unsatisfied, they would attach their new block to an earlier block
    whose contents they trust, leaving the suspicious one as an “orphan.” This decision-making
    forms the basis for Bitcoin’s consensus logic, which is based on a convention
    known as the “longest chain.” The idea is that if no miner has amassed more than
    50 percent of total computing capacity, then mathematical probability will ensure
    that any attempt by a rogue minority to add a series of new ten-minute blocks
    to a previously rejected and orphaned one will soon fall behind the majority’s
    longer chain and will be abandoned. The caveat, of course, is that if bad actors
    do control more than 50 percent of the computing power they can produce the longest
    chain and so incorporate fraudulent transactions, which other miners will unwittingly
    treat as legitimate. Still, as we’ve explained, achieving that level of computing
    power is prohibitively expensive. It’s this combination of math and money that
    keeps Bitcoin secure.

    important test of Bitcoin’s immutability. Solid censorship resistance was, after
    all, a defining selling point for Bitcoin, the reason why some see the digital
    currency becoming a world reserve asset to replace the outdated, mutable, fiat-currency
    systems that still run the world. In fact, it could be argued that this failure
    to compromise and move forward, seen by outsiders as Bitcoin’s biggest flaw, might
    actually be its biggest feature. Like the simple, unchanging codebase of TCP/IP,
    the gridlocked politics of the Bitcoin protocol were imposing secure rigidity
    on the system and forcing innovation up the stack.

    world of established enterprises, both finance and non-finance companies are in
    many cases opting for permissioned blockchains. Under these arrangements, some
    authority, such as a consortium of banks, chooses which entities get to participate
    in the validation process. It is, in many respects, a step backward from Nakamoto’s
    achievement, since it makes the users of that permissioned system dependent, once
    again, on the say-so of some trusted third party. Some prefer to describe these
    private network arrangements as “blockchain-inspired” rather than as blockchains
    per se, and tend to use the generic term “distributed ledger technology” to describe
    them. But they do use many of the revolutionary features that Bitcoin introduced,
    and they can tackle the many issues of trust that the approved members of these
    permissioned systems would otherwise encounter in sharing information with each
    other. Most importantly, permissioned blockchains are more scalable than Bitcoin’s,
    at least for now, since their governance doesn’t depend upon the agreement of
    thousands of unidentified actors around the world; their members can simply agree
    to increase computing power whenever processing needs rise. But, as we’ll discuss
    in chapter six, these permissioned systems may be inherently more constrained
    in terms of the kind of innovation that can be harnessed within them.

    a project conceived by Russian-born Canadian whiz kid Vitalik Buterin. One of
    the first proverbial “big ideas” to come out of Bitcoin was that a blockchain
    network could be used to transfer more than just currency without an intermediary.
    Anything that could be digitized—a land title, a contract, medical records, copyrights,
    legal contracts, personal IDs, even the registration of a corporation—and transferred
    across a network could be inserted into a blockchain transaction and recorded
    in an immutable setting. And what that meant was that an entirely new, automated
    economy of peer-to-peer exchanges could be possible. The problem was that Bitcoin’s
    single-purpose currency design wasn’t ideally suited for these non-currency applications.
    So, Buterin took the core decentralized concepts and designed a new program optimized
    for “smart contracts” that would run specialized, decentralized applications,
    or Dapps, allowing users to exchange anything.

  zh: 有一个平台，可以说吸引了与比特币一样多的关注，那就是以太坊，这是由俄罗斯出生的加拿大天才维塔利克·布特林构思的项目。比特币最早的“大想法”之一是，区块链网络可以用于在没有中介的情况下转移不仅仅是货币的东西。任何可以数字化的东西——土地所有权、合同、医疗记录、版权、法律合同、个人身份证明，甚至公司注册——都可以被插入到区块链交易中并记录在一个不可变的环境中。这意味着一个全新的、自动化的点对点交易经济可能成为现实。问题在于，比特币的单一用途货币设计并不完全适用于这些非货币应用。因此，布特林采用了核心的去中心化概念，并设计了一个针对“智能合约”的新程序，该程序可以运行专门的、去中心化的应用程序，或者称为Dapps，允许用户交换任何东西。
- en: The idea is that computers on Ethereum’s network would compete for the right
    to carry out the Dapps’ encoded instructions to issue and transfer digital assets.
    The computers would earn Ethereum’s currency, ether, in return for that computing
    work. Because the network was decentralized, the Dapps could run in an entirely
    impartial fashion that users could trust to execute as the contract stipulates.
    If it lived up to all that Buterin and others imagined, the system would amount
    to a global, decentralized virtual machine, one that always implemented users’
    coding instructions without any control by any one computer.

    the other party the difference. With an Ethereum-based smart contract, those kinds
    of deals can be executed automatically without the intervention of lawyers, third-party
    certifiers, escrow agents, or the like, since both parties trust that the tamper-proof
    system will function as advertised. Smart contracts could, for example, immediately
    trigger a transfer of title to goods in return for a digital-currency payment

- en: After launching Ethereum at the North American Bitcoin Conference in January
    2014, Buterin told the authors he wanted to create an “Android for decentralized
    apps.” It would be an open platform, much like Google’s smartphone operating system,
    on which people could design any new application they wanted and run it, not on
    a single company-owned server but in a decentralized manner across Ethereum’s
    ownerless network of computers. At the time, Buterin was just nineteen years old;
    he had dropped out of a computer science program at the University of Waterloo
    when he realized that Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency worlds were taking off and
    weren’t going to wait for him. Now he was building a universally accessible, decentralized
    global supercomputer. It was an audacious, revolutionary idea. Now, with more
    than six hundred decentralized applications, or Dapps, running on Ethereum, he
    is looking vindicated. In just the first eleven months of 2017, the system’s internal
    currency, ether, rose from just over $8 to more than $400\. By then the entire
    market cap for ether stood at $39 billion, a quarter that of Bitcoin’s. The success
    has made the wunderkind Buterin an instant multi-millionaire and turned him into
    a cultlike figure for the holders of ether and related tokens who’ve become rich.

    real-world crises. They made hard decisions that hurt some but were ultimately
    taken in the interests of the greater good—determined, hopefully, through as democratic
    a process as possible. The organizers went to great lengths to explain and gain
    support for the hard fork. And, much like the Segwit2x and other Bitcoin reform
    proposals, it wouldn’t have come into effect if a majority of the Ethereum miners
    didn’t accept it. For all intents and purposes, the fix was democratic—arguably,
    much more so than non-participatory democratic models through which crisis policymaking
    is enacted by national governments. And since Ethereum is more of a community
    of software engineers than of cryptocurrency investors, it was less contentious
    than Bitcoin’s struggle over hard-fork proposals.

    powerless, either. A group decided to continue mining and trading the older, non-forked
    version of ether, with The DAO attacker’s coins still there in the transaction
    history. They called it Ethereum Classic, adopted the code ETC for its currency,
    and traded it alongside the forked Ethereum’s ETH ether. You now had two versions
    of Ethereum. This created much confusion and some interesting arbitrage opportunities—as
    well as some lessons for bitcoin traders when their own currency split two years
    later—but it can also be viewed as the actions of a dissenting group non-violently
    exercising their right to secede. More than a year later, Ethereum Classic is
    still around, though it trades at a small fraction of Ethereum’s value, which
    means The DAO attacker’s funds—whose movements on the public Ethereum blockchain
    have been closely watched—are of lower value than if they’d been preserved in
    ETH.

    among cryptographers but often overlooked by the general public: a lack of privacy.
    Despite the prevailing perception of Bitcoin as an anonymous instrument and its
    occasional, well-publicized use by criminals and hackers to hide their identities,
    the reality is that the Bitcoin blockchain is a very public ledger. And although
    you won’t see any names, only alphanumeric strings as addresses, having every
    transaction visible to everyone and traceable means that people—and the law—can
    eventually track you down, especially now that regulated bitcoin exchanges must
    comply with know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. This fuels nervousness among
    all who care deeply about the fundamental human right of privacy. Without true
    privacy, unhindered open economic access and social interaction will remain a

- en: 'You might ask, why shouldn’t we be able to catch those odious ransomware hackers
    when they cash out for dollars? Well, for one thing, the forever-recorded block
    history of a specific coin’s brushes with the law can undermine its value relative
    to another. As Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, founder of a new cryptocurrency called Zcash,
    explains, it’s all about ensuring a currency’s “fungibility”—the principle that
    “if you’re going to pay someone with something, and you have two of them, it doesn’t
    matter which one you give them.” In other words, every dollar, or yen, or pound
    is worth the same regardless of the serial number on the relevant banknote. This
    isn’t always the case with bitcoin. When the FBI auctioned the 144,000 bitcoins
    (worth $1.4 billion as of late November 2017) that it seized from Ross Ulbricht,
    the convicted mastermind of the Silk Road illicit goods marketplace, those coins
    fetched a significantly higher price than others in the market. The notion was
    that they had now been “whitewashed” by the U.S. government. In comparison, other
    bitcoins with a potentially shady past should be worth less because of the risk
    of future seizure. That’s hardly fair: imagine if the dollar notes in your wallet
    were hit with a 10 percent tax because the merchant knew that five years ago,
    unbeknownst to you, they had been handled by a drug dealer. To avoid these distortions
    and create a cryptocurrency that works more like fungible cash, Wilcox’s Zcash
    uses sophisticated “zero-knowledge proofs” to allow miners to prove that holders
    of the currency aren’t double-spending without being able to trace the addresses.'

  zh: 你可能会问，为什么我们不能在那些可恶的勒索软件黑客兑现美元时抓到他们呢？嗯，首先，特定币种的永久记录的区块历史可能会损害其相对于其他币种的价值。正如新加密货币Zcash的创始人Zooko
    Wilcox-O’Hearn所解释的那样，这一切都是为了确保货币的“可替代性”——即“如果你要用某种东西支付某人，并且你有两个，那么给他们哪一个都没关系。”换句话说，每个美元、日元或英镑的价值都是相同的，不管相关钞票上的序列号是什么。而比特币并非总是如此。当FBI拍卖了从Silk
    Road非法商品市场的罗斯·乌尔布里希特处没收的144,000比特币（截至2017年11月底价值14亿美元）时，这些硬币的价格显着高于市场上的其他硬币。这个想法是，它们现在已经被美国政府“洗白”了。相比之下，其他可能有可疑过去的比特币应该价值更低，因为未来可能被扣押的风险。这几乎是不公平的：想象一下，如果你钱包里的美元被征税了10%，因为商人知道五年前，你不知情地，它们曾被一个毒贩处理过。为了避免这些扭曲，并创建一个更像可替代现金的加密货币，Wilcox的Zcash使用复杂的“零知识证明”来允许矿工证明持有货币的人没有双重支出，而又无法追踪地址。

    this technology, for pretty straightforward reasons: they don’t want their or
    their clients’ trades revealed to the marketplace, since it would undermine their
    ability to do deals. In fact, there’s a surge of interest in privacy solutions
    for the financial sector beyond these new “privacy coins.” In February 2017, seven
    of the world’s biggest banks, including J.P. Morgan and UBS, joined forces with
