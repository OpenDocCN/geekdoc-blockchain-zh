    example of how to achieve this even when large amounts of money, business secrets,

    and computer owners has grown and changed, and as newcomers have demanded new
    functions and more powerful applications, there’s been constant pressure to upgrade
    and change the protocol to facilitate those needs. The problem is that in a truly

    user “signs” their public key with their private key, that action mathematically
    proves to outsiders that the user has control of the underlying information and
    can then assign, or send it, to another person’s public key. In Bitcoin’s case,
    that’s the process by which a person sends currency from their “address” (their

    multiple soft- and hard-fork coding change proposals, a group of businessmen led
    by longtime bitcoin investor Barry Silbert came up with the SegWit2x compromise.
    Backed by a who’s who of the Bitcoin business community (Blockstream was a notable
    exception), the two-step plan was to get a certain threshold of miners to commit
    by the end of July to first implement SegWit and then, in November, double the
    block size to 2MB. For the big-blockers it looked like nothing more than a face-saving
    exercise, since there was no way in an open-source setting that anyone could hold
    others to the block size doubling four months later. Nonetheless, the ploy worked.
    Shortly before the SegWit2x deadline it was revealed that more than 80 percent
    of the computing power was now signaling that they would implement SegWit after
    July 31, enough to declare it a done deal. And yet, even then, in the eleventh
    hour, Silbert’s team was denied a clear victory: a breakaway group in China that
    Bitmain was suspected of supporting said it would launch a hard fork after all.

    new currency bearing the symbol BCH (compared with bitcoin’s BTC) was launched

    with those characteristics, the fork was on. It was like a stock split—technically,
    all holders of bitcoin were entitled both to their original BTC and an equal share
    of BCH—except that, unlike a stock split, both sides were mutually incompatible.
    If that idea of equal-but-different money is confusing to you, you’re not alone.
    It was new to bitcoin exchanges, too. But once some agreed to start trading BCH,
    the market didn’t seem to know what to do with this new rebel bitcoin. The price
    initially jumped from an opening near $300 to $700, but then, amid signs that
    only one major mining outfit was backing it, it dropped back to just above $200
    and eventually steadied around $350 over the summer. Meanwhile, original bitcoin
    went on a tear, rallying by more than 50 percent to a new high above $4,400 over

    the code, to introduce a change to its monetary system, was seen by many as an
    important test of Bitcoin’s immutability. Solid censorship resistance was, after

    currency becoming a world reserve asset to replace the outdated, mutable, fiat-currency
    systems that still run the world. In fact, it could be argued that this failure
    to compromise and move forward, seen by outsiders as Bitcoin’s biggest flaw, might
    actually be its biggest feature. Like the simple, unchanging codebase of TCP/IP,

    in the validation process. It is, in many respects, a step backward from Nakamoto’s

    permissioned systems would otherwise encounter in sharing information with each
    other. Most importantly, permissioned blockchains are more scalable than Bitcoin’s,

    thousands of unidentified actors around the world; their members can simply agree

    a project conceived by Russian-born Canadian whiz kid Vitalik Buterin. One of
    the first proverbial “big ideas” to come out of Bitcoin was that a blockchain
    network could be used to transfer more than just currency without an intermediary.
    Anything that could be digitized—a land title, a contract, medical records, copyrights,
    legal contracts, personal IDs, even the registration of a corporation—and transferred
    across a network could be inserted into a blockchain transaction and recorded
    in an immutable setting. And what that meant was that an entirely new, automated
    economy of peer-to-peer exchanges could be possible. The problem was that Bitcoin’s
    single-purpose currency design wasn’t ideally suited for these non-currency applications.
    So, Buterin took the core decentralized concepts and designed a new program optimized
    for “smart contracts” that would run specialized, decentralized applications,
    or Dapps, allowing users to exchange anything.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea is that computers on Ethereum’s network would compete for the right
    to carry out the Dapps’ encoded instructions to issue and transfer digital assets.
    The computers would earn Ethereum’s currency, ether, in return for that computing
    work. Because the network was decentralized, the Dapps could run in an entirely
    impartial fashion that users could trust to execute as the contract stipulates.
    If it lived up to all that Buterin and others imagined, the system would amount
    to a global, decentralized virtual machine, one that always implemented users’
    coding instructions without any control by any one computer.

    grew to attract a wide tent of enthusiastic app developers. “You’re just as likely
    to find a web developer, a systems engineer, an academic, or an MBA. A transsexual,
    an avid Trump supporter, a Chinese entrepreneur, a New York City venture capitalist,
    or a techie in a hoodie who has 5 million dollars’ worth of ether. It’s a safe

    language, would enable smart contracts. As they were first raised in the pre-Bitcoin
    era by crypto-systems theorist Nick Szabo, smart contracts are a way to express,
    in a piece of computing code, instructions for executing transactions according
    to previously agreed contractual conditions. Lawyers often bristle at the use
    of the word “contract” in this context; contracts, after all, refer to legally
    binding agreements between humans. Machines can only execute the clauses outlined
    in those agreements. Still, the “smart contracts” misnomer shouldn’t distract
    from the idea that trustfully executed agreements could be extremely useful.

    a pre-agreed level—usually the initial purchase price—then one party must pay
    the other party the difference. With an Ethereum-based smart contract, those kinds
    of deals can be executed automatically without the intervention of lawyers, third-party
    certifiers, escrow agents, or the like, since both parties trust that the tamper-proof
    system will function as advertised. Smart contracts could, for example, immediately
    trigger a transfer of title to goods in return for a digital-currency payment
    when a chip with GPS capability detects that a shipment has been transferred to
    a designated warehouse. As such, these computerized contracts could revolutionize

    2014, Buterin told the authors he wanted to create an “Android for decentralized
    apps.” It would be an open platform, much like Google’s smartphone operating system,
    on which people could design any new application they wanted and run it, not on
    a single company-owned server but in a decentralized manner across Ethereum’s
    ownerless network of computers. At the time, Buterin was just nineteen years old;
    he had dropped out of a computer science program at the University of Waterloo
    when he realized that Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency worlds were taking off and
    weren’t going to wait for him. Now he was building a universally accessible, decentralized
    global supercomputer. It was an audacious, revolutionary idea. Now, with more
    than six hundred decentralized applications, or Dapps, running on Ethereum, he
    is looking vindicated. In just the first eleven months of 2017, the system’s internal
    currency, ether, rose from just over $8 to more than $400\. By then the entire
    market cap for ether stood at $39 billion, a quarter that of Bitcoin’s. The success
    has made the wunderkind Buterin an instant multi-millionaire and turned him into
    a cultlike figure for the holders of ether and related tokens who’ve become rich.

    Bitcoin emerged almost by stealth, with an unidentified creator slowly introducing
    it to a narrow subset of early volunteer users and developers until it slowly,
    but surely, caught on in the wider world. And whereas bitcoin tokens were started
    from day one at a zero balance, with anyone who knew about it eligible to participate,
    Ethereum started by “pre-mining” some 70 million tokens, which were sold and allocated
    to raise money for development, management, and marketing, and to reward the founders.
    In what was then one of the biggest crowd sales of its kind, Ethereum raised about
    $18.4 million in 2014 by “pre-selling” most of these tokens. Separately, another
    tranche of pre-mined ether tokens—16.5 percent of the total, worth about $3.5
    million at the time—was set aside for founders and developers. For members of
    the team allotted ether from that pool, it turned out to be a bonanza. Those same
    tokens were worth $4.7 billion as of late November 2017—a staggering increase

    many of the ICO token sales. For the time being, so many people are getting so
    rich with Ethereum that the top guys are mostly seen as heroes by other token
    holders. If anything, the biggest problem is the cult of success and the expectation
    that the developers can do no wrong. More so than Bitcoin, Ethereum’s lead developers
    function like senior managers. They don’t have the same execution authority as
    a regular company’s C-suite, mostly because the community of users can, as with

    explains, it’s all about ensuring a currency’s “fungibility”—the principle that
    “if you’re going to pay someone with something, and you have two of them, it doesn’t
    matter which one you give them.” In other words, every dollar, or yen, or pound
    is worth the same regardless of the serial number on the relevant banknote. This
    isn’t always the case with bitcoin. When the FBI auctioned the 144,000 bitcoins
    (worth $1.4 billion as of late November 2017) that it seized from Ross Ulbricht,
    the convicted mastermind of the Silk Road illicit goods marketplace, those coins
    fetched a significantly higher price than others in the market. The notion was
    that they had now been “whitewashed” by the U.S. government. In comparison, other
    bitcoins with a potentially shady past should be worth less because of the risk
    of future seizure. That’s hardly fair: imagine if the dollar notes in your wallet
    were hit with a 10 percent tax because the merchant knew that five years ago,
    unbeknownst to you, they had been handled by a drug dealer. To avoid these distortions
    and create a cryptocurrency that works more like fungible cash, Wilcox’s Zcash

- en: EOS is the brainchild of Daniel Larimer, an early pioneer in decentralized applications
    and distributed organizations. It also includes the well-respected cryptographer
    Ian Grigg—he of triple-entry bookkeeping. Block.one, the company behind EOS, lets
    miners verify records and confirm transactions by reviewing messaging data, a
    significantly lighter task than reviewing the historical balances that other permissionless
    blockchains require. With easier computation demands, EOS has been tested to handle
    50,000 transactions a second and should eventually be able to hit millions per
    second, EOS says.

- en: Tezos is structured to allow the community to more easily arrive at consensus
    over protocol changes. The system lets holders of the Tez token vote their stakes
    in support of special delegates empowered to approve staged protocol changes and
    incorporates flexible, dynamic rules that let users define and develop their own
    governance model over time. As we were going to print, Tezos’s viability was in
    question as an ugly internal spat, discussed in chapter four, undermined people’s
    confidence. Still, Tezos’s contribution to the development of more robust governance
    systems has been an important one.

- en: Every new idea will have shortcomings, yet, if developed by serious engineering
    teams, each idea can move the ball forward toward decentralization, functional
    governance, scalability, and privacy. This has been so with altcoins such as Litecoin,
    whose alternative approach to the proof-of-work algorithm showed that it was possible
    to stall the entrance of high-powered, industrial players into the mining network.
    Others—notably Vertcoin, discussed in chapter four—have improved on Litecoin’s
    model. Vertcoin has avoided Bitcoin’s unwelcome experience, in which the unrestrained
    competition for block rewards fostered a concentration of computation-heavy, electricity
    hungry mining operations.

- en: There are also various iterations of the so-called proof-of-stake algorithm,
    which sets a user’s right to validate transactions according to how many coins
    they hold. The core idea behind proof of stake is that with this “skin in the
    game,” validators are disincentivized to undermine a record-keeping system that’s
    vital to maintaining the value of their assets. One criticism of the model has
    been that without the electricity-consumption costs of proof of work, attackers
    in a proof-of-stake system would simply mine multiple blocks to boost their chances
    of inserting a fraudulent one into the ledger. But, more recently, a modified
    delegated proof-of-stake model has been developed—notably it is employed by EOS—with
    a more robust level of security. Called delegated proof-of-stake, it lets users
    appoint certain computer owners as delegates to vote on the performance and honesty
    of the miners—a kind of representative legislative branch to curtail the power
    of the executive.

- en: Our comparison to constitutional government isn’t coincidental. The protocol
    rules of a blockchain, as we’ve stressed, act as a form of governance over our
    economic behavior. Many businesses are betting that this technology will provide
    a new governance layer for the entire digital economy. That’s why figuring out
    how best to govern the platforms themselves is also critical. The good news is
    that with this open-source, ad hoc, global process of competing ideas and innovations,
    solutions are being discovered. Perhaps the established blockchains such as Bitcoin
    and Ethereum will learn from the upstarts’ improvements and absorb them into their
    models. Or perhaps they have too much at stake to change and will themselves be
    disrupted. Or perhaps some overarching cryptographic tool will come along that
    provides interoperability across all these disparate models, keeping them all
    alive but leaving no single player dominant.

    matters. Who decides what changes get made to these newly emerging economic systems
    does not just concern bitcoin mining companies in China or nerdy cryptographers
    in Palo Alto. It affects the future for all of us.
