- en: The concept of blockchain is prevalent globally in today's times. It has shown
    remarkable growth and has shown a lot of achievement by executing systems of peer-to-peer
    cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency was introduced in 2009 but created hype about
    digital currency around the world in 2017\. Blockchain works on the concept of
    a “distributed ledger/database.” The transactions are recorded and replicated
    to all the participating parties chronologically. Blockchain has verified to be
    immutable and provides accountability, integrity, and quite a lot of confidentiality
    through a pair of private and public keys. Various sectors have started using
    blockchain due to its salient features. Asset management is also one of the areas
    where blockchain can reduce transaction costs, approval waiting time, and increase
    transparency. The complicated processes of asset management can be automated by
    unifying permissioned and permissionless blockchain. This chapter discusses how
    asset management firms can use blockchain opportunities to harness its benefits.

- en: A blockchain can be defined as a “distributed ledger/database” to record the
    transactions in a chronological manner without the intervention of any central
    authority. The blockchain concept was first introduced around 2008 and used in
    a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin in 2009\. This Bitcoin created hype in the cryptocurrency
    market in 2017\. Bitcoin and blockchain are used as synonyms in the cryptocurrency
    literature, but the earlier one is an application, whereas the latter is a concept
    or framework. Conceptually a blockchain is a sequential chain of blocks, and these
    blocks are analogous to pages in a manual ledger. As a transaction take place,
    it is transmitted to the entire blockchain network in the form of the coded language
    known as cryptography.

    to authenticate a transaction. At the same time, a blockchain work on a peer to
    a peer network system, no centralized or trusted third party is required to authenticate
    a transaction. Any specific party/ node in the network act as a miner. Miners
    act as transaction validating agents in a blockchain network. The only requirement
    is miner has to solve a highly coded puzzle attached with a transaction to ensure
    no double-spending and other parameters of an authentic transaction. Once the
    miner validates a transaction, it is updated to all the network nodes.

    of the concept is continuously increasing in other areas such as Global payment,
    Insurance Claim processing, Internet of Battle-Field Things (IoBT) and Internet
    of Things (IoT). The glaring features of Blockchain technology, like its anatomy,
    immutability, decentralization and integrity, are making it a feasible choice
    for financial services applications. With the help of this technology, financial
    transactions can occur without any financial institutions like banks or any other
    intermediaries.

    examples of assets like commodities, bonds, debentures, stocks, real estate, and

    as it involves many mediators. Moreover, every party has to keep a record of theirs.
    Therefore, it takes time to settle any deal. Let us take an example of the conventional
    trading process of an asset. To find trustful investors, a car seller looks out
    for a physical or electronic platform to sell a car—the owner contract to a broker
    for seeking an appropriate buyer and give the owner a good deal. The second option
    may be that the owner chooses an electronic platform for the same. Since the broker
    of e-broker (electronic platform) acts as a linkage between the buyer and the
    seller, the broker has to do the due diligence of the seller-buyer and the asset,
    i.e., the car. It is also the duty of the broker or booking agency to take care
    of the sale deed and proper registration of the car in the name of the buyer and
    transfer the money to the seller's account after taking his commission from one/
    both parties.

    unique permissionless blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sell by the end-users through several smart contracts. This is technically known
    as double-spending. If the government office is satisfied with no double-spending,
    it should issue an authenticated smart contract. Then, the governmental office
    checks double-spending and encodes the law of the land in the smart contract.
    After all these checks and validation, the governmental office can deploy the
    smart contract, included in the registration request of the end-user on the permissionless
    blockchain.

    only after invoking a “Buy function” application/request. This function is attached
    to the mining nodes of the network. This application/request is executed along
    with the offer of currency units. The currency should be in the denomination that
    Manoj's wants to reimburse for the car. If the Buy function call succeeds, Anurag
    gets paid the amount, the tax is credited to the government account, and the car
    ownership is transferred to Manoj (Notheisen et al., 2017).

    between two parties. Intermediaries are overloaded with immense work in a centralized
    system. Moreover, there are chances of errors and fraud as things are centralized.
    Furthermore, the process is time- costly and consuming. The blockchain provides
    a feasible solution for such a complicated process by introducing the concept
    of distributed public ledger system, where miners work as a validator for “proof-of-work”
    (Morris, 2017). Each and every node in the blockchain is replicated with a copy
    which is a duplicate of the reorganized transaction. In this way, transparency
    and immutable of the process can be maintained.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are certain advantages and disadvantages of permissioned and permissionless
    blockchain networks. The permissionless blockchain network is ideal for cryptocurrency,
    whereas the permissioned blockchain can work only for trusted and well-known transactions.
    We have proposed an asset management system that pulls features from both permissioned
    and permissionless blockchains. Governmental offices have the potential to maintain
    trusted permissioned blockchains for safety and security purposes. Permissioned
    blockchains are used for the registration of end-user assets and to authenticate
    the assets transactions through smart contracts. Permissioned blockchains inhibit
    the users from double-spending of assets by taking care that every asset is registered
    only once. This registration is done in only one smart contract, which is authenticated
    and also only in a single permissionless blockchain. Finally, the permissioned
    blockchain ensures the legitimacy of assets trading. In this, the smart contract
    is used where land laws are encoded. Permissionless blockchains are used in the
    marketplaces where registered assets are used for trading. Identical or other
    permissionless blockchains can be used for trading registered assets in exchange
    for currency units. This extension of the transaction model has been made possible
    through single and cross-chain transactions.
