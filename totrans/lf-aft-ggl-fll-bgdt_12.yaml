    Gold, peering in all directions, I hankered for a hero for my still hollow tale.
    Forlornly noting no heroines in view on this virtually all-male frontier, I circled
    the cenotaph of what they call the “bitcoin space.” I contemplated the tattoos
    and ponytails, the suits and ties, the electronic cigs and medicinal smokes, the
    credentials and the Cringelys of the worldwide “blockchain community.” They were
    mostly a peer-to-peer display. Marc Andreessen or Gavin Andresen, Naval Ravikant
    or Chamath Palihapitiya, Jed McCaleb or Nick Szabo could move a scene or animate
    a meeting or keynote a CoinSummit. But from venture capitalists to complementary
    coders to bit players or even legendary titans, none seemed to have the proof-of-work
    to hash into the Genesis Block of a heroic bitcoin chain.

    the Genesis man himself. Why not? Satoshi Nakamoto was the architect of bitcoin,
    inventor of the blockchain, and the prime mover of the plot. True, he did not
    mention the blockchain in his paper, though he specified it, and true, no one
    seemed to know who he was or where he had gone. No one could depict his fleshly
    contours or countenance. He was the John Galt of this saga, the source and symbol
    of the new Galt’s Gulch of bitcoin. I decided to mount my steed and ride up the
    arroyo to the ultimate crypts and redoubts, mines and mints of the bitcoin and
    blockchain ideas and their derivatives.

    possible Satoshis by one man. “I am not Dorian Nakamoto,” he declared, almost

    People talked of bitcoin as an important facilitator for WikiLeaks. It would have

    and peer-to-peer,” concluded Satoshi. Bitcoin relied, so I surmised, on the absence
    of billionaire embodiments and hierarchical handles. If anyone is in control of
    bitcoin, its distributed security model fails. Satoshi would become just another
    dreaded “Trusted Third Party,” subject to subpoena by repressive governments or
    hacked by determined nerds or pirates.

    controlled networks like Napster, but pure peer-to-peer networks like Gnutella
    [music] and Tor [The Onion Router for encrypted email and video] seem to be holding
    their own.” Indeed, earlier in the century, the Tor system, originated in the
    NSA and developed by the entrepreneur Bram Cohen, comprised close to half of all
    Internet bits. Tor takes a video file, for example, and splits it up, peer to
    peer, across as many as seven thousand computers on the Net. Encrypting all the
    addresses and decrypting them one at a time as the file is relayed across the
    network, Tor ensures that no one knows the source or path of the file. Each file’s
    set of addresses is an onion that sheds its layers only as needed in passing to
    its destination. Satoshi’s bitcoin system could be said to reverse Cohen’s approach.
    Rather than concealing the information in transactions, bitcoin compiles it in
    blocks, timestamps it, and publishes it across all the nodes of the entire network.
    It is security not by concealment but by publicity. Both bitcoin and Tor are global
    data structures collectively maintained by untrusting participants. Without a
    central point of failure, Tor has been remarkably robust and successful.'

    of the way. The Internet as a global copying machine cannot create money or other
    purely digital assets. Any transactions have to use institutions outside the Net,
    whether banks, credit card companies, or PayPal. Any digital item generated on
    the Net alone can be reproduced in unlimited quantities. In bitcoin, Satoshi made
    possible a digital asset that cannot be copied without lots of work, which he
    called “proof of work.” The proof of work is provided by miners laboriously checking
    out all the transactions and compiling them into blocks. Thus Satoshi enabled
    the creation of money on the Net and used the money to pay “miners” to validate
    its transactions. Recorded in a public distributed ledger, the transactions are
    mathematically “hashed” into chains of blocks that form an immutable database
    published across the Internet. Unchangeable records of transactions constitute
    a form of money. But governments do not like private money creation. So Satoshi
    carefully preserved his anonymity.
