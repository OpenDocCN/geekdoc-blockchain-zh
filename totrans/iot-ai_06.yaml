    hence becomes the reason for the revolution in the healthcare industry. Government,
    Private, and Public stakeholders are now progressed toward data transparency by
    collecting data from different sources, preprocessing the data, and storing in
    an isolated repository that is searchable and actionable. Wearable devices, medical
    apps, wireless monitoring devices, tablets, and Smartphone have made the healthcare
    service omnipresent. It is expected that the adoption of connected medical devices
    will grow drastically in the coming years (Zhang et al., [2014](#CR49)). This
    increasing number of connected devices with the support of software and programming
    languages is making the healthcare industry a productive platform for pervasive

    a hospital-based healthcare system  (Porter & Heppelmann, [2014](#CR37)), but

    improved the healthcare services by providing remote monitoring. For instance,
    if a patient is suffering from diabetics, then the glucose monitoring system may
    remind the patient to take the medicine on time. For elderly and pediatric patients,
    it sends the alert to their caretaker. In IoT with smart sensors, the users or
    the caretakers can get the patient details, their diet, health issues, and lifestyle-related
    details remotely. In some cases, gathering the clinical data is not sufficient
    and to get the real picture of the health details, the data have to be analyzed
    regularly (Wang et al., [2018](#CR43)). With this advanced option, the physician
    can monitor the patient continuously without any physical appearance. The significant
    role of pervasive healthcare application has considerably enhanced the health-related
    data liquidity, which in turn increased the healthcare sector as never before.

    for a particular problem (e.g., Heart surgery) over a particular period is estimated
    by the provider and the payment is made for an episode of treatment. It is the

    and mechanical sensing characteristics. These sensors are implanted to observe
    the movement of the ankle, finger, pulse signal, and throat infection (Ling et
    al., [2020](#CR28); Gong et al., [2015](#CR17); Jason et al., [2015](#CR25)).
    Detection of minor strains and skin twists could be done in addition to the monitoring
    of minor movements. Apart from this, it is also used to perceive human motions
    like lumbar-pelvic movements. However, it is not possible to estimate the minor
    movements of the human body. (Gong et al., [2015](#CR17); Jason et al., [2016](#CR26),
    Ho et al., [2017](#CR18)). To discover and examine body movements like the pressure
    of the foot and finger movement, a nanomaterial-based electronic-skin (E-Skin)
    wearable sensor is utilized. With this sensor deployed in the body, the Lumbar-Pelvic
    Movement (LPM) is monitored. This aids medical experts to comprehend persons’
    low back pain experience (Zhang et al., [2020](#CR50)).'

    as the calories burned, distance traveled, and the exhaustive level of the moment.
    If a person walks energetically, then it will identify that the person is walking
    in an ‘active manner’. Counting of steps is done in terms of minutes. It also
    determines whether a person is running or walking.

    healthcare industry. The recent advancements in technology are supporting the
    development in the pervasive healthcare systems. Considering this chapter, various
    biosensors and their applications are discussed. Medical devices are connected
    to give better diagnosis and prediction of diseases, improved patients experience,
    timely responses, etc. The Internet of Things plays a vital role and is an assistant
    in the healthcare industry. The medical data are collected using sensors, and
    the patterns are observed to predict the diseases. Experts and healthcare specialists
    have developed many IoT-based applications with minimal cost using wearable and
    other remote devices. The objective of the e-health monitoring system is to provide
    the needed person guidance or prescription based on their health condition. Without
    any physical interaction, doctors can interact with the patients. From a clinical
    point of view, the progress in the pervasive healthcare system accommodates many
    advanced techniques that are providing integrated care and fills the gap between
    health and the management of diseases. This chapter aims to explore the use of
    Health and wearable sensors for pervasive and personalized healthcare. This chapter
    also addresses the role of IoT in the healthcare industry. The ultimate goal of
    this chapter is to explain the goal of personalized pervasive healthcare sensors
    and devices, its application in medical diagnosis and the follow-up treatment
    to improve the life quality. Considering the challenges, the integration of data
    from heterogeneous sources plays a vital role. In the future, stream learning
    models, high-performance computing, and semantic web will play a crucial role.
