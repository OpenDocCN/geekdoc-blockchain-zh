    hence becomes the reason for the revolution in the healthcare industry. Government,
    Private, and Public stakeholders are now progressed toward data transparency by
    collecting data from different sources, preprocessing the data, and storing in
    an isolated repository that is searchable and actionable. Wearable devices, medical
    apps, wireless monitoring devices, tablets, and Smartphone have made the healthcare
    service omnipresent. It is expected that the adoption of connected medical devices
    will grow drastically in the coming years (Zhang et al., [2014](#CR49)). This
    increasing number of connected devices with the support of software and programming
    languages is making the healthcare industry a productive platform for pervasive
    healthcare.

    of life by guaranteeing the overall health monitoring system that paves the way
    for the notion of pervasive health status of the health by providing medical facilities
    irrespective of the locality of the user. Traditionally, people are following
    a hospital-based healthcare system  (Porter & Heppelmann, [2014](#CR37)), but

    (Atzori et al., [2010](#CR3)), and Smart sensors (Dey et al., [2017](#CR13)) have
    improved the healthcare services by providing remote monitoring. For instance,
    if a patient is suffering from diabetics, then the glucose monitoring system may
    remind the patient to take the medicine on time. For elderly and pediatric patients,
    it sends the alert to their caretaker. In IoT with smart sensors, the users or
    the caretakers can get the patient details, their diet, health issues, and lifestyle-related
    details remotely. In some cases, gathering the clinical data is not sufficient
    and to get the real picture of the health details, the data have to be analyzed
    regularly (Wang et al., [2018](#CR43)). With this advanced option, the physician
    can monitor the patient continuously without any physical appearance. The significant
    role of pervasive healthcare application has considerably enhanced the health-related
    data liquidity, which in turn increased the healthcare sector as never before.

    devices with databases are facilitating the users to access the data ubiquitously

    the goal of personalized pervasive healthcare sensors and devices, its application
    in medical diagnosis, and the follow-up treatment to improve the life quality.

    emphasizes the challenges faced in the conventional healthcare procedure. Section
    [6.4](#Sec4) highlights the concepts of connected healthcare in comparison with

    Pervasive features such as adaptability, mobility, and context awareness give
    the correct data to the concerned person at the correct time. Pervasive healthcare
    transforms the healthcare system from illness to be well and to be healthy. Furthermore,
    pervasive applications such as mobility, wireless links, and handheld devices
    allow the medical record to reach the doctor before the patient is being admitted
    to the hospital. That is, when the patient is on the way to the hospital, their
    confidential health-related details like blood glucose level, blood pressure,
    allergies, and insurance details can be sent before the arrival of the patient
    to the doctors who can preassess any precautionary measures before starting the
    treatment. Moreover, the doctors can go through the patient records either officially
    or from home.

    by the provider and the payment is made for an episode of treatment. It is the

    leveraged by artificial intelligence and IoT for incapacitated and aged persons
    to address their healthcare issues is known as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL).
    Moreover, it assists the elderly persons to lead their life independently that
    too more conveniently and safely. The predominant solutions of AAL make elderly
    persons life confident in the case of any serious issues. The architecture is
    proposed to have proper communication, security, and automation with the help
    of IoT systems (Shahamabadi et al., [2013](#CR40)). The framework is particularly
    introduced to provide healthcare services to elderly individuals. Various technologies
    such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), 6LoWPAN, and Near-Field Communication
    (NFC) are exploited for active and passive communications. The framework that
    is designed can also be extended by incorporating different algorithms focusing
    on the medical requirement to diagnose the problems faced by elderly individuals.

    and IoT is presented in Zhang and Zhang ([2011](#CR48)). It addresses some limitations
    such as data storage, feasibility in the installation of the gateway, security,
    interoperability, and streaming Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, AAL-based

    medication (ICH Expert Working Group, [1996](#CR19)). This kind of injury may
    occur by taking a single dose of one drug or the combination of more drugs. In
    particular, it is inherently generic means that it is not specific for any particular
    disease. Hence, there is a common requirement for the design, which can handle
    common technical problems and provide solutions (ADR services). An IoT-based ADR
    system is proposed (Jara et al., [2010](#CR24)); in this, the patient’s node can
    detect the drug-using NFC or barcode enabled devices. The system can be coordinated
    with the pharmaceutical intelligent system to recognize the drug is compatible
    with the historical record stored in a repository  (Electronic Health Record).
    The iMedPack is designed using RFID and Controlled Delamination Material (CDM)
    to address ADR services (Yang et al., [2014](#CR46)).

    system is proposed (Rohokale et al., [2011](#CR38)), and a distinct authorization
    and authentication mechanisms are required to be incorporated in this cooperative
    network. A community healthcare monitoring network (You et al., [2011](#CR47))
    is proposed, which integrates several Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) to provide
    healthcare services. The topological structure of a community network is perceived
    as a “virtual hospital,” which enables access to remote medical services.

    staff can refer to the clinical guidelines using remote intelligent resources

    in monitoring patients remotely in a smart healthcare system, and it minimizes
    the treatment costs and geographical barriers as well. In the smart healthcare

    personalized user based on their physical condition. The system significantly
    influences the patient indirectly via persuasion techniques; the main objective
    is to change the attitude of the user to improve their health status. It also
    promotes predictive maintenance. For instance, a sensor can identify the patient
    is about to experience the heart attack by sensing the patient’s ECG signal. The
    smart healthcare paradigm transforms the way of approach, how the patient can
    connect and communicate, identify and access the new healthcare options, and share
    health-related information. It alerts people to stay away from various chronic
    diseases rather than undergoing treatment. Persistent monitoring and ubiquitous
    sensing are the significant features that are essential for critical and safety
    applications such as public safety, healthcare, and assisted living. It is programmed
