    be bought and sold freely, and perhaps later even sold on digital exchanges at
    a profit. Miners, of course, were hoping that the price of HNT would slowly rise.

    tokens to miners for helping build and maintain the network. On the other side,
    Helium provided services and support for companies that wanted to use that network
    (similar to Red Hat software, which offers services and support for the open source
    Linux). In this two-sided business model, Helium empowered the people to create
    a network that companies paid to use. Helium didn’t own that network; the people
    who own the Hotspots do. The company was, in a sense, creating a network only
    to give it away.

    enthusiasts. It was a prime location for innovators, startups, and investors.
    And Austin had local companies that were interested in piloting Helium (Lime,
    the scooter rental company, was already lined up).

    for the city. Within a month, the company had exceeded that goal, with 200 Hotspots
    installed in Greater Austin—enough coverage for the entire city. By offering a
    user-friendly product with blockchain-based rewards, Helium doubled its minimum
    goal, convincing users to install enough $500 Hotspots to provide wireless coverage
    for the city of Austin.
