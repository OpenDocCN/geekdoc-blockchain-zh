  zh: 摘要
- en: Although quantum cloud computing (CC) is based on theoretical notions, it still
    requires experimentation. CC has emerged as an on-demand accessible tool in different
    practical applications such as digital industry, academics, manufacturing, health
    sector, and others. Backup, security, processing, and localization are all issues
    that the cloud is dealing with. As a result, quantum computing has seen tremendous
    growth in several domains. In literature, the majority of those researchers working
    on quantum believe it will solve the cloud service issues. Quantum cloud computing
    (QCC) entails the deployment of quantum computation sources in a cloud environment
    to overcome the following challenges and concerns that the existing model of simple
    cloud computation faces. However, not everyone is interested in combining physics-based
    atomic computing with software-based CC. This study will demonstrate all of the
    probable benefits and drawbacks of quantum computing (QC) when used in conjunction
    with a cloud system. The same also cover some of the most recent updates, as well
    as some uncertain prospects for quantum as a cloud service. This work demonstrates
    the current state of the artwork in the quantum services domain. Further, a comparative
    analysis with similar areas is conducted.

  zh: 1 Introduction
- en: The concept of cloud computing was first introduced by Google's CEO at the search
    engine conference (Sessane Jose 2006) in August 2006\. The word “Cloud” refers
    to a cloud service in cloud computing. Because of tremendous advances in computing
    and information technology over the last three decades, the computer world may
    now envision a transition to the cloud computing era [[1](#CR1)]. In recent years,
    there has been a remarkable increase in Cloud Computing (CC) is found in every
    aspect of academic practices, industrial activities, and governmental operations.
    CC has accelerated advancements in security technologies and the use of internet
    services has increased significantly. In the case of the banking industry CC is
    an effective tool for transferring confidential data across the banking network
    [[2](#CR2)]. Such data transmission undergoes serious cloud security issues in
    respect of data protection and maintaining its integrity, quality of services,
    mobility, interoperability, and portability. In this domain, quantum cloud computing
    (QCC) theory focuses on the principles for developing the notion of computer-based
    technology, which is referred to as Quantum computing (QC). On the quantum level,
    the major goal is to define the nature and character of energy systematically.
    QC has always required a lot of growth from the last million areas to increase
    the capacity of quantum computers, just like the evolution from a simple CPU to
    today's supercomputer. QC can be easily understood by knowing the ideas of quantum
    laws of physics, through which high processing power is created and capacity is
    developed to various states, each of which aids in the execution of tasks in parallel
    combinations. In general, QC is based on quantum rules of physics since quantum
    physics atoms provide various advantages and nuclei properties, which are defined
    as quantum physics laws, and QC is enabled by these properties to work together
    as quantum bits, or simply qubits, to be the processor or memory of a computer.
    This study will demonstrate the use of CC in our daily lives, either directly
    or indirectly. In a nutshell, the practice of storing, retrieving, and processing
    data and processes over the net instead of on computers is known as CC. CC encompasses
    a wide range of concepts and words. As the system has some flaws, the same is
    true for CC, which has repercussions due to its flaws. As a result, the new service
    is referred to as Quantum Cloud as a Service (QCaaS). Our main goal is to give
    a summary of empirical analysis of security-enabled QC for the Cloud environment.

  zh: 云计算的概念最早是由谷歌的首席执行官在 2006 年 8 月的搜索引擎大会（Sessane Jose 2006）上首次提出的。"云"一词指的是云计算中的云服务。由于过去三十年来计算和信息技术的巨大进步，计算机世界现在可以设想过渡到云计算时代[[1](#CR1)]。近年来，云计算（CC）在学术实践、工业活动和政府运作的各个方面都有了显著增长。CC加速了安全技术的进步，并且互联网服务的使用显著增加。在银行业的情况下，CC是跨银行网络传输机密数据的有效工具[[2](#CR2)]。这种数据传输在数据保护和维护其完整性、服务质量、流动性、互操作性和可移植性方面面临严重的云安全问题。在这个领域，量子云计算（QCC）理论着眼于发展基于计算机技术的概念，这被称为量子计算（QC）。在量子水平上，主要目标是系统地定义能量的性质和特征。QC总是需要从上百万领域的最后一个发展，以增加量子计算机的能力，就像从简单的CPU发展到今天的超级计算机一样。通过了解量子物理定律的思想，QC可以轻松理解，通过这些定律，高处理能力被创建，并且能力被发展到各种状态，每种状态都有助于在并行组合中执行任务。一般来说，QC基于量子物理定律，因为量子物理学提供了各种各样的优点和核心属性，这些被定义为量子物理定律，QC通过这些属性被启用为量子位或简称为量子位，成为计算机的处理器或内存。本研究将展示CC在我们的日常生活中的使用，无论是直接还是间接。简而言之，将数据和过程存储、检索和处理在网络上而不是在计算机上的实践称为CC。CC涵盖了各种概念和术语。由于系统存在一些缺陷，CC也是如此，这些缺陷会产生一些后果。因此，新服务被称为量子云服务（QCaaS）。我们的主要目标是对云环境中启用安全的QC进行经验分析的摘要。

    occurrences. It beautifully blends “physics”, “mathematics”, “computer science”,
    and “information theory”. By manipulating the behavior of small physical objects,
    it gives great computational capacity, low energy usage, and exponential speed
    above traditional computers. QC is a fascinating new field that combines mathematics,
    computer science, and physics. It is concerned with the use of quantum physics
    to improve compute performance. A gentle introduction to some of the concepts
    of QC is presented here.Table 1

- en: The quantum computer's architecture is made up of both standard and quantum
    components, and there are five layers to it, each of which represents a functional
    component of the computer (as shown by Fig. [1](#Fig1)). The application layer,
    which is not part of the quantum computer but is critical to the entire system,
    is at the top of the heap. It includes everything needed to put together the relevant
    algorithms, such as “a programming environment”, “a quantum computer OS”, and
    “a user interface”. This layer can be used to create entirely quantum algorithms,
    but it can also be used to create algorithms with a mix of classical and quantum
    components. The traditional-processing layer sits directly beneath the application
    layer and performs main roles as per the responsibility provided for the same.
    It begins by optimizing and compiling the quantum algorithm currently being used.
    This is similar to what happens in the CPU of a traditional computer, which processes
    numerous microinstructions for each machine-code instruction it must execute.
    This layer also handles the quantum-state measurements supplied by the hardware
    in the layers below, which can then be fed back into a traditional algorithm to
    generate final results. The digital-, analog-, and quantum-processing layers sit
    beneath the classical layer, forming a quantum processing unit (QPU). The three
    layers of the QPU are inextricably linked, and the design of one is heavily influenced
    by the design of the other two.![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: The properties of QC are depicted in Fig. [2](#Fig2). Superposition is a concept
    in quantum physics that claims that any two quantum states can be combined to
    generate a new effective quantum state. In quantum physics, it is a fundamental
    idea. On the other hand, we can assert that any quantum state is made up of two
    or more different states. In quantum physics, superposition refers to a quantum
    system's ability to exist in two separate places or at the same time states. It
    enables amazing parallel processing at high speeds and is unlike its traditional
    cousins, which are limited to binary operations.![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png)

  zh: QC的性质如图[2](#Fig2)所示。叠加是量子物理中的一个概念，它声称任何两个量子状态都可以组合起来生成一个新的有效量子状态。在量子物理中，这是一个基本的思想。另一方面，我们可以断言任何量子状态都是由两个或更多不同状态组成的。在量子物理中，叠加指的是量子系统存在于两个不同地点或同时状态的能力。它使得惊人的并行处理以高速进行，与其传统的表兄弟不同，后者受限于二进制操作。![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png)

    between two quantum particles, also known as qubits, is referred to like this
    (physical features of systems). In nature, electrons separated at a great distance
    from one another within an electron cloud are extremely entangled. In QC, classical
    physics, interference is akin to wave interference. Using the concept of interference,
    this study will demonstrate purposefully skew the qubit's content to favor the
    correct state [[4](#CR4)].

    QC with error correction (as shown by Fig. [3](#Fig3)) [[5](#CR5)–[8](#CR8)].
    QC algorithms like “Fourier transform-based quantum algorithms (QA)”, “amplitude
    amplification-based QA”, “quantum walks-based algorithm”, “BQP-complete problems”,

    used to provide the infrastructure through virtual machines that are obsolete
    in recent times. It occurs as a result of a discrepancy between cloud security
    and virtual machine security [[13](#CR13)]. Moreover, it also includes an issue
    related to compatibility due to the usage of legacy software by the client. Thus,
    the physical resources of virtual machines are split to maintain the security
    of the hypervisor. The system of PaaS acts as a server in programming activities.
    Security issues related to PaaS occur due to fault tolerance, vulnerability of
    the history system, privacy authentication issues, interoperation, and others.![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig5_HTML.png)

- en: CC is seen as an emerging model with a substantial number of potential growth
    elements. On the other hand, it has a wide range of value in respect to its application
    [[17](#CR17)]. Despite having unique characteristics, several security threats
    are associated with this system that creates challenges regarding protection.
    Major three factors are included in this security issues such as integrity, confidentiality,
    and availability of data [[18](#CR18)]. The security issues regarding confidential
    factors come from an insider that makes a client’s information vulnerable to the
    risk of an external attack. It can be caused by illegal access to the client information
    from the insider member associated with a cloud service provider. An outside attack
    also creates such risks that include an attack by remote software or hardware
    on cloud clients. Leakage of information due to manual disruption, inadequate
    instruments, failure of secured access, and others also create confidentiality-related
    risks in a cloud-based system. Integrity threats are associated with poor control
    over client access and create risks around the quality of information. An inadequate
    design of virtual machines and a lack of security parameters create integrity
    threats in a cloud-based network [[19](#CR19)]. Another threat related to availability
    occurs due to non-accessibility of information, inadequate recovery policies,
    and physical interruptions. It is found that an inadequate recuperation technique
    also leads to an insufficient failure recovery that adversely impacts the time
    of recovery along with its effectiveness. Apart from the above-mentioned threats
    four major attacks also impact the cloud computing framework in an adverse manner.
    These are based on networks, virtual machines, associated storage units, and applications
    [[20](#CR20)]. Network-based attacks occur due to the intrusion of hackers into
    a network during port checking. Multiple security issues become vulnerable due
    to VM-based attacks and application-based attacks include malware infusion, stenography
    attacks, convention-based attacks, and others as depicted in Fig. [7](#Fig7).![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig7_HTML.png)

    security threats of malicious usage of CC networks in a dynamic computing environment

    support in detecting the security issues and preventing their occurrence. On the
    other hand, certain unnecessary alerts are also generated from this system that
    creates problems in detecting the actual danger [[26](#CR26)]. This system, on
    the other hand, is effective for detecting systems with security issues, recording
    existing dangers, and keeping participants affiliated with information exchange
    with security policies. Attaining a parallel processing activity by preventing
    the occurrence of distributed computing security risks is the benefit of this

- en: Whenever a problem arises in either conventional or QCC, improvement is still
    being made. All we need is powerful QCs capable of simultaneously generating multiple
    qubits, quantum protocols, and the right communication media. Google has already
    discovered that the approaches used by d-wave will be used in their first quantum
    computer. By improving the hardware of the d-wave, they plan to design Qubits
    in a new way. The main machine chip of the recent d-wave has 512 Qubits. They
    developed the measurement-based quantum computation theoretical framework; it
    provides a way for a user to send a computation to a quantum server. On September
    27, 2013, a group of scientists from Bristol University in the United Kingdom
    demonstrated a quantum-cloud device. Qcloud is the name given to this endeavor.
    The Qcloud quantum computer is housed in Bristol University’s quantum photonics
    facility. The goal is to establish QC as a service in a feasible way (QCaaS) [[27](#CR27)].
    Anyone in the globe would be able to access and manage this quantum processor
    remotely. It would allow users to conduct an experiment and compare the results
    to their models. They are, however, just employing 2 Qubits. This is a recent
    illustration of how QC and CC can be used in the real world. Long-distance quantum
    key transmission necessitates the use of a quantum repeater. We can use photons’
    “spooky behavior at a distance” to our advantage. Because of a relationship between
    two entangled pairs [[28](#CR28)]. Zeilinger and his colleagues used entanglement
    to “teleport” information over 600 m across the Danube, conveyed by a third photon.
    The Qubits in a key could be transported across continents or seas if this technique
    could be extended to many relays [[29](#CR29)]. Opportunities for quantum computing
    research, in a nutshell, are shown in Fig. [10](#Fig10).![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig10_HTML.png)

    parties can read it [[30](#CR30)]. In public-key encryption techniques, the encryption
    key is made available to everyone for use in encrypting messages. Only the recipient
    party has access to the decryption key that allows it to read messages. Various
    encryption algorithms include “Triple DES”, “Twofish encryption algorithm”, “Blowfish
    encryption algorithm”, “Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)”, “IDEA encryption
    algorithm”, “MD5 encryption algorithm”, “HMAC encryption algorithm”, “RSA security”,
    “RC4—Also known as ARC4”, “ECC Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm”, “W7”, “MARS”,
    “RC 2”, “RC 5”, “RC 6”, “Threefish”, “Serpent”, “Diffie-Hellman”, “Elliptic Curve”,
    “SHA 1” and so on (as shown by Fig. [11](#Fig11)). Its importance can be felt
    because security breaches cost organizations lots of money if the safe transmission
    of data is missed.![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig11_HTML.png)

    ciphertext after encryption. Data encryption is intentionally performed during
    storage or when moved from one node to another to protect sensitive information.
    Confidentiality properties such as “data integrity”, “data authentication” as
    well as “non-cancellation” capabilities come with modern encryption tools. The
    data sender is detected and checked through authentication; the honesty function
    shows that the content of the data is not skewed, while the non-cancellation property
    guarantees that the person who sends the data does not reject it. To spread the
    cryptographic keys among the sensor nodes, an appropriate key management system
    should therefore be built. In cryptography, encryption is the process of encrypting
    a message or information such that only authorized parties can read it and no
    one else can. Asymmetric Encryption and Symmetric Encryption are two types of
    encryption methods. The encryption key is made available for everyone to use and
    encrypt messages in public-key encryption systems. Only the receiving party has
    access to the decryption key, which permits messages to be read. For the first
    time, public-key encryption was explained in a classified document in 1973\. All
    encryption systems before that were symmetric-key (also called private-key). In
    symmetric-key schemes, the encryption and decryption keys are the same. Communicating
    parties must have the same key to achieve secure communication. These techniques
    can also be used to secure cloud communication for end-users in the Quantum internet
    system. The quantum internet relies solely on photon transmission; when we transfer
    encrypted data to the cloud, the data can be modified quickly if someone intercepts
    it. Finally, the end-user will be able to determine whether or not the communication
    was intercepted during transmission after receiving the data. As a result, if
    we wish to build a quantum internet, the security mechanism will dramatically
    improve. A method for high-fidelity, long-distance communication teleportation
    of qubits has been created by a team of researchers [[31](#CR31)] from the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology (MIT) and North-western University (NU) [[18](#CR18)].

    with accuracy. If Alice and Bob both check the polarizations but Bob is unable
    to decode the data, then hacker communication interference will be detected quickly.

- en: Recent tests on quantum principles have revealed two different approaches to
    securing cloud systems. One method is known as blind computing, in which the quantum
    processed computer is unaware of all input and data processing. According to blind
    computing, the cloud user builds Qubit and is only aware of early states. After
    delivering these Qubits to the quantum computer, the computer uses a normal mechanism
    to assemble the Qubits. The calculation itself is based on measurement. The user
    applies these measures’ rules to the individual condition of each quantum bit.
    The user is returned to his result after a few seconds of successful processing
    and can receive the concluding outcome. The entire process is “blind,” in the
    sense that no relevant information will be received if a QCs attempts to decode
    the Qubit. It is because they are unaware of the original conditions. Quantum
    cryptography using quantum internet systems is another option, in which photon
    polarization filters are used to encrypt and decrypt data [[33](#CR33)].

    has the potential to disrupt businesses. QC is still being developed through university
    courses and job paths, according to [[34](#CR34)] Bob Sutor, vice president of
    IBM Quantum Ecosystem Development. Similarly, big cloud providers are focusing
    solely on education at this early stage. “Today's cloud services are geared at
    preparing the industry for the soon-to-arrive day when quantum computers become
    usable, said Itamar Sivan, co-founder, and CEO of Quantum Machines, a quantum
    computing orchestration platform” [[34](#CR34)].

    cloud computing, allowing users to write and run short programs on a quantum computer
    over the internet. Since IBM first introduced the concept of cloud-based quantum
    computing, other computer behemoths have been eager to try it out. As a result,
    tech giants like “Google”, “Amazon”, and “Microsoft” have decided to follow IBM’s
    lead. In 2019, Microsoft unveiled ‘Azure Quantum,’ a service that gives users
    access to quantum algorithms, hardware, and software [[35](#CR35)]. Figure [12](#Fig12)
    shows the integration of quantum cloud which enhanced the security of QCC, provide
    high speed, give large storage, and have QCC as a service for the QCC environment.![](../images/516210_1_En_3_Chapter/516210_1_En_3_Fig12_HTML.png)

- en: Because quantum technology is still in its early stages of development, numerous
    problems must be addressed before it can be used on a big scale in machines. Quantum
    measurement exposes a similar component of the state, which is a complete superposition
    of the probable states of the relevant qubits involved with normalized amplitudes
    of varying probabilities [[31](#CR31)]. As a result, the precise state of a system
    cannot be established. This constraint makes it difficult to assess the cost of
    quantum calculations using the quantum complexity theory [[31](#CR31)]. Its importance
    may grow as the number of measurement devices necessary for some polynomial-time
    quantum algorithms grows. Even though it is a research difficulty, it can be used
    to overcome decoherence, which is another quantum cloud limitation. The quantum
    measurement is used in the entanglement protection strategy, which can effectively
    avoid even entanglement abrupt death (ESD). Entanglement in multiple parts understanding
    and manipulating multipartite entangled states is crucial for distributed quantum
    computing and networks and thus plays a key role in quantum error correction codes
    [[31](#CR31)]. Because, according to [[6](#CR6)], entanglement cannot be exchanged
    among separate particles, determining the bounds and possibilities of multipartite
    entanglement is a fascinating scientific topic. In the field of computation theory,
    determining the computational capacity of quantum cellular automata versus quantum
    turing machines remains a challenge. For the 10 efficient implications of a quantum
    infrastructure in a cloud environment, quantum clouds must meet these problems.
    Cloud quantum processors capable of doing quantum computation on a larger and
    more reliable scale have been the subject of extensive technological development.
    Trapped ions, liquid-state NMR, and electron spin transistors are some of the
    techniques proposed and used in the development of these qubit processors, but
    the challenges associated with them are setting up an “initial state”, “stabilizing
    quantum memory”, “performing measurement readouts”, and “battling decoherence”.
    For practical application in Quantum clouds, the scope of qubit processors needs
    to be expanded so that they can handle the burden of the information to be processed.
    The challenge of developing quantum–classical interface protocols is still relatively
    new, given that once we have implemented a basic quantum computer and devised
    the necessary quantum algorithms, the next step would be to develop an interface
    between classical and quantum infrastructure, as quantum clouds will use classical
    infrastructure. It is necessary to build networking protocols that can combine
    quantum as well as classical levels, as well as the application of ideas such
    as blind QC and quantum cryptography.

    reliability for the end-user. As we have shown, quantum computing principles can
    solve all of the problems associated with cloud computing, but only if quantum
    cloud computing is fully developed for the future. IBM announced a new supercomputing
    processor for cloud computers at Census. However, quantum computation continues
    to be questioned by a wired magazine. Quantum computations have a lot of drawbacks,
    according to several businesses. The following are the primary concerns: Is the
    d wave''s gigantic black box a quantum computer? Is it possible to exert influence
    at the subatomic level? What is the most efficient approach to make a new gate
    for operating Qubits? How will we avoid the photon''s noise effect? The QCs will
    function as a classical computer if a modest quantity of noise disentangles the
    Qubits. Also, “how do you parallelize a big number of Qubits (1000)?”. “How much
    portability does it have?”. There are still a lot of questions to be answered.
    As a result, QCC is possible. We hope that our continued progress in quantum computation
    will usher in a revolution and pave the way for a better quantum-cloud system
    in the future.'

    In terms of security, processing, and operating, quantum cloud computing outperforms
    traditional cloud computing. In this work, every way we can think of, along with
    appropriate examples, to demonstrate the evolution of quantum clouds computing.
    Quantum cloud as a service (Qcaas) is a new technique that will be available in
    the future. As quantum approaches, we must continue to study and evolve to create
    adaptable businesses and firms that provide the finest services. We hope that
    it will continue to evolve in the future, ushering in a new revolution and ushering
    in the finest future possible. CC is always questioned if there is no guarantee
    of security and reliability for the end-user. As we have shown, QC principles
    can solve all of the problems associated with cloud computing, but only if QCC
    is fully developed for the future.
