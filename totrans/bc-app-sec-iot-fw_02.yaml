- en: Smart Grid is defined as an intelligent electrical distribution system that
    offers bi-directional energy, which flows from producers to consumers, intending
    to optimize use to reduce costs and improve the performance of the electricity
    network, which requires a balance between generators, operators, and system distributors,
    providing benefits , including reduced power losses, lower costs, and better measurement
    of consumption with better control, enabling a reduction in carbon emissions.
    With sensors installed in the electrical networks sending data related to energy
    consumption directly from the consumer unit, they enable more effective and efficient
    network planning. Besides, the network is designed to reduce the occurrence and
    duration of power outages as much as possible. In it, electromechanical consumption
    meters are replaced by digital smart meters, representing a true revolution in
    energy supply, meaning that the Smart Grid is a system that automates not only
    the monitoring but the entire management of electricity use. This chapter contributes
    to the discussion and overview of Smart Grids, their applications in the current
    era, as well as categorizing and synthesizing the technology's potential.

    Grids are an essential pillar for its achievement. The spread of renewable energy
    sources has led to a profound modernization of traditional electricity distribution
    systems and how they are effectively distributed. Smart Grid is defined as an
    intelligent electrical distribution system that delivers bi-directional energy
    flows from producers to consumers. Unlike traditional power grids, where power
    is generated by only one plant and distributed to end customers through the large
    transformer and substation networks, in Smart Grid, end customers also act as
    producers [[1](#r1), [2](#r2)].

    a series of digital transformation projects, such as reducing car traffic in major
    cities and energy consumption. In addition to its use in home life, IoT promises
    to revolutionize industries, the security market, and even the medical field.
    Electricity consumption was also largely impacted by technology. Efforts are being
    made to design and implement energy-efficient networks that use Smart Grid parameters
    and apply the Internet of Things, making it possible for the network to work in

    management of its use. In parallel with the search for sustainability, digital
    transformation has also added to the creation of new possibilities for managing
    this resource. The concept of this trend refers to a new power distribution architecture
    that can automate all management of electricity use. For the Smart Grid to function,
    it is necessary to switch analog meters to digital meters. These are safer, and
    especially intelligent, devices that enable the integration of information between

    skills to an electricity distribution system. In recent times, this concept has
    gained a lot of prominences , especially in Smart Grid projects that seek to improve
    operations, maintenance, and planning, ensuring that each component of the power
    grid can “talk” and “listen.”It is, therefore, a highly automated, efficient,
    self-healing, a bi-directional pathway of energy, enabling i nterconnected communications

    is disrupted if a customer calls in a Smart Grid scenario, the company will immediately
    know why certain network components, such as the use of smart meters in the affected
    area, have stopped to send sensor data. By ensuring that all network components,
    from transformers and power lines to household, commercial and industrial electrical
    meters, have IP addresses and are capable of using bidirectional communication,
    the company can manage distribution more efficiently. Also, it needs to be proactive
    in maintenance and respond to outages faster. So, another important component

    to avoid waste and set goals to improve the company's energy consumption. Also,

    taking into account that each household has its own network, consisting of a HAN
    (Home Area Network) which is the smallest of the networks and is present in each
    residence, and is composed of microgeneration’s of each household, such as solar
    panels on the roof of the houses and smart energy-consuming devices, it connects
    these smart, energy-consuming devices, and micro-generations if any. Regarding
    all information and data related to the electrical consumption and energy production
    of each HAN, the occurrence of blackouts, and the overall quality of energy use
    are stored in a smart meter [[33](#r33)].

    a NAN (Neighborhood Area Network), since the energy demand of several NANs in
    a region is sent to a data concentrator, which processes this information and
    sends it to the concessionaire, considering also that each such NAN network sends
    the information to a data concentrator, which is connected to the measurement
    management center *via* a WAN (Wide Area Network) network. Thus, a HAN is the
    home network, at that same level there is the BAN (Bussiness Area Network), which
    is a type of commercial network; the NAN would be the neighborhood network comprising
    multiple HAN; and finally, the WAN encompasses multiple NANs. In the same way
    that a type of protocol is necessary for this communication since many of the
    meters and sensors, smart generators, and other IoT devices have some type of
    information processing done by microprocessors, it is convenient to use communication
    protocols similar to those of computer networks [[34](#r34)].

    error checking, addressing services (data link layer), transport (transport layer)
