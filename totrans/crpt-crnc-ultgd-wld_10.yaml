    hear many positive things about it. At the same time, you might hear many raise
    questions and doubts about its legitimacy. Like all other currencies, many good
    things can be said about it, but it is not all that glitter are gold either. There
    are many valid and legitimate claims that present genuine risks as well.

- en: 'Transparency: When trading in digital currency all transactions are recorded
    and monitored. When a transaction has been completed, it is added to the ledger,
    and it becomes a permanent part of the record. This information cannot be manipulated
    or altered in any way. No individual or organization can change it making it one
    of the most secure of all transactions.'

    Internet you can trade in cryptocurrency, but because it is not backed by any
    geographical boundaries or governmental institutions, it is accepted and used
    in most countries of the world. That cannot be said about any other traditional
    currency in the world.'

    are a mere fraction of the fees that most financial institutions charge which
    makes it extremely appealing. The larger the transaction, the more you''ll benefit
    from this as it can save you hundreds upon thousands of dollars.'

    are digital and encrypted; you cannot be ripped off in a transaction as you can
    be with legacy payment systems, and it is much harder to steal cryptocurrency
    compared to a full wallet cash. In a world where so many of our transactions are
    online, and our savings and credit rating are at stake at all times, anything
    that provides increased transactional security is a plus. And there is currently
    no transaction mechanism that is more safe and secure than those that use cryptocurrency.'

- en: 'You Control Your Money: Void of any middleman or third-party interests, no
    one is in charge of your money. There is no other electronic cash system in which
    your account isn’t owned by someone else. Take PayPal, for example: if the company
    decides for some reason that your account has been misused, it has the power to
    freeze all of the assets held in the account, without consulting you. It is then
    up to you to jump through whatever hoops are necessary to get it cleared so that
    you can access your funds. With cryptocurrency, you own the private key and the
    corresponding public key that makes up your cryptocurrency address. No one can
    take that away from you (unless you lose it yourself, or host it with a web-based
    wallet service that loses it for you).'

- en: 'Lack of Acceptance: One of the biggest negatives with cryptocurrencies is their
    newness. While users can do a lot of things with them; buy, sell, trade, or purchase
    but it is not like the whole world would accepts them like they do VISA or American
    Express. Finding vendors that are willing to accept crypto for the payment of
    goods and services is not always easy. Until it is, users will have to exchange
    their currency for local currency to make most purchases.'

    are not. When you are ready to invest, it is important to remember that it should
    be treated more like a commodity. Prices can fluctuate wildly depending on the
    flow of the market. If you view it more as a long-term investment, then you won''t
    be sidetracked by the constant price fluctuations.'

    of this book. Cryptocurrencies cannot be recovered if they are lost. Unlike financial
    institutions that have regulations to protect your investment, a single incident
    of hacking could literally wipe you out. For that reason, keeping your currency
    off the Internet when not in an active trade is the best way to protect your investment.'

    in perspective. It is still in development, and there will likely be many changes
    coming in the future. Investors must be prepared to accept and adapt to these
    changes before the system is fully perfected.'
