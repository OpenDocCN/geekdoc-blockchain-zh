    a further use case exploration of Smart Contracts implementation. One of the main
    challenges in BIM workflows is the traceability of changes within a BIM model
    and closely coupled with it, the accountability for clearances and the sharing
    of model information. We argue that the different value chain activities, actors,
    and digital assets in the design phase could be linked on the basis of Blockchain
    (BC) and Smart Contracts (SC). Our BIMd.sign framework shows mainly three factors
    why BC and SC can be considered to deliver benefits to a BIM-based process if
    implemented: documentation, traceability, and transparency. We argue that the
    gained information from this analysis will give enough insight to evaluate the
    needed “level of detail” of repeating acts or sequences, in which traceability
    through SC can deliver a sufficient supplement respectively optimization for planning
    processes in the design phase. Furthermore, based on our research, we suggest
    that possible applications of SC in the design phase require a transformation
    of existing workflows for the implementation of digital technologies.'

    phase and planning processes of building projects, has not been sufficiently addressed
    so far or found its application in practice, although numerous pieces of the literature
    suggest possible theoretical or conceptual applications of this technology in
    the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) industry [[14](#CR14), [18](#CR18),
    [30](#CR30)]. As far as research shows, AEC could potentially benefit from the
    implementation of BC and SC [[25](#CR25), [32](#CR32)] and gain efficiency in
    the design phase of a building project through more transparency and traceability.
    Nevertheless, the applied technology has to be analyzed through the lens of a
    sociotechnical system and its applicability for differing value chain activities
    existing in the design, construction, and operational phase.

    been developed so far, including: (1) a conceptual framework for process modeling
    and (2) a 3A pattern for process analysis, needed for the digitalization of the
    design phase. A prototype with a demonstration application is currently in its
    development stage and therefore not the focus of this chapter. In our research,
    we argue that the different value chain activities, actors and digital assets
    in the design phase could be linked on the basis of BC and SC. Hence in the first
    step, a developed methodological framework for the analysis of design workflows,
    which is a combination of three underlying theories—design, configuration, and
    task-technology fit, is presented. In the second step, based on a quantitative
    study, a 3A pattern analysis is displayed. The pattern divides each process into
    three sub-layers: stakeholders (actors), data (assets), and processes (activities).
    This separation into three layers ensures a highly detailed representation of
    the processes, showing the sequenced work of the stakeholders and the occurring
    communication and collaboration during the design phase. The used method allows
    identification of iterating processes as well, which can be seen on two different
    levels: a repeating act (a singular action) in the regular process, or a repeating
    sequence (a number of actions in the same order) due to insufficient outcomes.
    Based on the framework for process modeling and the 3A pattern, which are extended
    into the BIMd.sign framework, a conceptual application of SC in the design phase
    is proposed, grounded in a use case, where we explore the process/workflow, domain-specific
    data exchange, stakeholders, and existing iterating processes in practice. The
    BIMd.sign framework focuses herewith on the design phase and the use of BC and
    SC for traceable documentation of the delivery and approval of BIM models. Thus,
    important activities and decisions during the design phase are documented transparently.'

    different participants that each perform a specific role in a building project

    where dependencies need to be understood [[22](#CR22)] in order to be managed.
    Design process definitions exist in various forms as plans of work and services
    or organizational models in building projects—specific to a country (e.g., [[17](#CR17),
    [26](#CR26), [35](#CR35)]) or field, such as project management [[33](#CR33)].
    They explain the stages, their desired core tasks and outcomes, as well as necessary
    information exchanges in each stage. Although this literature on design processes
    can be useful as a point of departure for further development—since it promotes
    common structures in the highly heterogeneous AEC industry, it can also slow down
    innovation while referring to traditional workflows without considering the latest
    technological developments [[43](#CR43)].

    are to be fully realized [[43](#CR43)]. There are approaches to standardize the
    processes as information delivery manuals (IDMs) [[19](#CR19), [20](#CR20)], which
    originate from the work of the buildingSmart organization. buildingSmart [[6](#CR6)]
    recognizes that the development of IDMs is difficult for some domains, and that
    it should be accompanied by software development. IDM is a standard, which “*provides
    help in getting the full benefit from a BIM*” [[19](#CR19)]. It describes a methodology
    to identify and describe processes within the context of BIM to support use cases
    by providing the information of a satisfactory quality at the required time. It
    is another component, which forms a fundamental part of our analysis framework.
    Nevertheless, for our research purposes, a deviation from IDMs was necessary—where
    the focus is on the detail of the comprehensive procedures of the complete project;
    whereas our framework connects aspects from a theoretical point of view and a
    practice point of view, delivering an integrative configurational fit of task-technology-people,
    embedded in an organizational structure resp. environment. Additionally, the focus
    in our presented conceptual model development is on smaller and more scaled process
    scenarios, which furthermore are the entry points for an SC implementation.

    are often not clearly separable and are partly dependent on each other [[3](#CR3)].
    On the basis of BC, the immutability of the data is one of the key factors for
    its implementation in the AEC. Oraee et al. [[31](#CR31)] describe this property
    as the starting point for better collaborations in the context of BIM projects.
    A so-called “BIM execution plan” (BeP), in combination with SCs, could help to
    define services and deliverables and accelerate their implementation. The definition
    of responsibility is also highlighted by Dounas et al. [[13](#CR13)]. Another
    effect that Dounas et al. [[13](#CR13)] emphasize is the possibility of creating
    decentralized planning teams, as intellectual property and BIM models can be referenced
    through BC due to the transparency of data and the traceability of the origin
    of this data [[31](#CR31)]. Perera et al. [[32](#CR32)] see traceability as an
    essential tool to operate an efficient asset management. While asset management
    is only mentioned as a secondary benefit in the digital area, Cecconi et al. [[8](#CR8)]
    describe BIM as a digital object-oriented process and combine asset management
    with BIM models.

    versions of the BIM models would be verified and used as a log in the case of
    legal disputes. This could make the resolution of such disputes much easier, if

    and coordinated collaboration and information management. Common Data Environments
    (CDEs) offer further support in terms of data exchange and collaboration. CDEs
    are […] internet-based platforms for the management of processes and information
    in all phases of the life cycle of a building [[12](#CR12), p. 9]. They serve
    as a platform for the exchange of data and information in a regulated environment
    [[34](#CR34)]. In Srećković et al. [[41](#CR41)] the CDE is defined as a combination
    of different technologies that promote the exchange of information. An “Information
    Container for linked Document Delivery” [[11](#CR11)] is used, in which the exchanged
    data, structured (e.g. geometry models, XML files, mass calculations, etc.) or
    unstructured (photos, PDF files, etc.) are filed (see use case). A CDE is a well-suited
    and secure data storage for digital assets in construction projects. Storing a
    large amount of data on a public BC is very expensive and not efficient, otherwise
    private BC is critical in terms of security and trust. Hence, it is proposed to
    keep all the sensitive and important information in a centralized off-chain storage.
    Thus, only unique cryptographic hashes of the files deposited in the CDE can be
    recorded on the BC.

    planning requires an analysis from different points of view. In order to investigate
    a BIM workflow during the design phase of a building project, and keep the focus
    on process modeling, a framework was developed, based on three underlying theories—design,
    configuration, and task-technology fit as presented in Table [1](#Tab1) and Fig. [1](#Fig1).
    The conceptual framework shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1) connects theory and practice.
    The analysis framework constitutes the connection between people, organization,
    and technology interaction. Hence, the design of a process with a task-technology-configurational
    fit requires an adaptive interaction of implemented processes (through people),
    organization (actions and delivery order), and technology (software and data)

    and other design resources between the project stakeholders [[16](#CR16)], which
    are included in numerous processes in the building design phase (e.g., information
    process, data management process, BIM workflow). In practice, these processes
    are not linear or rigid, but rather dynamic and very complex. Hence, workflow
    is more than a technique to model a process. It is a method to analyze and improve
    a process, including its modeling. ***Processes*** are relationships between inputs
    and outputs, where inputs are transformed into outputs using a series of activities
    or tasks which add value to the inputs [[2](#CR2)]. One or more software systems,
    one or a team of humans, or a combination of these can perform a task. ***Task-technology
    fit*** (TTF) is the degree to which a technology supports the performance of tasks,
    where task requirements, individual abilities and the functionality of technology
    are in accordance [[15](#CR15)]. In the context of TTF theory, technology has
    to match business processes [[23](#CR23)], enabling a tight coupling of IT function,
    business strategy, and the organization’s information needs [[42](#CR42)].

    3A method [[38](#CR38)], patterns are recognized by analyzing the actor, activity,
    and asset sequences separately as well as their combinations. In the later presented
    BIMd.sign framework, the 3A analysis divides the design workflow into actor, action,
    and asset from a single sub-process in the design process. The definition of an
    ***actor*** from ISO [[19](#CR19)] being a “person, organization or organizational
    unit involved in a construction process”. Further on, ISO [[19](#CR19)] distinguishes
    two types of actors: initiator who makes a request and executor who responds to
    the request. ***Activity*** is used as an atomic sub-process of a design phase,
    required for digitalization purposes. We consider the process a sequence of activities,
    which transforms inputs into outputs. ***Assets*** as in Succar and Poirier [[43](#CR43)]
    are addressing both digital and physical assets used in construction. They are
    interrelated, whereby the digital ones can be documents, models, and data. The
    patterns were identified by statistical analysis of the 3As, where multiple sequences
    of actor, activity, and asset were compared. For this quantitative analysis, in
    total 100 listings of protocols and respective process documentation of two existing
    building projects, at different stages in the design process were explored, which
    is explained in more detail in Sibenik et al. [[38](#CR38)]. This quantitative
    analysis enabled the patterns extrapolation and discovery of commonly occurring
    sequences that provide a base for future automation of processes. Our approach
    was validated by BC experts involved with the project BIMd.sign, who expressed
    their views regarding the required scope of the design activities information,
    for supporting and eventually automating the workflows with BC. They acknowledged
    the usefulness and usability of the 3A analysis for future implementation, especially
    due to a lack of documented workflows on the building element level.'

    the relevant participating actors. Hence, SCs would facilitate the traceability
    of relevant modifications in the digital model, where the author and date of a
    change would be documented on the BC. Furthermore, process steps, which are executed

    addressing function, form, budget, and time [[7](#CR7)], as well as the evaluation
    of the delivered digital and physical assets. At the end of each process or stage
    in the design phase, the GP presents the results to the client, who either accepts
    to move forward or requires changes, which end in iteration until the design is

    planner) is responsible to check if the uploaded model fulfills all the domain-specific
    requirements. If not approved, a list of required changes is uploaded for the
    architect, who modifies the design and uploads the updated model for the structural
    engineer to the CDE. If approved by the structural engineer, the architect then
    authorizes further steps. In this case, the SC would be able to document the changes
    and responsibilities of the involved actors, as well as give clearance for further
    steps, when all approvals are met, completing this SC and possibly triggering
    a new one. Hence, each of these steps is supported with an SC, which also partly

    the next steps by choosing an SC, which is regarded as another digital asset during

    SC, but it does not fully correspond to BIM-based workflows from the technical
    side. To further improve data management, the aim is to directly connect proprietary
    software tools with the central database.

- en: With our BIMd.sign framework, we have demonstrated how different value chain
    activities, actors, and digital assets in the design phase could be linked on
    the basis of BC and SC. This could lead to higher quality in building design,
    as well as faster and more efficient processes, due to an easy adaption for each
    project through modular sets of SCs. The information filtered from a BIM model
    could help to automatize certain tasks during a project and save redundant steps.
    This automatization requires a step-by-step description [[4](#CR4)] of each process
    and its possible outcomes to fully use all potentials. An overall automatization
    of all the BIM-based processes is not seen at this point, as there is a need for
    human input to start and direct certain processes [[28](#CR28)]. In addition,
    the high complexity of data exchange and a vast number of activities present in
    the design workflow, which are not standardized, make an effort for overall automatization
    impossible in practice so far.

    an issue, as each document was stamped and in paper version [[39](#CR39)], but
    due to BIM methods, the exchange rate of data increased drastically, which often
    leads to data loss and unused information [[14](#CR14)].'

    process integrity can be reached, which is transparent to all project stakeholders
    and agreed upon, before the project starts. This could foster and strengthen a
    new way of trust between the project stakeholders [[13](#CR13), [25](#CR25)].'

    in the design phases. SC can enable automatized reference-making on a BC and therefore
    create a revision-safe database. With a BIM element-based system, SCs facilitate
    the traceability of each change in the model. Author and date of a change, can
    be tracked on the BC. The traceability enforces a responsible decision-making
    process and can help avoid legal disputes upfront, as well as minimize the restraint
    of using BIM in an inter-organizational setting.'

- en: In conclusion, we argue, that the implementation of process-based SCs could
    foster a better environment for BIM-based projects, due to a required standardization
    of these processes, which would also deliver benefits in the form of efficiency
    and speed. Nevertheless, the identification of intersections between people (project-stakeholders),
    technology (data-flow and software), and tasks (process flow) has not yet been
    fully adjusted to the needed requirements for SCs. The next steps in our research
    will include exploitation of further scenarios and use cases, standardization
    of terms for SCs (taxonomy), and the development of a proof-of-concept application
    in the final stage of our research project. Furthermore, the significant digitalization
    potential identified within this research, will be realized as a high-quality
    meta-analysis of the 3A pattern in the future steps of BIMd.sign.
