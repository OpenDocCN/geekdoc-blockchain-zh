- en: Anxiety is perhaps the best way to describe the attitude that dominated the
    minds of investors and the general public toward financial markets by the end
    of 2008\. The 2008 financial crisis is considered by numerous economists to have
    been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The years leading
    up to the crisis saw a flood of irresponsible mortgage lending and a massive systemic
    failure of financial regulation and supervision. The fallout was so immense that
    it threatened the collapse of large financial institutions. National governments
    had to intercede to bail out major banks. This chapter begins with a discussion
    about the 2008 financial crisis, and then we discuss the aftermath, which led
    to an environment where a new banking system and alternative currency such as
    Bitcoin could thrive. Then, we dive into the technology stack that powers Bitcoin.
    Remarkably, the components of this stack are not entirely new, but they are strung
    together in an ingenious design. Finally, we end the discussion by talking about
    the heightened interest in blockchain, a major technical breakthrough that has
    the potential to revolutionize several industries.

    an unknown individual under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who dreamed of changing
    the financial world. Any number of parties can be blamed for the financial crisis,
    but the common denominator was that fundamental financial and accounting instruments
    used to maintain integrity of the entire system became too complex to be used
    efficiently. Trust, the ultimate adhesive of all financial systems, began to disappear
    in 2008\. The regulations have since changed to prevent similar circumstances
    from arising, but it was clear that there was a need for autoregulation of trust
    between counterparties and transparency into their ability to enter any type of
    a sales contract. A counterparty is essentially the other party in a financial
    transaction. In other words, it is the buyer matched to a seller. In financial
    transactions, one of the many risks involved is called counterparty risk , the
    risk that each party involved in a contract might not be able to fulfill its side
    of the agreement. The systemic failure referenced earlier can now be understood
    in terms of counterparty risk: Both parties in the transaction were accumulating
    massive counterparty risk, and in the end, both parties collapsed under the terms
    of the contract. Imagine a similar transaction scenario involving multiple parties,
    and now imagine that every single player in this scenario is a major bank or insurance
    company that further serves millions of customers. This is just what happened
    during the 2008 crisis.The next issue we need to discuss is that of double spending
    . We revisit this topic again strictly in the context of Bitcoin, but let’s get
    a basic understanding of the concept by applying it to the financial crisis. The
    principle behind double spending is that resources committed to one domain (e.g.,
    one transaction) cannot also be simulataneously committed to a second disparate
    domain. This concept has obvious implications for digital currencies, but it can
    also summarize some of the problems during the 2008 crisis.Here’s how it started:
    Loans (in the form of mortages) were given to borrowers with poor credit histories
    who struggled to repay them. These high-risk mortgages were sold to financial
    experts at the big banks, who packaged them into low-risk public stocks by putting
    large numbers of them together in pools. This type of pooling would work when
    the risks associated with each loan (mortgage) are not correlated. The experts
    at big banks hypothesized that property values in different cities across the
    country would change independently and therefore pooling would not be risky. This
    proved to be a massive mistake. The pooled mortage packages were then used to
    purchase a type of stock called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The CDOs
    were divided into tiers and sold to investors. The tiers were ranked and rated
    by financial standards agencies and investors bought the safest tiers based on
    those ratings. Once the U.S. housing market turned, it set off a domino effect,
    destroying everything in the way. The CDOs turned out to be worthless, despite
    the ratings. The pooled mortgages collapsed in value and all the packages being
    sold instantly vaporized. Throughout this complex string of transactions, every
    sale increased the risk and incurred double spending at multiple levels. Eventually,
    the system equilibrated, only to find massive gaps, and collapsed under the weight.
    Following is a brief timeline for 2008\. (This timeline was made following a presentation
    by Micah Winkelspech at Distributed Health, 2016).'

  zh: 革命常常看起来混乱不堪，但这一次却在暗中酝酿，由一个名叫中本聪的不知名个体领导，他梦想改变金融世界。金融危机可能归咎于许多各不相同的方面，但共同的因素是，用于维持整个系统完整性的基本金融和会计工具变得过于复杂，以至于无法高效使用。信任，所有金融体系的最终粘合剂，开始在2008年消失。自那以后，监管已经发生变化，以防止类似情况再次发生，但很明显，需要对交易方之间的信任进行自我调节，并透明地了解它们进入任何类型的销售合同的能力。交易对手本质上是金融交易中的另一方。换句话说，它是与卖方配对的买方。在金融交易中，涉及的许多风险之一被称为交易对手风险，即合同中的每一方可能无法履行其协议的一方。前文提到的系统性失败现在可以通过交易对手风险来理解：交易中的双方都在积累大量的交易对手风险，最终，双方都在合同条款下崩溃。想象一下涉及多方的类似交易场景，现在想象一下，这个场景中的每个玩家都是一家主要银行或保险公司，进一步为数百万客户服务。这就是2008年危机发生的情况。我们需要讨论的下一个问题是双花问题。我们将在后面严格讨论比特币的情况，但让我们先从将其应用于金融危机的基本概念开始。双花背后的原则是，承诺给一个领域的资源（例如，一个交易）不能同时承诺给第二个不同的领域。这个概念对数字货币有明显的影响，但它也可以总结出2008年危机的一些问题。事情是这样开始的：给信用历史较差的借款人发放贷款（以抵押贷款的形式），他们难以偿还。这些高风险抵押贷款被卖给大银行的金融专家，后者通过将它们大量组合成池，将它们打包成低风险的公共股票。当与每笔贷款（抵押贷款）相关的风险没有相关时，这种汇集工作。大银行的专家假设全国不同城市的房地产价值会独立变化，因此汇集工作不会有风险。这被证明是一个巨大的错误。汇集的抵押贷款包随后用于购买一种称为抵押债务证券（CDO）的股票类型。CDO被划分为层次，并出售给投资者。这些层次根据金融标准机构的标准和评级进行排名和评级，投资者根据这些评级购买最安全的层次。一旦美国房地产市场转向，它就引发了连锁反应，摧毁了一切。尽管有评级，但CDO被证明是一文不值的。汇集的抵押贷款价值暴跌，所有的包都瞬间化为乌有。在这一复杂的交易串中，每一次销售都增加了风险，并在多个层面上导致了双花。最终，系统达到平衡，但发现了巨大的空白，并在重压下崩溃。以下是2008年的简要时间线（此时间线是根据2016年分布式健康会议上
    Micah Winkelspech 的演示制作的）。

    the type of environment that would allow for Bitcoin to flourish. In November
    2008, a paper was posted on the Cryptography and Cryptography Policy Mailing List
    titled “ [Bitcoin : A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf),”
    with a single author named Satoshi Nakamoto. This paper detailed the Bitcoin protocol
    and along with it came the original code for early versions of Bitcoin. In some
    manner, this paper was a response to the economic crash that had just happened,
    but it would be some time before this technological revolution caught on. Some
    developers were concerned with this electronic cash system failing before it could
    ever take hold and their concern was scalability, as pointed out in Figure [1-1](#Fig1).![A430562_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-1.Initial reception of the Bitcoin protocol included concerns about scalability
    and realistic prospects for BitcoinSo who is Nakamoto? What is his background?
    The short and simple answer is that we don’t know. In fact, it is presumptuous
    to assume that he is actually a “he.” The name Satoshi Nakamoto was larely used
    as a pseudonym and he could have been a she, or even a they. Several reporters
    and news outlets have dedicated time and energy to digital forensics to narrow
    down candidates and find out the real identity of Nakamoto, but all the efforts
    so far have been [wild-goose chases](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/527051/the-man-who-really-built-bitcoin/).
    In this case, the community is starting to realize that maybe it doesn’t matter
    who Nakamoto is, because the nature of open source almost makes it irrelavent.
    Jeff Garzik, one of the most respected developers in the Bitcoin community, described
    it as follows: “Satoshi published an open source system for the purpose that you
    didn’t have to know who he was, and trust who he was, or care about his knowledge.”
    The true spirit of open source makes it so that the code speaks for itself, without
    any intervention from the creator or programmer.'

    generals’ problem. The solution was generalized with components and ideas borrowed
    from the cypherpunk community. We briefly talk about three of those ideas and
    the components they provided for the complete Bitcoin protocol: Hashcash for proof
    of work, Byzantine fault tolerance for the decentralized network, and blockchain
    to remove the need for centralized trust or a central authority. Let’s dive into
    each one, starting with Hashcash.Hashcash was devised by Adam Black in the late
    1990s to limit e-mail spam with the first of its kind Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.
    The rationale behind Hashcash was to attach some computational cost to sending
    e-mails. Spammers have a business model that relies on sending large numbers of
    e-mails with very little cost associated with each message. However, if there
    is even a small cost for each spam e-mail sent, that cost multiplies over thousands
    of e-mails, making their business unprofitable. Hashcash relies on the idea of
    cryptographic hash functions: A type of hash function (in the case of Bitcoin,
    SHA1) takes an input and converts it into a string that generates a message digest,
    as shown in Figure [1-2](#Fig2). The hash functions are designed to have a property
    called one-way functions, which implies that a potential input can be verified
    very easily through the hash function to match the digest, but reproducing the
    input from the digest is not feasible. The only possible method of re-creating
    the input is by using brute force to find the appropriate input string. In practice,
    this is the computationally intensive element of Hashcash and also eventually
    Bitcoin. This principle has become the foundation behind PoW algorithms powering
    Bitcoin today and most cryptocurrencies. The PoW for Bitcoin is more complex and
    involves new components, which we talk about at length in a later chapter.![A430562_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-2.Mechanism of a cryptographic hash function. It takes an input and consistently
    converts it to a string of an output digest.The next idea we need to discuss is
    the Byzantine generals’ problem. It is an agreement problem among a group of generals,
    with each one commanding a portion of the Byzantine army, ready to attack a city.
    These generals need to formulate a strategy for attacking the city and communicate
    it to each other adequately. The key is that every general agrees on a common
    decision, because a tepid attack by a few generals would be worse than a coordinated
    attack or a coordinated retreat. The crux of the problem is that some of the generals
    are traitorous. They might cast a vote to deceive the other generals and ultimately
    lead to a suboptimal strategy. Let’s take a look at an example: In a case of odd-numbered
    generals, say seven, three support attacking and three support retreat. The seventh
    general might communicate an agreement to the generals in favor of retreat, and
    an agreement to attack to the other generals, causing the whole arrangement to
    fall apart. The attacking forces fail to capture the city because no intrinsic
    central authority could verify the presence of trust among all seven generals.In
    this scenario, Byzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if all the loyal generals
    can communicate effectively to reach an undisputed agreement on their strategy.
    If so, the misleading (faulty) vote by the traitorous general would be revealed
    and fail to perturb the system as a whole. For the Bitcoin protocol, Nakamoto’s
    key innovation to enable Byzantine fault tolerance was to create a peer-to-peer
    network with a ledger that could record and verify a majority approval, thereby
    revealing any false (traitorous) transactions. This ledger provided a consistent
    means of communication and further allowed for removal of trust from the whole
    system. The ledger is also known as the blockchain, and by attaching blockchain
    to Bitcoin, it became the first digital currency to solve the double spending
    problem network-wide. In the remainder of this chapter, we present a broad overview
    of the broad overview of the technology, and the concept of a blockchain-enabled
    application.The blockchain is primarily a recording ledger that provides all involved
    parties with a secure and synchronized record of transactions from start to finish.
    A blockchain can record hundreds of transactions very rapidly, and has several
    cryptographic measures intrinsic to its design for data security, consistency,
    and validation. Similar transactions on the blockchain are pooled together into
    a functional unit called a block and then sealed with a timestamp (a cryptographic
    fingerprint) that links the current block to the one preceding it. This creates
    an irreversible and tamper-evident string of blocks connected together by timestamps,
    conveniently called a blockchain. The architecture of blockchain is such that
    every transaction is very rapidly verified by all members of the network. Members
    also contain an up-to-date copy of the blockchain locally, which allows for consensus
    to be reached within the decentralized network. Features such as immutable record-keeping
    and network-wide consensus can be integrated into a stack to develop new types
    of applications called decentralized apps (DApps). Let’s look at a prototype of
    a DApp in Figure [1-3](#Fig3), in the context of the Model-View-Controller (MVC
    ) framework.NoteThe first block of the blockchain is called the Genesis block.
    This block is unique in that it does not link to any blocks preceeding it. Nakmoto
    added a bit of historical information to this block as context for the current
    financial environment in the United Kingdom: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor
    on brink of second bailout for banks. “This block not only proves that no bitcoins
    existed before January 3, 2009, but also gives a little insight into the mind
    of the creators.![A430562_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-3.Simple prototype of a decentralized application that interacts with the end
    user at the final stepsThe model and controller here rely on the blockchain for
    data (data integrity and security) and accordingly update the view for the end
    user. The secret sauce in this prototype is the application programming interface
    (API), which works to pull information from the blockchain and provides it to
    the model and controller. This API provides opportunities to extend business logic
    and add it to the blockchain, along with basic operations that take blocks as
    input and provide answers to binary questions. The blockchain could eventually
    have more features, such as oracles that can verify external data and timestamp
    it on the blockchain itself. Once a decentralized app starts dealing with large
    amounts of live data and sophisticated business logic, we can classify it as a
    blockchain-enabled application.'

  zh: 中本聪在创建比特币协议时的真正天才之处在于解决了拜占庭将军问题。该解决方案使用了来自密码朋克社区的组件和思想进行了概括。我们简要讨论了其中三个想法以及它们为完整比特币协议提供的组件：Hashcash用于工作证明，拜占庭容错用于分散网络，以及区块链用于消除对中心化信任或中央机构的需求。让我们深入探讨每一个，从Hashcash开始。Hashcash是由亚当·布莱克在1990年代晚期设计的，旨在通过第一种
    Proof-of-Work（PoW）算法限制电子邮件垃圾邮件。Hashcash背后的理念是为发送电子邮件附加一些计算成本。垃圾邮件发送者的商业模式依赖于发送大量的电子邮件，并且与每个消息关联的成本非常低。然而，如果对每封垃圾邮件发送的成本甚至很小，那么这个成本将会在成千上万封邮件上进行累积，使他们的业务不再有利可图。Hashcash依赖于加密哈希函数的概念：一种哈希函数类型（在比特币的情况下为SHA1）接受一个输入并将其转换为生成消息摘要的字符串，如图[1-2](#Fig2)所示。哈希函数被设计为具有称为单向函数的属性，这意味着可以通过哈希函数轻松验证潜在输入以匹配摘要，但是从摘要重现输入是不可行的。重新创建输入的唯一可能方法是通过使用暴力方法找到适当的输入字符串。在实践中，这是Hashcash以及最终比特币的计算密集型元素。这个原则已经成为推动比特币和大多数加密货币的PoW算法的基础。比特币的PoW更加复杂，并涉及新组件，我们在后面的章节中会详细讨论。![A430562_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)图1-2.加密哈希函数的机制。它接受一个输入并始终将其转换为输出摘要的字符串。我们需要讨论的下一个想法是拜占庭将军问题。这是一组将军之间的一项协议问题，每个将军都指挥一部分拜占庭军队，准备攻击一座城市。这些将军需要制定一个攻击城市的策略并适当地相互沟通。关键在于每个将军都同意一个共同的决定，因为少数将军的不积极攻击比协调的攻击或协调的撤退更糟糕。问题的关键是有些将军是叛徒。他们可能会投票欺骗其他将军，最终导致次优策略。让我们看一个例子：在奇数个将军的情况下，比如七个，三个支持进攻，三个支持撤退。第七位将军可能会向赞成撤退的将军通信，向其他将军通信进攻的协议，导致整个安排崩溃。进攻部队未能夺取城市，因为没有内在的中央机构能够验证所有七名将军之间的信任。在这种情况下，如果所有忠诚的将军能够有效地沟通以达成对他们的策略的无争议的一致意见，那么就可以实现拜占庭容错。如果是这样，叛徒将军的误导性（错误的）投票将被揭示并且无法干扰整个系统。对于比特币协议，中本聪实现拜占庭容错的关键创新是创建一个点对点网络，该网络具有可以记录和验证大多数赞同的账本，从而揭示任何错误（叛徒）交易。这个账本提供了一种一致的通信方式，并进一步允许从整个系统中删除信任。这个账本也被称为区块链，通过将区块链附加到比特币上，它成为了第一个能够在网络范围内解决双花问题的数字货币。在本章的其余部分，我们将介绍区块链技术的广泛概述以及区块链应用程序的概念。区块链主要是一个记录账本，提供从开始到结束的所有相关方的安全和同步的交易记录。区块链可以非常快速地记录数百个交易，并具有几个内置的加密措施，用于数据安全性，一
