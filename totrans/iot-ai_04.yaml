    Dawaliby et al., [2020](#CR20)), and blockchain (Bou Abdo, J., & Zeadally, S.
    ([2020b](#CR9)); Zeadally & Abdo, [2019](#CR58)) are inevitable and a normal advancement
    of the 4th industrial revolution (Rabah, [2018](#CR45)). This technological shift
    presents many controversial ethical and legal issues. Massive unemployment due
    to the replacement of repetitive jobs by faster and more efficient machines has
    political, legal, ethical, and sociological effects that may require governmental
    intervention and policies to regulate the emergence of converged AI, IoT, and
    blockchain (Tang et al., [2019a](#CR50), [b](#CR51)). Supporters of these technologies
    advocate the migration of jobs from repetitive to creative and deny the loss of
    jobs in the long run since converged technologies are a fertile land for new business
    models and thus new businesses.

    to comprehend the scope of emerging converged technologies, since the current
    dilemma is unprecedented. Traditional technology-related dilemmas can be simplified
    into trade-offs such as business vs. ethics or business vs. politics. Thus traditional
    frameworks, such as the utilitarian framework, can be employed to determine the
    best position. In the current dilemma, all the involved factors like business,
    politics, law, ethics, and sociology are on both sides of the comparison. Blockchain,
    for example, creates legal issues (Fang et al., [2018](#CR24)) related to responsibility
    (Tang et al., [2019a](#CR50), [b](#CR51)) and geographic jurisdiction (Allen et
    al., [2019](#CR2)) but solves many pending legal issues such as facilitating online
    dispute resolution (Barnett & Treleaven, [2018](#CR6)) and autonomous implementation
    of contracts using blockchain’s smart contracts (Tang et al., [2019a](#CR50),

    for a good time now. They have contributed to the disruption of life as we know
    it. The three technologies are mainly fueled by data. Their application is not
    limited to a specific field, and they have managed to take part in our daily life.
    Businesses are eager to adopt these technologies since they have new and promising
    sources of revenues. However, they are not yet fully adopted by countries since
    government consent is needed.

    [2017](#CR17)), or simply it is the imitation of human intelligence  in machines
    that are programmed to mimic the thoughts and actions of humans. In fact, one
    of the most interesting aspects of AI is that in applied fields such as, but not
    limited to, Chess, Go, and Poker, the engines are self-taught; they only rely
    on rules to form their own strategies without using the database of human games
    (Silver et al., [2018](#CR46)). Actually, some refer to AI as “the most important
    general-purpose technology of today” (Xu et al., [2018](#CR56)). AI is programmed
    through algorithms to act like humans, yet some main differences persist. While
    humans’ actions are a result of physical observation of the world, AI relies only
    on data without previous knowledge of the existent relationship among this data
    (Corea, [2017](#CR17)).

    at Dartmouth College brainstormed intelligence simulation. Regardless of its current
    success, AI’s age wasn’t always golden. AI went through major setbacks, the first
    one taking place in the late 1960s led to the AI effect, and technology once considered
    AI loses its AI classification and is no longer seen as intelligent. The AI winter,
    a period during which AI funding is minimal, if existent, was another setback
    to AI. It is a recurrent event, and it happened between 1974 and 1980 and between
    1987 and 1993\. In 1987, the DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)
    decided to cut further funding for AI after the personal computers became more
    powerful than the lisp machine, which was the result of extensive years of AI
    research. However, AI winter came to an end in 1993 driven by MIT’s ambition to
    build a humanoid robot, and the new era of AI took on.

    while AI is able to perform routine tasks, some non-routine tasks, the ones that
    require creativity and social intelligence, remain exclusive to humans such as
    client-facing legal work and the design of tailored legal solutions. The authors
    also mentioned that because of AI’s large fixed costs, only large commercial law
    firms and some new entrants with high capital investments can afford it. The researchers
    identified three AI-enabled business models, legal operations, legal technology,
    and consulting, which offer low-cost and scaled services, price based on output
    rather than input. However, the three models rely greatly on human capital teams
    with multidisciplinary capacities, external capital, and organizational governance.
    In addition, the various models require complements from the traditional legal
    advisory business model especially for bespoke legal work (Metelskaia et al.,

    for which traditional firm-centric business models  aren’t applicable (Dijkman

    with competitors and across industries in ways that are not currently supported
    by traditional business models. In addition, technology-related industries  are
    characterized by fast-changing environments in which companies must be able to
    adjust and adapt rapidly in order to succeed (Chan, [2015](#CR15)). In fact, innovation
    is not the only requirement in the IoT industry (Hussain, [2017](#CR30)). Innovative
    business models  are required and considered as a source of competitive advantage
    (Chan, [2015](#CR15); Hussain, [2017](#CR30)). Detecting malicious URLs uses binary

    challenge to note is that development of IoT applications will necessarily emerge

    in IoT business models is the value proposition. They also consider customer relationships
    and key partnerships to be essential building blocks of IoT business models. In
    their BMC, value proposition is characterized by, among others, newness, cost
    reduction, accessibility, performance, customization, and convenience. Meanwhile,
    a variety of customer relationships are proposed, including personal assistance,
    self-service, automated service, and co-creation. Key partnerships consist of
    hardware producers, software developers, data interpretation, launching customers,
    logistics, and others. It is important to note that software, hardware, and data
    processing are among the foundational IoT technologies (Lee & Lee, [2015](#CR35))
    which justify the choice of key partners. Objects rely on software to communicate
    and function effectively, while hardware innovation and its miniaturization lead
    the evolution in some industries with improved energy efficiency (Lee & Lee, [2015](#CR35)).

    better forecasting ability, process optimization, and customer service experiences.
    Therefore, the use of network-centered service-dominant business models for IoT
    is more appropriate than traditional, firm-centric ones (Chan, [2015](#CR15)).
    Under the service-dominant model  , individual firms should act as organizers
    of value creation in the value creation networks created by collaborating with
    market partners and customers. Moreover, smart collaborations are the key to IoT
    success and a source of competitiveness for firms. Therefore, most firms unwilling

- en: Blockchain technology  emerged in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin,
    and it is the reason why people mistakenly presume that blockchain is limited
    to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin is only one application of blockchain
    technology. In fact, blockchain is more than that, and while some consider it
    an information and communications technology (ICT) revolution, others argue that
    it is more like a general-purpose technology or even an institutional one.

    late twentieth century. Yet, they have remained centralized until blockchain was
    invented. This is why blockchain could be considered a revolution of bookkeeping
    given its characteristics as a decentralized and distributed public ledger. Centralized
    technologies are expensive and have problems in relation to trust abuse, while
    blockchain offers a decentralized and trustless solution in which no third-party
    verification is required, but instead a consensus mechanism (Bou Abdo et al.,
    [2020](#CR10)) and a cryptographic proof are used to verify transactions added
    to the ledger. Moreover, blockchain is able to overcome some limitations of centralized
    ledgers where only one person is authorized to keep record and where the stored
    data is not portable (Abadi & Brunnermeier, [2018](#CR1)).
  prefs: []

- en: Blockchain  is considered a revolution to the ICT since it represents a new
    technology for public databases. However, it is also seen as a general-purpose
    technology due to its “ability to track transaction attributes, settle trades
    and enforce contracts across a wide variety of digital assets” (Catalini & Gans,
    [2016](#CR12)). Others characterize blockchain as an institutional technology
    whose applications tend to interact with the current regulatory frameworks (Berg
    et al., [2018](#CR7)).

    solved the double-spending problem that was hindering the creation of any peer-to-peer
    electronic cash system (Davidson et al., [2016](#CR18)). It is important to note
    that the value of blockchain is independent from that of the Bitcoin that are
    generated through mining. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus (Catalini
    & Gans, [2016](#CR12)) based on consensus mechanism in which miners solve cryptographic
    problems to validate blocks and add them to the chain. Bitcoin isn’t risk-free,
    and because it uses a permissionless blockchain model, it could be vulnerable
    to a majority attack (a.k.a. 51% attack) which happens when a group of miners
    controls 51% of the mining power (Budish, [2018](#CR11)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless  of the risk it entails, many prefer the use of Bitcoin over fiat
    currency due to the privileges it offers. While executing a transaction using
    Bitcoin, the user’s identity remains anonymous, payments, whether local or international,
    are nearly instant and with negligible fees in comparison to traditional payment
    methods that involve a third party (e.g., banks).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what is the difference between permissioned and permissionless blockchains?
    In a permissioned blockchain, recordkeeping is only performed by known agents
    rather than anonymous agents/miners, and it is why there is no need to perform
    proof of work (Abadi & Brunnermeier, [2018](#CR1); Catalini & Gans, [2016](#CR12)),
    and therefore there is no reward (like it is the case in Bitcoin which uses permissionless
    blockchain and rewards miners to incentivize them).

    contracts or computer programs stored inside the blockchain and are autonomously
    executed once the contract terms are reached. So blockchain is “a technology for
    creating and executing the types of rule-systems (i.e., smart contracts, DAOs)
    that enable bespoke socio-economic coordination” (Davidson et al., [2016](#CR18)).

    [2015](#CR38)) that are used to record public transactions electronically without
    the need of a central ownership. According to the findings of a research consortium
    InterChainZ project (undertaken by EY), incorporating a trusted third party would
    have a potential in several financial services such as KYC (know your customer),
    AML (anti-money laundering), and insurance (Mainelli & Smith, [2015](#CR38)).
    In fact, adding a trusted third party to execute the validation role would replace
    the expensive mining needed to validate the nodes. It is interesting to note that
    mining’s cost is not limited to the reward (Bitcoins) but also entails the energy/electricity
    power needed which is considered a disadvantage.

    many levels. In fact, there are numerous applications for distributed ledgers
    that governments can use. However, governments’ actions on regulatory, legislative,
    and investment levels play a key role in the adoption and development of blockchain
    technology (Catalini & Gans, [2016](#CR12)). Some governments are already supporting
    and developing blockchain technology, while others remain a hostile environment
    for its development and adoption. In addition, while some geographic regions develop
    blockchain, these same regions/governments might not adopt the new technology
    because of some complexities such as regulatory ones and therefore “the geography
    of invention is not the same as the geography of innovation” (Berg et al., [2018](#CR7)).

    ownership, implement it to their tax systems, use it for voting and for central
    bank digital currency, etc. As it is the case with any other technology, before
    adoption, governments should evaluate the efficacy and social welfare of the transition
    to the new technology, making sure that the marginal benefit outweighs marginal
    cost. Another constraint to adoption of blockchain by governments is the trust
    in the government itself, which varies from one country to another. Finally, some
    governments lack the capability to implement crypto-economy infrastructure and
    create the needed governance on a regulatory level (Berg et al., [2018](#CR7)).

    privacy and its handling methods (Tang et al., [2019a](#CR50), [b](#CR51)), its

    describing the records created by blockchain technology as immutable” (Walch,
    [2016](#CR54)). This empowers blockchain to be considered as digital evidence
    in the courtroom. Blockchain’s immutability is maintained if, and only if, the
    network of miners has never been breached, but this cannot be ensured (Walch,
    [2016](#CR54)) especially in the case of permissioned blockchains. Blockchain’s
    immutability, as an evidence, and GDPR are conflicting since the second requires
    the blockchain to be modifiable as shown in (Farshid et al., [2019](#CR25); Gabison,
    [2016](#CR27)).

    out-of-court nature which subjects it to hearsay scrutiny and possibly “confrontation
    clause” analysis (Guo, [2016](#CR28)) similar to what happened in the United States
    v. Lizarraga-Tirado case (United States v. Lizarraga-Tirado). Blockchain in its
    current design is facing many criticisms against being utilized as digital evidence.
    Scientists, on the other hand, are working on court-friendly blockchain functions
    that offer strong non-repudiation characteristics (Zarpala & Casino, [2020](#CR57)).

    assets such as buildings (Li et al., [2018](#CR37)). Its speed, cost, and double-entry
    bookkeeping make it an excellent solution for “proof of ownership” in business
    transactions even if not fully considered as authoritative in the courtroom. The
    widespread use of these systems and the increasing pace of international business
    will force the regulators to adopt blockchain as evidence especially in cross-jurisdiction

    transactions, such as in the case of a credit card payment at a hotel; it is safe
    to assume that the client had an agreement with the hotel for a legitimate service
    provided by the hotel. It is still debatable whether cryptocurrency transactions
    have the same power in proving intentions and service expectations and as evidence
    for contract existence (Kiviat, [2015](#CR33)). The real debate lies in the nature
    of cryptocurrencies themselves, whether they are real currencies and should abide
    by monetary regulations or financial instruments similar to stocks and bonds and
    should be regulated by respective regulations.

    through, but this does not safeguard the technology from being brought into trial
    in case of intentional and unintentional negative consequences (Doshi-Velez et
    al., [2017](#CR23)). AI is lightly regulated but is capable of doing immense damages.
    For this reason, legitimate concerns are raised on AI’s suitability in automatic
    decision systems (Doshi-Velez et al., [2017](#CR23)). The essential concern on
    AI is failing to comprehend how a specific decision has been made and thus who
    should be held accountable. AI’s decision logic may be a black box, or it can
    be transparent. But even when the algorithm is transparent, it is not necessarily
    comprehendible; thus explanation, human-interpretable information about the decision-making
    factors, and their importance are required by the legislators. Additionally, the
    AI system should be able to respond to alternative scenarios posed in the courtroom
    to identify the suitability of the intelligent system and to define accountability.

    and concerns about adopting them, in addition to the hype surrounding their market
    penetration. AI, IoT, and blockchain are not different from other disruptive technologies
    such as cloud computing, fog computing, and 5G. In this chapter, we tried to look
    at AI, IoT, and blockchain from an objective perspective listing their business
    potential and newly created business models but also some of the dilemmas they
    introduce on the ethical and legal levels. The full adoption of these three technologies
    in their standalone formats and converged formats depends on the researchers’
    ability to tackle the challenges and decrease their impact. Additionally, new
    business models and adoption increases will push legislators to develop non-optimal
    regulations, in an attempt to regulate the market’s unstable situation.
