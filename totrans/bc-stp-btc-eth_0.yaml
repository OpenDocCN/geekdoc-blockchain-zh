- en: 'IntroductionOnce a software developer asked me about the possibilities of Bitcoin.
    I explained it like this:Me: ‘Have you done work for clients as a freelancer?’Developer:
    ‘Yes.’Me: ‘Then you are familiar with the challenges that come with independent
    contract work; you have to make deals such as getting 50% payment upfront and
    50% after completion of the project. Or you have to use an escrow service. You
    need contracts, and you and the client take on risk. Sometimes it gets messy,
    and you could have conflicts about payment.’He nods quickly; he knows how things
    go. I continue: ‘People are currently working on technology that works on top
    of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that solves this, and many other things.
    For example, you could define a smart contract that pays according to your project’s
    timeline. Say that you and the client expect it to take two months to complete
    and that the price is fixed. The smart contract starts the money stream from the
    client to the contractor, minute by minute, until the end date. If someone is
    not happy at any point, either you or them clicks the button, and the stream of
    money stops. This guarantee is unstoppable and does not require an escrow agent.’The
    developer understands it, because he says: ‘I’m going to work on this as soon
    as I get home.’Such moments of entrepreneurial inspiration are typical for people
    who study the details of cryptocurrency.This book aims to help entrepreneurs make
    sense of the opportunities offered by cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. The
    launch of Bitcoin opened the field of finance for disruptive innovation: new products
    and services are possible, built by up-and-coming players such as startups and
    open source projects. In the age of crony-capitalism, which abuses its political
    power to earn money without risk, a handful of companies control finance. Other
    problems include fraud, quantitative easing, and too much debt. That is why innovation
    in the financial sector is an exciting trend. The invention of Bitcoin and decentralized
    finance means that you, yes you , can dive into the field of financial technology
    and stake a claim on the profits of banks. You can start solving problems that
    legacy players are ignoring.The big-sounding phrase “global financial sector”
    suggests that a scrappy entrepreneur like yourself should stay away from it. Any
    financial product, such as an insurance policy, mortgage, or investment, involves
    the creation and transfer of money, which are critical functions in the economy.
    That is why the “global financial sector” runs on top of banks. We can even be
    more specific: It is an oligopoly of institutions that controls money and investing
    (Andreas M. Antonopoulos, The internet of Money , 2016). Economics 101 says that
    an oligopoly is a group of large companies within an industry who agree to keep
    prices high and competition at bay. Big banks work together to achieve a de facto
    monopoly on financial services. The cronies fear startup companies that compete
    with them on a level playing field. Your challenge as a crypto entrepreneur is
    to bypass and undercut these banks by giving their current customers a better
    financial product or service. You can win by inventing value propositions that
    outclass those offered by banks.This book is for doers and builders. I will focus
    on your opportunities as an entrepreneur. That is why we will skip cryptographic
    math, computer science, economic models, or game theory. Of course, these topics
    do matter: they are part of your arsenal as an entrepreneur, and it is to your
    advantage to learn as much about them as you can. But these topics have already
    been covered in other books, which I will mention in this book. Whenever I reference
    a book about cryptocurrency and related issues, it means that I recommend it with
    enthusiasm.The history of technology has shown how disruptions play out. Innovators
    build a scrappy application or platform that grows from obscurity, powered by
    a new perspective on an existing product. They get rapid feedback from their initial
    user base, taking advantage of their greater adaptability as a small organization
    until they boost the user experience beyond those of the legacy players. This
    process causes drama. Every technology that makes our life more efficient replaces
    companies that served that market less efficiently. For example, the invention
    of clay roof tiles put artisans of thatched roofs out of work, and the mainstream
    adoption of cars turned horse-drawn carts and carriages into quaint antiques.
    Likewise, Xerox machines and personal computers replaced armies of secretaries.
    We often see that technological progress gives a boost to the quality of life
    of the many at the cost of a forced career change for the few. Recent examples
    relevant for software entrepreneurs include brick-and-mortar retailers who lost
    their business to e-commerce platforms. It is easy to see how we all benefit from
    progress. If you have lived through any of the above examples, you know that feeling
    you get as a customer: “Wow! This is so much better! From now on, I want this
    new thing.” Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets can be like that. Entrepreneurs
    can use blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to disrupt banks, who are the
    legacy players of finance. Cryptocurrencies put the control over money back into
    the hands of the public.Economic progress depends on entrepreneurs applying technology
    to people’s problems, and most of us have plenty of financial challenges. Society,
    as a whole, has large-scale money problems that remain unsolved. A startup can
    tackle any one of these problems, which we will discuss one by one. By dividing
    and conquering, we can transcend the widespread economic and political challenges
    related to money and finance. Entrepreneurs have a heroic role to play; taking
    honorable risks to get rewarded for mastering these challenges. Cryptocurrencies
    are the tools to get it done.The inventors of Bitcoin and Ethereum designed them
    for smooth financial transactions. In contrast, banks have an outdated infrastructure
    with friction and hidden risk in most transactions. The entrepreneurs who drill
    into these challenges have an excellent chance to succeed with one venture or
    another. Their strategy is simple: 1) look at financial functions that make customers
    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts
    as an immutable ledger of transactions. International transfers of a cryptocurrency
    are already superior to the services of any bank or other financial institution.
    You do not even need to have an account anywhere. Furthermore, software entrepreneurs
    and finance wizards can build services that use this money without having to partner
    with a bank. Chapters 4 and 5 explore some financial solutions that don’t rely
    on the legacy banking system. Chapter 6 gives examples of successful tokenized
    assets.As I write this in 2020, only a small portion of the global population
    wants cryptocurrency. However, when Bitcoin and Ethereum work as intended, traditional
    financial products will become obsolete. In the future, other blockchain-based
    systems could become relevant as well. Where a public blockchain can replace intermediaries,
    transactions get faster while costs fall. For now, the use cases are limited to
    international payments, some illegal trades, unstoppable donations, and protection
    from inflation. We are still figuring out how to apply this technology to other
    commercial uses.From the broad adoption of paper currency until the invention
    of Bitcoin, the business of creating currency belonged to banks. They profit from
    low interest rates on loans from the central bank, they create new money, and
    they get exclusive access to the best investment opportunities. In their comfortable
    status quo, banks capture most of the value of their captive customer base. However,
    since the launch of Bitcoin, the power of banks is up for liquidation. Nowadays,
    entrepreneurs can compete for customers by using blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. A superior class of value propositions is now possible. We can enter
    existing but closed markets and discover new ones, for example, serving people
    who do not have bank accounts, the so-called “unbanked,” or explore new business
    models for selling digital content. We can develop products that benefit from
    the shared efforts behind open-source software. The entrepreneurs and their customers
    take the power from banks by transacting on a new network that holds cryptographically
    secured assets.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.

    with them on a level playing field. Your challenge as a crypto entrepreneur is
    to bypass and undercut these banks by giving their current customers a better
    financial product or service. You can win by inventing value propositions that
    outclass those offered by banks.This book is for doers and builders. I will focus
    on your opportunities as an entrepreneur. That is why we will skip cryptographic
    math, computer science, economic models, or game theory. Of course, these topics
    do matter: they are part of your arsenal as an entrepreneur, and it is to your
    advantage to learn as much about them as you can. But these topics have already
    been covered in other books, which I will mention in this book. Whenever I reference
    a book about cryptocurrency and related issues, it means that I recommend it with
    enthusiasm.The history of technology has shown how disruptions play out. Innovators
    build a scrappy application or platform that grows from obscurity, powered by
    a new perspective on an existing product. They get rapid feedback from their initial
    user base, taking advantage of their greater adaptability as a small organization
    until they boost the user experience beyond those of the legacy players. This
    process causes drama. Every technology that makes our life more efficient replaces
    companies that served that market less efficiently. For example, the invention
    of clay roof tiles put artisans of thatched roofs out of work, and the mainstream
    adoption of cars turned horse-drawn carts and carriages into quaint antiques.
    Likewise, Xerox machines and personal computers replaced armies of secretaries.
    We often see that technological progress gives a boost to the quality of life
    of the many at the cost of a forced career change for the few. Recent examples
    relevant for software entrepreneurs include brick-and-mortar retailers who lost
    their business to e-commerce platforms. It is easy to see how we all benefit from
    progress. If you have lived through any of the above examples, you know that feeling
    you get as a customer: “Wow! This is so much better! From now on, I want this
    new thing.” Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets can be like that. Entrepreneurs
    can use blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to disrupt banks, who are the
    legacy players of finance. Cryptocurrencies put the control over money back into
    the hands of the public.Economic progress depends on entrepreneurs applying technology
    to people’s problems, and most of us have plenty of financial challenges. Society,
    as a whole, has large-scale money problems that remain unsolved. A startup can
    tackle any one of these problems, which we will discuss one by one. By dividing
    and conquering, we can transcend the widespread economic and political challenges
    related to money and finance. Entrepreneurs have a heroic role to play; taking
    honorable risks to get rewarded for mastering these challenges. Cryptocurrencies
    are the tools to get it done.The inventors of Bitcoin and Ethereum designed them
    for smooth financial transactions. In contrast, banks have an outdated infrastructure
    with friction and hidden risk in most transactions. The entrepreneurs who drill
    into these challenges have an excellent chance to succeed with one venture or
    another. Their strategy is simple: 1) look at financial functions that make customers
    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts
    as an immutable ledger of transactions. International transfers of a cryptocurrency
    are already superior to the services of any bank or other financial institution.
    You do not even need to have an account anywhere. Furthermore, software entrepreneurs
    and finance wizards can build services that use this money without having to partner
    with a bank. Chapters 4 and 5 explore some financial solutions that don’t rely
    on the legacy banking system. Chapter 6 gives examples of successful tokenized
    assets.As I write this in 2020, only a small portion of the global population
    wants cryptocurrency. However, when Bitcoin and Ethereum work as intended, traditional
    financial products will become obsolete. In the future, other blockchain-based
    systems could become relevant as well. Where a public blockchain can replace intermediaries,
    transactions get faster while costs fall. For now, the use cases are limited to
    international payments, some illegal trades, unstoppable donations, and protection
    from inflation. We are still figuring out how to apply this technology to other
    commercial uses.From the broad adoption of paper currency until the invention
    of Bitcoin, the business of creating currency belonged to banks. They profit from
    low interest rates on loans from the central bank, they create new money, and
    they get exclusive access to the best investment opportunities. In their comfortable
    status quo, banks capture most of the value of their captive customer base. However,
    since the launch of Bitcoin, the power of banks is up for liquidation. Nowadays,
    entrepreneurs can compete for customers by using blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. A superior class of value propositions is now possible. We can enter
    existing but closed markets and discover new ones, for example, serving people
    who do not have bank accounts, the so-called “unbanked,” or explore new business
    models for selling digital content. We can develop products that benefit from
    the shared efforts behind open-source software. The entrepreneurs and their customers
    take the power from banks by transacting on a new network that holds cryptographically
    secured assets.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.
    Enjoy the journey.Developer: ‘Yes.’Me: ‘Then you are familiar with the challenges
    that come with independent contract work; you have to make deals such as getting
    50% payment upfront and 50% after completion of the project. Or you have to use
    an escrow service. You need contracts, and you and the client take on risk. Sometimes
    it gets messy, and you could have conflicts about payment.’He nods quickly; he
    knows how things go. I continue: ‘People are currently working on technology that
    works on top of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that solves this, and many
    other things. For example, you could define a smart contract that pays according
    to your project’s timeline. Say that you and the client expect it to take two
    months to complete and that the price is fixed. The smart contract starts the
    money stream from the client to the contractor, minute by minute, until the end
    date. If someone is not happy at any point, either you or them clicks the button,
    and the stream of money stops. This guarantee is unstoppable and does not require
    an escrow agent.’The developer understands it, because he says: ‘I’m going to
    work on this as soon as I get home.’Such moments of entrepreneurial inspiration
    are typical for people who study the details of cryptocurrency.This book aims
    to help entrepreneurs make sense of the opportunities offered by cryptocurrencies
    and digital tokens. The launch of Bitcoin opened the field of finance for disruptive
    innovation: new products and services are possible, built by up-and-coming players
    such as startups and open source projects. In the age of crony-capitalism, which
    abuses its political power to earn money without risk, a handful of companies
    control finance. Other problems include fraud, quantitative easing, and too much
    debt. That is why innovation in the financial sector is an exciting trend. The
    invention of Bitcoin and decentralized finance means that you, yes you , can dive
    into the field of financial technology and stake a claim on the profits of banks.
    You can start solving problems that legacy players are ignoring.The big-sounding
    phrase “global financial sector” suggests that a scrappy entrepreneur like yourself
    should stay away from it. Any financial product, such as an insurance policy,
    mortgage, or investment, involves the creation and transfer of money, which are
    critical functions in the economy. That is why the “global financial sector” runs
    on top of banks. We can even be more specific: It is an oligopoly of institutions
    that controls money and investing (Andreas M. Antonopoulos, The internet of Money
    , 2016). Economics 101 says that an oligopoly is a group of large companies within
    an industry who agree to keep prices high and competition at bay. Big banks work
    together to achieve a de facto monopoly on financial services. The cronies fear
    startup companies that compete with them on a level playing field. Your challenge
    as a crypto entrepreneur is to bypass and undercut these banks by giving their
    current customers a better financial product or service. You can win by inventing

    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts
    as an immutable ledger of transactions. International transfers of a cryptocurrency
    are already superior to the services of any bank or other financial institution.
    You do not even need to have an account anywhere. Furthermore, software entrepreneurs
    and finance wizards can build services that use this money without having to partner
    with a bank. Chapters 4 and 5 explore some financial solutions that don’t rely
    on the legacy banking system. Chapter 6 gives examples of successful tokenized
    assets.As I write this in 2020, only a small portion of the global population
    wants cryptocurrency. However, when Bitcoin and Ethereum work as intended, traditional
    financial products will become obsolete. In the future, other blockchain-based
    systems could become relevant as well. Where a public blockchain can replace intermediaries,
    transactions get faster while costs fall. For now, the use cases are limited to
    international payments, some illegal trades, unstoppable donations, and protection
    from inflation. We are still figuring out how to apply this technology to other
    commercial uses.From the broad adoption of paper currency until the invention
    of Bitcoin, the business of creating currency belonged to banks. They profit from
    low interest rates on loans from the central bank, they create new money, and
    they get exclusive access to the best investment opportunities. In their comfortable
    status quo, banks capture most of the value of their captive customer base. However,
    since the launch of Bitcoin, the power of banks is up for liquidation. Nowadays,
    entrepreneurs can compete for customers by using blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. A superior class of value propositions is now possible. We can enter
    existing but closed markets and discover new ones, for example, serving people
    who do not have bank accounts, the so-called “unbanked,” or explore new business
    models for selling digital content. We can develop products that benefit from
    the shared efforts behind open-source software. The entrepreneurs and their customers
    take the power from banks by transacting on a new network that holds cryptographically
    secured assets.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.
    Enjoy the journey.He nods quickly; he knows how things go. I continue: ‘People
    are currently working on technology that works on top of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    that solves this, and many other things. For example, you could define a smart
    contract that pays according to your project’s timeline. Say that you and the
    client expect it to take two months to complete and that the price is fixed. The
    smart contract starts the money stream from the client to the contractor, minute
    by minute, until the end date. If someone is not happy at any point, either you
    or them clicks the button, and the stream of money stops. This guarantee is unstoppable
    and does not require an escrow agent.’The developer understands it, because he
    says: ‘I’m going to work on this as soon as I get home.’Such moments of entrepreneurial
    inspiration are typical for people who study the details of cryptocurrency.This
    book aims to help entrepreneurs make sense of the opportunities offered by cryptocurrencies
    and digital tokens. The launch of Bitcoin opened the field of finance for disruptive
    innovation: new products and services are possible, built by up-and-coming players
    such as startups and open source projects. In the age of crony-capitalism, which
    abuses its political power to earn money without risk, a handful of companies
    control finance. Other problems include fraud, quantitative easing, and too much
    debt. That is why innovation in the financial sector is an exciting trend. The
    invention of Bitcoin and decentralized finance means that you, yes you , can dive
    into the field of financial technology and stake a claim on the profits of banks.
    You can start solving problems that legacy players are ignoring.The big-sounding
    phrase “global financial sector” suggests that a scrappy entrepreneur like yourself
    should stay away from it. Any financial product, such as an insurance policy,
    mortgage, or investment, involves the creation and transfer of money, which are
    critical functions in the economy. That is why the “global financial sector” runs
    on top of banks. We can even be more specific: It is an oligopoly of institutions
    that controls money and investing (Andreas M. Antonopoulos, The internet of Money
    , 2016). Economics 101 says that an oligopoly is a group of large companies within
    an industry who agree to keep prices high and competition at bay. Big banks work
    together to achieve a de facto monopoly on financial services. The cronies fear
    startup companies that compete with them on a level playing field. Your challenge
    as a crypto entrepreneur is to bypass and undercut these banks by giving their
    current customers a better financial product or service. You can win by inventing
    value propositions that outclass those offered by banks.This book is for doers
    and builders. I will focus on your opportunities as an entrepreneur. That is why
    we will skip cryptographic math, computer science, economic models, or game theory.
    Of course, these topics do matter: they are part of your arsenal as an entrepreneur,
    and it is to your advantage to learn as much about them as you can. But these
    topics have already been covered in other books, which I will mention in this
    book. Whenever I reference a book about cryptocurrency and related issues, it
    means that I recommend it with enthusiasm.The history of technology has shown
    how disruptions play out. Innovators build a scrappy application or platform that
    grows from obscurity, powered by a new perspective on an existing product. They
    get rapid feedback from their initial user base, taking advantage of their greater
    adaptability as a small organization until they boost the user experience beyond
    those of the legacy players. This process causes drama. Every technology that
    makes our life more efficient replaces companies that served that market less
    efficiently. For example, the invention of clay roof tiles put artisans of thatched
    roofs out of work, and the mainstream adoption of cars turned horse-drawn carts
    and carriages into quaint antiques. Likewise, Xerox machines and personal computers
    replaced armies of secretaries. We often see that technological progress gives
    a boost to the quality of life of the many at the cost of a forced career change
    for the few. Recent examples relevant for software entrepreneurs include brick-and-mortar
    retailers who lost their business to e-commerce platforms. It is easy to see how
    we all benefit from progress. If you have lived through any of the above examples,
    you know that feeling you get as a customer: “Wow! This is so much better! From
    now on, I want this new thing.” Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets can be
    like that. Entrepreneurs can use blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to disrupt
    banks, who are the legacy players of finance. Cryptocurrencies put the control
    over money back into the hands of the public.Economic progress depends on entrepreneurs
    applying technology to people’s problems, and most of us have plenty of financial
    challenges. Society, as a whole, has large-scale money problems that remain unsolved.
    A startup can tackle any one of these problems, which we will discuss one by one.
    By dividing and conquering, we can transcend the widespread economic and political
    challenges related to money and finance. Entrepreneurs have a heroic role to play;
    taking honorable risks to get rewarded for mastering these challenges. Cryptocurrencies
    are the tools to get it done.The inventors of Bitcoin and Ethereum designed them
    for smooth financial transactions. In contrast, banks have an outdated infrastructure
    with friction and hidden risk in most transactions. The entrepreneurs who drill
    into these challenges have an excellent chance to succeed with one venture or
    another. Their strategy is simple: 1) look at financial functions that make customers
    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts

    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.
    Enjoy the journey.Such moments of entrepreneurial inspiration are typical for
    people who study the details of cryptocurrency.This book aims to help entrepreneurs
    make sense of the opportunities offered by cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.
    The launch of Bitcoin opened the field of finance for disruptive innovation: new
    products and services are possible, built by up-and-coming players such as startups
    and open source projects. In the age of crony-capitalism, which abuses its political
    power to earn money without risk, a handful of companies control finance. Other
    problems include fraud, quantitative easing, and too much debt. That is why innovation
    in the financial sector is an exciting trend. The invention of Bitcoin and decentralized
    finance means that you, yes you , can dive into the field of financial technology
    and stake a claim on the profits of banks. You can start solving problems that
    legacy players are ignoring.The big-sounding phrase “global financial sector”
    suggests that a scrappy entrepreneur like yourself should stay away from it. Any
    financial product, such as an insurance policy, mortgage, or investment, involves
    the creation and transfer of money, which are critical functions in the economy.
    That is why the “global financial sector” runs on top of banks. We can even be
    more specific: It is an oligopoly of institutions that controls money and investing
    (Andreas M. Antonopoulos, The internet of Money , 2016). Economics 101 says that
    an oligopoly is a group of large companies within an industry who agree to keep
    prices high and competition at bay. Big banks work together to achieve a de facto
    monopoly on financial services. The cronies fear startup companies that compete
    with them on a level playing field. Your challenge as a crypto entrepreneur is
    to bypass and undercut these banks by giving their current customers a better
    financial product or service. You can win by inventing value propositions that
    outclass those offered by banks.This book is for doers and builders. I will focus
    on your opportunities as an entrepreneur. That is why we will skip cryptographic
    math, computer science, economic models, or game theory. Of course, these topics
    do matter: they are part of your arsenal as an entrepreneur, and it is to your
    advantage to learn as much about them as you can. But these topics have already
    been covered in other books, which I will mention in this book. Whenever I reference
    a book about cryptocurrency and related issues, it means that I recommend it with
    enthusiasm.The history of technology has shown how disruptions play out. Innovators
    build a scrappy application or platform that grows from obscurity, powered by
    a new perspective on an existing product. They get rapid feedback from their initial
    user base, taking advantage of their greater adaptability as a small organization
    until they boost the user experience beyond those of the legacy players. This
    process causes drama. Every technology that makes our life more efficient replaces
    companies that served that market less efficiently. For example, the invention
    of clay roof tiles put artisans of thatched roofs out of work, and the mainstream
    adoption of cars turned horse-drawn carts and carriages into quaint antiques.
    Likewise, Xerox machines and personal computers replaced armies of secretaries.
    We often see that technological progress gives a boost to the quality of life
    of the many at the cost of a forced career change for the few. Recent examples
    relevant for software entrepreneurs include brick-and-mortar retailers who lost
    their business to e-commerce platforms. It is easy to see how we all benefit from
    progress. If you have lived through any of the above examples, you know that feeling
    you get as a customer: “Wow! This is so much better! From now on, I want this
    new thing.” Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets can be like that. Entrepreneurs
    can use blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to disrupt banks, who are the
    legacy players of finance. Cryptocurrencies put the control over money back into
    the hands of the public.Economic progress depends on entrepreneurs applying technology
    to people’s problems, and most of us have plenty of financial challenges. Society,
    as a whole, has large-scale money problems that remain unsolved. A startup can
    tackle any one of these problems, which we will discuss one by one. By dividing
    and conquering, we can transcend the widespread economic and political challenges
    related to money and finance. Entrepreneurs have a heroic role to play; taking
    honorable risks to get rewarded for mastering these challenges. Cryptocurrencies
    are the tools to get it done.The inventors of Bitcoin and Ethereum designed them
    for smooth financial transactions. In contrast, banks have an outdated infrastructure
    with friction and hidden risk in most transactions. The entrepreneurs who drill
    into these challenges have an excellent chance to succeed with one venture or
    another. Their strategy is simple: 1) look at financial functions that make customers
    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts
    as an immutable ledger of transactions. International transfers of a cryptocurrency
    are already superior to the services of any bank or other financial institution.
    You do not even need to have an account anywhere. Furthermore, software entrepreneurs
    and finance wizards can build services that use this money without having to partner
    with a bank. Chapters 4 and 5 explore some financial solutions that don’t rely
    on the legacy banking system. Chapter 6 gives examples of successful tokenized
    assets.As I write this in 2020, only a small portion of the global population
    wants cryptocurrency. However, when Bitcoin and Ethereum work as intended, traditional
    financial products will become obsolete. In the future, other blockchain-based
    systems could become relevant as well. Where a public blockchain can replace intermediaries,
    transactions get faster while costs fall. For now, the use cases are limited to
    international payments, some illegal trades, unstoppable donations, and protection
    from inflation. We are still figuring out how to apply this technology to other
    commercial uses.From the broad adoption of paper currency until the invention
    of Bitcoin, the business of creating currency belonged to banks. They profit from
    low interest rates on loans from the central bank, they create new money, and
    they get exclusive access to the best investment opportunities. In their comfortable
    status quo, banks capture most of the value of their captive customer base. However,
    since the launch of Bitcoin, the power of banks is up for liquidation. Nowadays,
    entrepreneurs can compete for customers by using blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. A superior class of value propositions is now possible. We can enter
    existing but closed markets and discover new ones, for example, serving people
    who do not have bank accounts, the so-called “unbanked,” or explore new business
    models for selling digital content. We can develop products that benefit from
    the shared efforts behind open-source software. The entrepreneurs and their customers
    take the power from banks by transacting on a new network that holds cryptographically
    secured assets.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited

    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond

    of cars turned horse-drawn carts and carriages into quaint antiques. Likewise,
    Xerox machines and personal computers replaced armies of secretaries. We often
    see that technological progress gives a boost to the quality of life of the many
    at the cost of a forced career change for the few. Recent examples relevant for
    software entrepreneurs include brick-and-mortar retailers who lost their business
    to e-commerce platforms. It is easy to see how we all benefit from progress. If
    you have lived through any of the above examples, you know that feeling you get
    as a customer: “Wow! This is so much better! From now on, I want this new thing.”
    Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets can be like that. Entrepreneurs can use
    blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to disrupt banks, who are the legacy
    players of finance. Cryptocurrencies put the control over money back into the
    hands of the public.Economic progress depends on entrepreneurs applying technology
    to people’s problems, and most of us have plenty of financial challenges. Society,
    as a whole, has large-scale money problems that remain unsolved. A startup can
    tackle any one of these problems, which we will discuss one by one. By dividing
    and conquering, we can transcend the widespread economic and political challenges
    related to money and finance. Entrepreneurs have a heroic role to play; taking
    honorable risks to get rewarded for mastering these challenges. Cryptocurrencies
    are the tools to get it done.The inventors of Bitcoin and Ethereum designed them
    for smooth financial transactions. In contrast, banks have an outdated infrastructure
    with friction and hidden risk in most transactions. The entrepreneurs who drill
    into these challenges have an excellent chance to succeed with one venture or
    another. Their strategy is simple: 1) look at financial functions that make customers
    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts
    as an immutable ledger of transactions. International transfers of a cryptocurrency
    are already superior to the services of any bank or other financial institution.
    You do not even need to have an account anywhere. Furthermore, software entrepreneurs
    and finance wizards can build services that use this money without having to partner
    with a bank. Chapters 4 and 5 explore some financial solutions that don’t rely
    on the legacy banking system. Chapter 6 gives examples of successful tokenized
    assets.As I write this in 2020, only a small portion of the global population
    wants cryptocurrency. However, when Bitcoin and Ethereum work as intended, traditional
    financial products will become obsolete. In the future, other blockchain-based
    systems could become relevant as well. Where a public blockchain can replace intermediaries,
    transactions get faster while costs fall. For now, the use cases are limited to
    international payments, some illegal trades, unstoppable donations, and protection
    from inflation. We are still figuring out how to apply this technology to other
    commercial uses.From the broad adoption of paper currency until the invention
    of Bitcoin, the business of creating currency belonged to banks. They profit from
    low interest rates on loans from the central bank, they create new money, and
    they get exclusive access to the best investment opportunities. In their comfortable
    status quo, banks capture most of the value of their captive customer base. However,
    since the launch of Bitcoin, the power of banks is up for liquidation. Nowadays,
    entrepreneurs can compete for customers by using blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. A superior class of value propositions is now possible. We can enter
    existing but closed markets and discover new ones, for example, serving people
    who do not have bank accounts, the so-called “unbanked,” or explore new business
    models for selling digital content. We can develop products that benefit from
    the shared efforts behind open-source software. The entrepreneurs and their customers
    take the power from banks by transacting on a new network that holds cryptographically
    secured assets.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.
    Enjoy the journey.This book is for doers and builders. I will focus on your opportunities
    as an entrepreneur. That is why we will skip cryptographic math, computer science,
    economic models, or game theory. Of course, these topics do matter: they are part
    of your arsenal as an entrepreneur, and it is to your advantage to learn as much
    about them as you can. But these topics have already been covered in other books,
    which I will mention in this book. Whenever I reference a book about cryptocurrency
    and related issues, it means that I recommend it with enthusiasm.The history of
    technology has shown how disruptions play out. Innovators build a scrappy application
    or platform that grows from obscurity, powered by a new perspective on an existing
    product. They get rapid feedback from their initial user base, taking advantage
    of their greater adaptability as a small organization until they boost the user
    experience beyond those of the legacy players. This process causes drama. Every
    technology that makes our life more efficient replaces companies that served that
    market less efficiently. For example, the invention of clay roof tiles put artisans
    of thatched roofs out of work, and the mainstream adoption of cars turned horse-drawn
    carts and carriages into quaint antiques. Likewise, Xerox machines and personal
    computers replaced armies of secretaries. We often see that technological progress

    to people’s problems, and most of us have plenty of financial challenges. Society,
    as a whole, has large-scale money problems that remain unsolved. A startup can
    tackle any one of these problems, which we will discuss one by one. By dividing
    and conquering, we can transcend the widespread economic and political challenges
    related to money and finance. Entrepreneurs have a heroic role to play; taking
    honorable risks to get rewarded for mastering these challenges. Cryptocurrencies
    are the tools to get it done.The inventors of Bitcoin and Ethereum designed them
    for smooth financial transactions. In contrast, banks have an outdated infrastructure
    with friction and hidden risk in most transactions. The entrepreneurs who drill
    into these challenges have an excellent chance to succeed with one venture or
    another. Their strategy is simple: 1) look at financial functions that make customers
    vulnerable to a third party, that is, someone other than the sender and receiver
    of an asset, and 2) automate that function on a public blockchain, which acts
    as an immutable ledger of transactions. International transfers of a cryptocurrency
    are already superior to the services of any bank or other financial institution.
    You do not even need to have an account anywhere. Furthermore, software entrepreneurs
    and finance wizards can build services that use this money without having to partner
    with a bank. Chapters 4 and 5 explore some financial solutions that don’t rely
    on the legacy banking system. Chapter 6 gives examples of successful tokenized
    assets.As I write this in 2020, only a small portion of the global population
    wants cryptocurrency. However, when Bitcoin and Ethereum work as intended, traditional
    financial products will become obsolete. In the future, other blockchain-based
    systems could become relevant as well. Where a public blockchain can replace intermediaries,
    transactions get faster while costs fall. For now, the use cases are limited to
    international payments, some illegal trades, unstoppable donations, and protection
    from inflation. We are still figuring out how to apply this technology to other
    commercial uses.From the broad adoption of paper currency until the invention
    of Bitcoin, the business of creating currency belonged to banks. They profit from
    low interest rates on loans from the central bank, they create new money, and
    they get exclusive access to the best investment opportunities. In their comfortable
    status quo, banks capture most of the value of their captive customer base. However,
    since the launch of Bitcoin, the power of banks is up for liquidation. Nowadays,
    entrepreneurs can compete for customers by using blockchains such as Bitcoin and
    Ethereum. A superior class of value propositions is now possible. We can enter
    existing but closed markets and discover new ones, for example, serving people
    who do not have bank accounts, the so-called “unbanked,” or explore new business
    models for selling digital content. We can develop products that benefit from
    the shared efforts behind open-source software. The entrepreneurs and their customers
    take the power from banks by transacting on a new network that holds cryptographically
    secured assets.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.

    adventurous. You can handle a period without the certainties of proven customs
    and established laws. You are an explorer with the guts to stake out a territory
    of freedom. If this describes you, welcome to the Wild West. Here is your map.
    Enjoy the journey.Entrepreneurs bring crypto-assets to the market to solve people’s
    financial problems. The energetic founders who see the future as open and decentralized
    have the right vision for this new technology: disruptive money. They understand
    the promise, and they are itching to build. This book is for them.Starting a company
    is an adventure because the blockchain industry resembles the Wild West. As you
    travel in the unknown terrain of Bitcoin and crypto-assets, you are going to want
    a decent map. Some can sell it to you. But who can you trust? You need some way
    of navigating this new space. You can get help from someone who has been out there
    already, who got his hands dirty and is familiar with the territory. This book
    is the “map” for an entrepreneurial venture that makes use of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    or any other blockchain flexible and secure enough for the service you plan to
    build. I based it on my hands-on experience working with blockchain entrepreneurs,
    developers, and consultants. As I was not founding an organization myself, I had
    time to observe and reflect, to make sense of the chaotic blockchain hype. I maintained
    perspective, and here I attempt to share my view with you in a way that I hope
    is useful to your entrepreneurial challenge. I worked for technology startups
    for over a decade as a consultant, copywriter, and project manager. I marketed
    high-tech value propositions. Since June 2017, I applied that skillset in startups
    that issued and traded crypto-assets. I have worked in teams that dealt with the
    challenges of designing a token economy and crafting a compelling value proposition
    for their users. I connected with entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who
    showed me their projects. I have seen a lot of brilliance, but also a lot of window
    dressing and cheap talk. Throughout the blockchain hype of 2017, I was immune
    to the aggressive marketing campaigns because I studied the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
    and to a lesser extent, the workings of several other coins. I started following
    the industry in early 2013 and began building relationships with crypto developers
    and entrepreneurs since 2014, people who were working on the first wave of alternative
    coins. I got involved more seriously in 2016, inspired by the weekly Bitcoin meetup
    in Chiang Mai, Thailand. My priority was to make sure that I knew how Bitcoin
    worked in detail. Understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin as well as its historical
    background protected me from being hypnotized by mirages or bamboozled by buzzwords.I
    want your venture to succeed because people like you will make a difference for
    the next decade of financial technology. The megatrend of decentralization, which
    gained speed with the internet, is moving into third gear with Bitcoin. I am excited
    that this ecosystem of exponential growth can take you and your venture to success.The
    best practices for blockchain ventures have their foundation in existing startup
    lore. We have the codified knowledge about starting a technology business with
    an idea and validating that idea by letting the market respond to your product.
    We have scripts for pivoting and scaling up. Now, we need to add an understanding
    of blockchains to that tradition and see how we open a new marketplace. Beyond
    a few certainties regarding Bitcoin and other blockchains, the future development
    of this technology is unknown. We will address that unknown by relying on rules
    of thumb, and we can walk through historical trends to find parallels.The book
    is organized like this:Chapter one, Disruptive Money , examines the role of money
    in the economy. To act as effective disruptors, entrepreneurs need to know their
    history. Various types of money have different origins, and people use them for
    different reasons. You can compare Bitcoin to traditional money, in terms of its
    features, advantages, and development.Chapter two, The Political Entrepreneur
    , shows how Bitcoin empowers a new kind of startup. Disruptive money systems,
    such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, define a territory of freedom, new virtual jurisdictions
    that protect the assets living on them with new security features. We can compare
    the relative security of blockchains and their resistance to the authority of
    governments.In chapter three, Liquidity and Adoption , we see that people adopt
    crypto-assets that fulfill a need. Crypto-assets with a commercial function catalyze
    a network effect. Rising liquidity makes the asset more stable, which draws new
    users, making the asset more liquid. A crypto startup has to place itself in that
    feedback loop.In Chapter four, Ideal Money , we see how a layer of secondary protocols
    can make money as efficient as information. The currency will free itself from
    the specific media that now dictate how it can move. Transacting with minimal
    friction and smart contracts could unlock new types of business.Chapter five,
    Wallet Design , is about removing any friction when handling money. The mainstream
    will only adopt crypto-assets that are easy to use; such a design is a creative
    challenge. Various hardware and software approaches make tradeoffs between convenience
    and security.Chapter six, Tokenized Assets , asks: Besides money, what else can
    we put on a blockchain? Bitcoin sets a standard for freedom and security to which
    other blockchains can aspire. Teams that aim to expand the possible use cases
    make designs for a new economy. These tokenized assets promise a future of trade
    and prosperity for the mainstream, provided that designers solve incentives, power,
    and governance.I assume that you sense the opportunities afforded by the proven
    success of well-known blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and that you are
