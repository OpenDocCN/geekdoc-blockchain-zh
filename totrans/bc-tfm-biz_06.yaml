    be used as discussed in Chapter 2: permissioned or permissionless. Bitcoin operates
    across a permissionless network, in which the users interact with each other pseudonymously.
    Users’ identities are protected by private and public key access. The bitcoin
    blockchain and other permissionless cryptocurrency networks enable corruption,
    tax evasion, and money laundering. Meanwhile, a permissioned network is one where
    users have identified themselves or provided their identity to a central authority
    to create a user account. It is this latter type of blockchain network that appeals
    to business and governments for its capacity to report transactions seamlessly
    to regulators. We explore the potential use of permissioned blockchain networks
    to enable secure and authenticated exchanges. Together with digital identities,
    users on a permissioned network can securely conduct business online, while seamlessly
    reporting activity to regulators. With a lot of business and government records

    TelexFree aggressively marketed its services by recruiting thousands of ‘promoters’

    from deliberate offences, such as failing to report cash wages in order to avoid
    tax and receive welfare payments, to the use of complex offshore secrecy arrangements

    the welfare state. The modern welfare state was designed as a comprehensive system
    through which governments provide support for all citizens in need, with a view
    to eliminating poverty and enhancing health and well-being [208]. Welfare systems
    frequently entail a wide range of living allowances paid to elderly people, unemployed
    people, those with intellectual and physical disabilities, sole parents, and students.
    Support also normally includes a range of partial, indirect, or in-kind government-funded
    benefits, such as child support payments and free or discounted medical services

    described as India’s endemic corruption with a surprise move to ban the country’s
    largest currency bills. The ban was intended to curb the flow of counterfeit money
    and to target terrorist organisations that rely on unaccounted-for cash. It was
    also expected to help the government clean up a system that has relied on cash
    to pay bribes and avoid taxes [218]. But the announcement, made on national television
    in both Hindi and English, led to an immediate upheaval in the country. Abolishing
    the current version of the 500 and 1000 rupee notes, worth about US$8 and US$15,
    effectively removed 80% of the currency in circulation [219].

    some individuals, most probably criminals, had already tried to get rid of these
    notes. A blocked sewer pipe beneath a UBS bank and nearby bistros in Switzerland
    revealed tens of thousands of high denomination euro notes that had been flushed
    down numerous toilets. A waiter in the Pizzeria du Molard told a local newspaper
    that the restaurant had called the police after the men’s toilets became blocked
    up. On investigating the cause of the blockage, staff found dozens of shredded
    €500 in the bathroom’s plumbing. Some of the notes had been shredded and investigators
    reported that they seemed to have originated from a safe deposit box in Geneva.
    Although destroying bank notes is not an offence in Switzerland, the local police
    confirmed that the case warranted further investigation. The disposal of these
    notes may be linked to illegal activities and money laundering, although at the
    time of writing the exact cause was still unclear.

- en: How can blockchain technology achieve where other anti-corruption systems have
    failed? Very simply, through trust. As the bitcoin blockchain has proven, distributed
    trustless consensus is the Blockchain’s major breakthrough. By deploying one of
    a number of zero knowledge proof mechanisms, the Blockchain can record and report
    to all users how participants are conducting themselves. To motivate users to
    behave well and to report on the good (or bad) behaviour of others, it is possible
    to give value to all transactions on a network. As such, many distributed networks
    apply game theory to incentivise good behaviour. Value could be represented by
    tokens or a crypto-coin. The tokens/coins could be converted to fiat money or
    fund data storage capacity or computational power on the blockchain (for example).
    In order to fund these rewards (or tokens), all or certain types of transactions
    on the network could be taxed. To ensure that there is no build-up of tokens or
    values in any one block or at any one time, the tokens created for tax purposes

    requirements (as discussed in [Chapter 3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml)). Indeed, there
    could be a higher reward token for those who register with or identify themselves
    to the regulator. In this way, if any users have not received a KYC/AML proof,
    then all other users would be on notice about this and would restrict or completely
    preclude transactions with that participant. The idea that use of a blockchain
    network can be funded by participants, and that consensus mechanisms can be incentivised,
    is the reason why the bitcoin blockchain has been so successful. In addition to
    meeting regulatory requirements, the blockchain has the potential to monitor the

    Permissioned blockchains can ensure that users are reporting income and meeting
