    Who am I trading with? How do I know that I’m going to get what I traded for?
    Will the other party honor our agreement? In contemporary society, these problems
    are often solved by intermediaries.

    and brokerage houses guarantee transactions. A consumer orders a shirt online,
    and the bank confirms to the vendor that the consumer can pay for it. Intermediaries
    ensure the package is delivered and the payment is received.

    can’t buy something until they are certain that the seller actually owns it. At
    each stage, ownership has to be established—that the seller possesses the goods
    to be sold and the buyer possesses the means to pay for it. The agreement must
    be made by both sides and confirmed by the intermediary.

    could fail. Clerks can make mistakes, documents can be lost, titles can be forged,
    and officials can be bribed to change records. In the global financial crisis
    of 2007–2008, banks failed to verify that new owners could pay for the houses
    they bought.

    confirmed through the blockchain ledger. Since the ledger exists in copies distributed
    all over the world, it is extremely difficult—if not impossible—to alter it without
    detection. In addition, if one part of the network fails, the ledger that proves
    ownership will still exist in other parts of the network. This decentralized network
    is thus safe from a single person, or regime, seeking to shut it down.

    which can bring many benefits. “We pay these centralized entities handsomely for
    their custodial services, not only in the form of rents they charge but in the
    control they exert over our lives,” wrote tech journalist Gideon Lewis-Kraus.
    “The blockchain, in theory, affords us new opportunities to solve complex coordination
    problems without letting the incumbent coordinators extract so much value in the
    process.”

    use a popular website to buy tickets. The website establishes that the ticket
    actually exists, confirms the exchange of the ticket between two parties, and
    then has a mechanism for delivery. For these services, the website, acting as
    an intermediary, adds a hefty fee, increasing the cost of the ticket significantly.

    holds the private key that gives her access to the address. When the owner sells
    the ticket, a new address is created for the ticket and added to the blockchain.
    The new owner receives a new private key that establishes her ownership of the
    ticket. No intermediary is needed, and no fee is added to the ticket’s cost. As
    an added bonus, the transaction is virtually instantaneous.

    applications could replace vast portions of the current financial system. New
    companies that need funding could issue tokens rather than stock. Houses could
    be bought and sold without the extensive due diligence required today.

    and conduct a transaction. To begin, Bob uses a key generation function to transform
    a big, random number into two keys: a private key and a public key. He uses his
    private key to encrypt some information and then sends the information to Alice.
    Alice, on the other end of the transaction, uses Bob’s public key to decrypt the
    message. Because the two keys were made by the same mathematical function, they
    are related to each other, so the public key verifies Bob’s private key without
    revealing it to Alice.'

    of cash machines and online banking. But the underlying system has changed remarkably
    little. It still takes twenty-four hours to wire money. The routing number at
    the bottom of paper checks was first developed a century ago. Even credit card
    transactions can take several minutes to settle. Many blockchain transactions,
    in comparison, take seconds.

    system can introduce inconsistencies, lead to errors, and offer opportunities
    for fraud. In October 2015, a number of Chipotle customers fell ill from E. coli
    bacteria. As customers fled and the company’s stock price plunged, management
    frantically searched for the source of the outbreak. The investigation, however,
    stalled. After five months, the company reported that contaminated meat from Australia
    was the likely source. They could not be more precise than that.

    are often incentivized not to work together. In fact, they often compete for business
    from the larger company. As a result, information can be inaccessible to other
    members of the supply chain, or even to the company making the orders. Managers
    at a number of restaurant chains have no way of confirming the food they receive
    meets agreed-upon standards.

    environmental crises, like the overexploitation of natural resources, and pollution,
    is because the global economy is full of actors who are doing business without
    much accountability. When you go buy something, you have no idea where it comes
    from, how it’s made. There are so many intermediaries, and it’s very easy to cheat.”

    is transparent and cannot be changed without alerting all the other people on
    the network. For example, when transporting food, the information in the log may
    include storage temperature and location, why the item was moved, and even whether
    the truck transporting the products shook too much (which can cause a significant
    loss of shelf life for some products—think bruised apples). As a result, blockchain
    can allow strangers with different goals to establish trust and work together.
    The ultimate goal is transparency that does not compromise each company’s competitive
    information. Moreover, blockchain establishes a standard ledger between parties
    that covers the details of a transaction from origin to delivery. While this structure
    by itself won’t eliminate fraud (after all, someone could deliberately enter false
    records), it establishes consistency in record keeping. Some of the largest companies
    in the world, such as IBM, Walmart, Carrefour, and Tyson Foods, have explored
    how they can use blockchain technology.

    on a ranch in northern Wyoming, a few hundred calves are logged to a blockchain.
    The blockchain allows the rancher—who raises his animals on open grassland—to
    prove to customers that his meat is higher quality and is raised humanely. Typically,
    tracking is a paper-intensive process with multiple places for errors or fraud
    as cows are traded and moved from one spot to another. Blockchain addresses these
    challenges in tracking beef.

    are about to eat. A chicken can wear a device on its foot that tracks it through
    the supply chain from farm to plate. Information about each chicken is uploaded
    to a blockchain. Diners downloading this information via an app to their smartphones
    could become the new norm. Blockchain could even come to supermarkets—one shopper

    of Fiji in the South Pacific, as well as how it was tagged with an ID and tracked
    as each individual piece was transported over thousands of miles to their plates.

    fail because supporters are not certain how their donation is being used, or whether
    a product is genuinely favorable to the environment. One group, Plastic Bank,
    tries to reduce the amount of plastic that enters the world’s oceans, where it
    has become a serious source of pollution. Plastic Bank pays individuals tokens
    for redeemed plastic bottles and other plastic waste. It then resells the plastic
    at a premium to manufacturing companies, which attracts environmentally aware
    consumers. Blockchain is essential to each part of this process. It guarantees
    payment for pieces of plastic, often in societies with no banking or high crime
    rates. It ensures that the plastic used in the recycled products is actually recycled,
    assuring the end user their purchase has helped support an environmental cause.

- en: As Bitcoin became more popular, a young Russian Canadian named Vitalik Buterin
    became excited by the potential to apply blockchain technology to a much larger
    range of transactions. Buterin was the son of a computer scientist from Grozny
    in Chechnya, a republic in southwestern Russia that was mostly destroyed in the
    1990s when Russian troops fought bitter urban battles with separatists. His father
    immigrated to Canada when Buterin was six, and he inherited much of his father’s
    disgust for governments and the havoc they could wreak.

    as just being plain evil,” Buterin told a New Yorker reporter, “and I assumed
    that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns [Homer Simpson’s
    greedy boss in The Simpsons], sitting behind their desks saying, ‘Excellent. How
    can I screw a thousand people over this time?’ ”

    system. “Their earlier pedigrees, if they had any pedigrees at all, were in open
    source—Linux, Mozilla, and cypherpunk mailing lists,” he said. “I found it immensely
    empowering that just a few thousand people like myself could re-create this fundamental
    social institution from nothing.”

- en: Buterin admired Bitcoin, but he wanted to do more than simply process transactions
    based on a digital currency. He wanted to create a peer-to-peer network that accomplished
    tasks. These tasks were set out in agreements called smart contracts.

- en: Smart contracts can connect to several blockchains and execute agreements without
    the need for human interaction. Smart contracts could be used for a guaranteed
    transaction that is based on timing, such as renting an apartment. The renter
    pays in Bitcoin, which releases a code providing access to the apartment. If the
    landlord doesn’t send the code by a certain time, then the Bitcoin is refunded
    to the renter. The smart contract automatically verifies all pieces of the transaction
    through the decentralized peer-to-peer network. This includes the landlord’s ownership
    of the apartment and the tenant’s possession of the Bitcoin to pay for it. This
    process eliminates the intermediaries, such as banks, and saves both the renter
    and the landlord money and time.

    called Ether to pay the computers on the peer-to-peer network to execute smart
    contracts. Buterin described his creation as “Android for decentralized apps”—leading
    him to call the smart contracts “Dapps.” Buterin compared Ethereum to a smartphone
    that is programmed to perform the apps (or “Dapps”) on its platform. In effect,
    programmers on Ethereum had access to a decentralized supercomputer.

- en: Buterin and many blockchain supporters hoped Ethereum and other blockchain platforms
    would help address a major problem. Most people’s experiences on the internet
    were absorbed onto massive platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The
    platforms had started out as places where people could simply carry out tasks,
    such as “search” or “buy an item,” or connect with another person or group. But
    over time, the platforms appeared more and more to be dictating these experiences.
    Through tracking and gathering of data, they used algorithms to deliver information
    and advertisements to users. Worse, they demanded the user surrender their personal
    information to have access to the platform. Many hoped that blockchain could eliminate
    these intermediaries and restore the original promise of the internet.
