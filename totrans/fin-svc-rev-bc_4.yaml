- en: A simple foreign exchange (FX) transaction between banks in two countries can
    involve many players. The traders (or their computers) agree on the amount, the
    exchange rate, and the future settlement date of the transaction, which (for simple
    spot contracts) is typically tomorrow or the day after.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For a simple case, the financial institutions involved need to ensure that the
    funds are on deposit and available through the central banks of those countries
    with the currencies involved on the date that the transaction settles. On that
    settlement date when both central bank clearing systems are up and running, an
    inter-central bank clearing system known as CLS, an acronym originally for continuously
    linked settlement, coordinates the near-simultaneous bidirectional transfer of
    funds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the banks involved do not have accounts at CLS, then they typically must
    go through banks that do. To those outside the system, it is about the movement
    of money. To those inside, it is the movement of debits and credits, with historical
    audit trails as secured and trusted records, through many dual-entry accounting
    systems. In truth, it is simply the movement of trusted and regulated bits. Yes,
    it is just bits.

    the clearing systems of the currencies in their respective countries, the correspondent

    trust the mathematics proven to secure token movements and their messages over
    the trust in the many institutions (and their costs) to maintain their systems
    properly. Why can those tokens not be dollars or euros? The answer is that they
    can be and, we will argue, soon will be.

    provable log of activity. It combined public and private key cryptography to verify
    identity and a consensus algorithm to verify transactions and prevent duplicate
    or fraudulent spend, all in a peer-to-peer network. There is no requirement for
    centralized control. Each feature is not revolutionary. All were available in

    It specializes and profits from managing and mitigating international trust issues
    between buyers and sellers that have no historical trusting relationship. Their
    major financial instrument to do so is called a letter of credit (LoC). This is
    a complex set of documents between four or often more parties that each trust
    one of the other parties that, in effect, link together for a transaction in a
    chain of trust.

    else that they trust who trusts someone else who trusts another party, who trusts
    yet another someone that trusts the seller. It sounds completely unworkable, but
    for centuries these LoC were (and, largely, still are) the financial basis for
    international commerce. So, for example, one bank would pay for the goods (and
    accept the risk) when they were manufactured to spec and available for shipment.
    This bank was then paid by another bank (who would then accept the transit risk)
    when the goods arrived and were inspected at the dock for export. This bank would
    then be paid by yet another bank (who would then pay and accept the next phase
    in the transit risk) when the goods arrived at the importer’s docks. This bank
    was then paid by another, the bank of the ultimate buyer, when the goods arrived
    as ordered and inspected on the delivery dock of the purchaser. The complexity
    of documenting and negotiating the lengthy terms and conditions of these deals
    for their successful execution is slow and expensive (Figure 4-2).

    systems to avoid settlement risk may queue the funds temporarily overnight. In

    or three nights. For profitable use of the funds, the banks may hold the currency
    much longer. Nevertheless, the consumer, confronted with an opaque process, is
    told that the funds are “in transit.” We can track a $50 international Amazon

    the differences in timing in settling the two halves of an FX transaction. More
    specifically, CLS is an international multicurrency clearing system designed to
    ensure that both sides of an FX contract are executed simultaneously, with certainty,
    and with the finality of payment in two different countries clearing systems.
    The CLS system settles payment instructions of underlying FX transactions in 18
    currencies through accounts with 18 countries’ central banks.²⁴¹ The technical
    coordination of that many banks’ computers with each other in that many countries
    in that many time zones is not a trivial task.

    in the world.²⁴² Each settlement member (typically a bank) holds a single multicurrency
    account with CLS. At the start and end of a normal settlement day, each settlement
    member and each central bank has a zero balance in its account. It is not a “lender
    of last resort.” Settlement members may submit payment instructions relating to
    their own FX transactions as well as the FX transactions of their third-party
    customers directly to CLS. CLS maintains accounts with each of the central banks
    whose currencies settle through CLS. CLS, settlement members, and the national
    RTGS systems of many countries communicate via SWIFT messages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and countries at times when both countries’ central bank systems are open to send
    and receive payments. This enables concurrent settlement of the payments on both
    sides of an FX transaction, say, across the Atlantic.²⁴³ If exchanging dollars
    for pounds, the movement of the two currencies (dollars in New York and pounds
    in London) is thus coordinated in the short time window when both systems’ central
    bank clearing systems are concurrently accessible.

    is known as Herstatt risk. In CLS’ defense, during the crash of 2008, it accomplished
    its primary mission of keeping FX markets liquid, when many other markets froze.²⁴⁵
    Without CLS, it is probable that in the 2008 bank crisis, FX payments would have
    been frozen and the Great Recession could have been far worse.

    existing order of fiat currencies and central banks. Why? Because they are too
    volatile, too risky, too energy intensive, and because the underlying technologies
    are not yet scalable. Many are too opaque for regulators; and some have been hacked.

    the de facto currency of the illicit Silk Road site. It is also of great interest

    Identity management is an issue still under much discussion. Knowing one’s customers
    is a prerequisite to honoring sanctions and avoiding money laundering. We could
    debate whether, in the long view, the “full faith and credit” of a government
    can compete with the mathematical integrity of a cryptocurrency. They need not
    be mutually exclusive. They could even be merged. In response to the US Faster
    Payments Task Force, WingCash created a “national digital currency platform proposed
    for use by the Federal Reserve that extends the US dollar into the digital realm.”³¹³
    This seems inevitable.

    mathematically and economically viable. Instead of proof of work or proof of stake,
    it would be based on proof-of-authority consensus, where the central banks are
    the authority. With such a definition, a central bank could slowly transform its
    fiat currency into a cryptocurrency. Some see a world without central banks. But
    they perform so many management functions, that this seems improbable.

    and Ethereum, with DLT (or DLT-like) software aggressively entering smaller markets
    and then, once proven, moving to larger ones. Moving from national payments (with
    the permission and direction of one central bank) is far easier than negotiating
    the politics of transborder payments. The small scale of the city-state of Singapore,
