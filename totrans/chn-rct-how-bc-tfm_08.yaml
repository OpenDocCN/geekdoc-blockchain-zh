    explored: while there are plenty of instances of problems faced by developing
    countries where blockchain might help (and others where it certainly won’t), the
    most frequent sticking point is government. How will governments respond to electronic
    payment systems that could dent the national sovereignty of the currency , undermine
    control over monetary policy or, at the very least, prevent some ruling party
    cronies creaming kickbacks? How will political leaders take to disruption by a
    decentralized system that will make it harder to retain jobs for their patronage
    networks, let alone find money to reward loyalty?'

    that people will continue to seek innovative solutions and that blockchain-based
    systems will be the best answer to address several significant issues. Blockchain
    will be used when systems of trust are weak plus the conditions needed for a traditional
    or legacy system to take root are also weak or non-existent: in other words, when the
    value of the blockchain solution outweighs the value delivered by more traditional
    methods.'

    being applied in a situation where a database might be an otherwise perfectly
    adequate technical solution in a developed world context. The UK has a national,
    voluntary property registration database called Immobilise , as discussed in Chap.
    6\. The database is operated by the police, in such a way that anyone can register
    property by uploading pictures and proofs of ownership and recording key details,
    like serial numbers. Should you have the misfortune of having your bicycle, camera
    or computer stolen, the information in the database can be used to help the police
    recover the stolen goods and to expedite an insurance claim. This exact model
    could be transferred to a developing country, with a central database operated
    by the police.

    to review the coded rules and parameters—could help to develop trust in the system
    more quickly, especially where corruption and kickbacks are an issue. People might
    have less confidence listing their valuables on a database that could be seen
    by tax authorities or, in some countries, ruling party cronies, thugs and criminal
    gangs. The police might also, quite reasonably, have more immediate concerns than
    developing such a database.

    scenario, which we will call the Big Bet, is one in which governments and major
    companies in developing countries embrace blockchain technology to improve public
    services and serve their customers better. In this world, the police, for example,
    would establish a database, leveraging blockchain technology to strengthen and
    deepen governance.

    have not been able to address.

    do two remarkable things: they recognize that they have a set of problems linked
    to trust , and they look to embrace new technologies , particularly blockchain
    , to solve these problems. This is a world in which, with the blessing of government
    regulators, companies look to blockchain technologies to offer trusted services
    to their customers, and governments leapfrog existing approaches to e-government
    and go straight to blockchains to provide a secure, trusted service. The benefits
    are tremendous, but the Big Bet encapsulates a big leap of faith. Like most leaps
    of faith, the Big Bet does not happen as a single leap, but rather as a series
    of incremental regulatory and legal changes that collectively pave the way for
    blockchain technology to play a significant role in the economy.'

    similar in the developing world, with demonstrable impact. In contrast to most
    countries, especially developing countries that heavily regulated their newly
    established mobile phone networks, Kenya allowed mobile phone networks substantial
    latitude to experiment with new models for providing both telecommunications and
    financial services. Mobile money systems are now common across the developing
    world, but Kenya is still recognized as an early leader.

    was introduced to solve one identifiable problem, namely how to exchange money
    in economies with limited access to banking services and often limited cash. Blockchain,
    however, is a new infrastructure for solving many different problems. In this
    sense, it’s akin to embracing mobile technology as a solution for multiple issues
    simultaneously.

    technologies evolve, improved systems for identity , property registration and
    other use cases lower the barriers to participating in the formal economy. Combined
    with innovative approaches to credit scoring and continued advances in digital
    banking, the potential exists for financial services to more efficiently and effectively
    reach the unbanked. Meanwhile, blockchain-based systems accelerate the roll-out
    and security of e-government, making it easier for new firms to challenge incumbents,
    increasing the dynamism and productivity of the economy. Cryptocurrencies and
    widespread use of digital payment systems reduce transaction costs, remove opportunities
    for corruption and offer an alternative to the weaknesses of existing national
    currencies . Trusted systems of authentication and record create a base layer
    environment that lowers barriers to entry and inspire new business models.

    of existing mobile payments businesses into e-commerce channels, and reducing
    costs for companies seeking to embrace economically viable strategies focused
    on developing new products for the poor. Widening the formal economy enables governments
    in the Big Bet scenario to broaden the tax base at the same time as blockchain-based
    technology improves service delivery and voting, reducing political risk .'

    developing country households. Even if the purchaser has little formal credit
    history, in the Big Bet scenario their use of digital money and their blockchain-based
    single national identity form the basis for a bank to make an informed lending
    decision. Having secured a loan, the purchaser continues to build a credit history.
    Because the purchase has been formalized and is linked to the buyer’s digital
    identity , it is straightforward for the government to charge VAT on the purchase,
    expanding the tax base. The introduction of these digital channels also reduces
    barriers to the bank serving customers like our borrower, expanding the bank’s
    revenue and margins. This leads to the bank making both more loans, thereby supporting
    economic growth, and more profit, thereby increasing the tax paid by the bank.
    The title of the motorcycle is held electronically on a blockchain-based property
    register . Eventually, when the owner is ready to sell the motorcycle and buy
    a car, the buyer of the used motorbike can use that property registration to verify
    the ownership of the motorcycle and whether the original loan guaranteed by the
    bike remains outstanding.

    the risk of theft and support transactions. From Central Asia to Central Africa,
    major purchases are frequently made with huge stacks of low denomination bank
    notes. The process often involves having to travel many hours to a bank to obtain
    the notes in the first place. In Malawi , for example, the largest denomination
    note is worth US$2.75, so even the purchase of a used motorcycle might require
    a stack of more than 150 notes. In some of Malawi’s more economically successful
    communities, such as fishing villages on the islands in Lake Malawi , a prospective
    purchaser would need to travel five hours each way on a weekly, frequently delayed
    colonial-era ferry to withdraw the money to purchase the motorbike. The complexity
    of getting cash complicates and sometimes prevents transactions from taking place.
    Cryptocurrencies and other digital money solutions are clearly an appealing alternative,
    and official support for cryptocurrencies would help to encourage mobile operators
    and banks to facilitate bringing this technology to a wider population.^([1](#Fn1))

    Know scenario also unfolds in a sequential manner. Rather than embracing something
    new, governments and incumbent corporations stick to existing systems, technologies
    and approaches: “better the devil you know.” Governments gradually introduce wide-ranging
    regulation that clamps down on the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology
    in order both to “protect” the public from cryptocurrency volatility and to respond
    to various high-profile cases of cryptocurrencies being used to evade taxes, circumvent
    foreign exchange controls, launder money and otherwise subvert the state’s role
    in managing effective monetary policy. This regulatory clampdown in pariah states,
    like Venezuela and Zimbabwe , serves only to remove a potential pathway out of
    economic collapse. The need is also particularly felt in countries like Nigeria
    and Kenya , where bitcoin represents a relatively large share of GDP .^([2](#Fn2))'

    presumption of official resistance leads domestic businesses and financial institutions
    in developing countries to choose not to invest in blockchain-based solutions.
    Instead, they emulate the model of centralized trust used in developed countries.
    With the risk of competition from new blockchain-based business models apparently
    removed, incumbents are under less pressure to innovate and improve.

    to solve the real problems of their daily lives, adopting technology solutions
    from overseas to adapt to the lack of trust in their own societies. For example,

    the most difficult countries in the world in which to register property, for people

    for governments to maintain economic restrictions and control. Without the ability
    to rely on official institutions of trust , much of developing nations’ economic
    activity remains in the informal economy and the availability of non-state systems
    of trust allow that economic activity to deepen in sophistication. This undermines
    both the government’s ability to tax and, as more assets are held in possibly
    elicit cryptocurrency form rather than in banks, the financial system’s ability
    to intermediate credit to the real economy.

    the purchaser has a meaningful financial history in their various cryptocurrency
    and mobile money transactions, the lack of official support for these digital
    channels means that this history cannot be used by a locally regulated bank as
    the basis for a loan. Instead, the purchaser is forced to take several unsecured
    loans from fintechs that are equipped to use this financial history to make a
    credit decision. Without a national digital identity , it is difficult for anyone
    other than the borrower herself to assess her total indebtedness, raising the
    risk of excessive borrowing. Lenders compensate for this risk with higher interest
    rates. Loans are disbursed in both cryptocurrency and mobile money that can be
    withdrawn as cash from local agents, pending availability of actual notes.

    does so using a combination of cryptocurrency , physical cash and mobile money

    registration platform based in Europe that offers free service for registration
    of low-value (by Western standards) assets to consumers in the developing world.
    Having completed the purchase, the new owner registers the motorcycle in her own
    name on the same overseas platform. Because the actual motorcycle purchase happens
    informally, no tax is paid. Rather the government imposes transaction taxes on
    those fintechs and mobile money providers that come under its purview.

    Bet, but too many will hew closely to the Devil You Know, depriving their citizens,
    and themselves, of the wider political and economic benefits that blockchain technology
    could deliver. Sadly, we are beginning to see the signs already of some countries—notably
    Nigeria—adopting the Devil You Know approach. There is a critical role here for
    intergovernmental institutions, NGOs, and global leaders and influencers to champion
    the permanent transition made possible by technology to a world in which transparency
    keeps business honest and holds government to account.
