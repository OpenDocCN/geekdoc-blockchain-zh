    manager, Josh Mohrer, after BuzzFeed journalist Johana Bhuiyan reported that he
    had used the God’s view feature to monitor her movements. The outcry over this

    used as launchpads to direct attacks on other parts of the Internet. When the
    hacker published a how-to list of instructions, some rogue actors inevitably gave
    their approach a whirl. Taking control of multiple devices, these malefactors
    launched a massive distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack against Dyn, a

    cybersecurity tools such as firewalls, and with a tempting “bounty” of more than
    $160 billion in market cap value at the time we went to print, Bitcoin’s core
    ledger has thus far proven to be unhackable. Based on the ledger’s own standards
    for integrity, Bitcoin’s nine-year experience of survival provides pretty solid
    proof of the resiliency of its core mechanism for providing decentralized trust
    between users. It suggests that one of the most important non-currency applications
    of Bitcoin’s blockchain could be security itself.

- en: One reason why Bitcoin has survived is because it leaves hackers nothing to
    hack. The public ledger contains no identifying information about the system’s
    users. Even more important, no one owns or controls that ledger. There is no single
    master version; with every batch of confirmed transactions, the so-called blocks
    of the blockchain, a new, updated version of the entire ledger is created and
    relayed to every node. As such, there is no central vector of attack. If one node
    on the network is compromised and someone tries to undo or rewrite transactions
    in that node’s local version of the ledger, the nodes controlling the hundreds
    of other accepted versions will simply refuse to include data from the compromised
    node in the updates. The contradiction between the many clean versions and the
    one that’s been altered will automatically label the compromised block as false.
    As we’ll discuss further in the book, there are varying degrees of security in
    different blockchain designs, including those known as “private” or “permissioned”
    blockchains, which rely on central authorities to approve participants. In contrast,
    Bitcoin is based on a decentralized model that eschews approvals and instead banks
    on the participants caring enough about their money in the system to protect it.
    Still, across all examples, the basic, shared, and replicated nature of all blockchain
    ledgers, in which the common record of truth resides in multiple locations, underpins
    this core idea of distributed security, that the risk of failure is backstopped
    by multiple “redundancies.”

    2016, at a symposium organized by the financial securities settlement and clearing
    agency Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., or DTCC, the audience, filled with bankers
    and representatives of companies that support them, was asked to vote on what
    IT sector they would invest in tomorrow if they had $10 million to deploy. From
    a menu of options, the votes came back, with the majority in favor of investing
    in “cybersecurity” services, and “blockchain” opportunities second. On stage at
    the time, Adam Ludwin, the CEO of blockchain/distributed ledger services company
    Chain Inc., took advantage of the result to call out Wall Street firms for failing
    to see how this technology offers a different paradigm. Ludwin, whose clients
    include household names like Visa and Nasdaq, said he could understand why people
    saw a continued market for cybersecurity services, since his audience was full
    of people paid to worry about data breaches constantly. But their answers suggested
    they didn’t understand that the blockchain offered a solution. Unlike other system-design
    software, for which cybersecurity is an add-on, this technology “incorporates
    security by design,” he said.

- en: For the private “permissioned” blockchains that Wall Street is typically exploring—distributed
    ledger models in which all the validating computers must be pre-authorized to
    join the network—Ludwin’s “by design” notion refers solely to the fact that the
    data is distributed among many nodes rather than held solely by one. The advantage
    is that this structure creates multiple redundancies, or backups, that can keep
    the network running if one node is compromised. A more radical solution is to
    embrace open, “permissionless” blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where there’s
    no central authority keeping track of who’s using the network. And in that case,
    the entire security paradigm—the question of what constitutes “security”—changes.
    It’s not about building a firewall up around a centralized pool of valuable data
    controlled by a trusted third party; rather the focus is on pushing control over
    information out to the edges of the network, to the people themselves, and on
    limiting the amount of identifying information that’s communicated publicly. Importantly,
    it’s also about making it prohibitively expensive for someone to try to steal
    valuable information.

    remarkably secure. Bitcoin’s core ledger has never been successfully attacked.
    Now, it will undoubtedly be a major challenge to get the institutions that until
    now have been entrusted with securing our data systems to let go and defer security
    to some decentralized network in which there is no identifiable authority to sue
    if something goes wrong. But doing so might just be the most important step they
    can take to improve data security. It will require them to think about security
    not as a function of superior encryption and other external protections, but in
    terms of economics, of making attacks so expensive that they’re not worth the
    effort.

    the new “device identity model” that Bitcoin’s blockchain could facilitate. Currently,

    mnemonics—“Your pet’s name?”—to manage access. But that still leaves all the vital
    data, potentially worth billions of dollars, sitting in a hackable repository
    on the company’s servers. With a permissionless blockchain, control over the data
    stays with the customer, which means that the point of vulnerability lies with
    their device. So instead of Visa’s servers containing the vital identifying information
    that’s needed for hundreds of millions of cardholders to access its payments network,
    the right to access a network is managed solely by you, on your phone, your computer.
    A hacker could go after each device, try to steal the private key that’s used
    to initiate transactions on the decentralized network, and, if they’re lucky,
    get away with a few thousand dollars in bitcoin. But it’s far less lucrative and

    Sockets Layer) certificates to verify the trustworthiness of Web site encryption
    systems. Meanwhile, card-issuing banks beefed up their anti-fraud monitoring efforts.
    A version of the “trusted third party” was added to our complicated system of
    global value exchange. It was another jury-rigged solution that meant that the
    banking system, the centralized ledger-keeping solution with which society had
    solved the double-spend problem for five hundred years, would be awkwardly bolted

    in online shopping ensued. But the gatekeeping moneymen now added costs and inefficiencies
    to the system. The result was high per-transaction costs that made it too expensive,
    for example, to sustain micropayments—extremely low payments, maybe as little
    as pennies, that otherwise promised to open up a whole new world of online business
    models. That nixed a dream of early Internet visionaries, who saw that idea feeding
    into a global marketplace where software, storage, media content, and processing
    power would be bought and sold in fractional amounts to maximize efficiency. The
    compromise also meant that credit cards, once an elite-only instrument, became
    an integral, even necessary component of e-commerce infrastructure, making banks
    even more relevant to our payments system. Under this model, the banks charged
    merchants an interchange fee of around 3 percent to cover their anti-fraud costs,
    adding a hidden tax to the digital economy that we all pay in the form of higher
    prices.

    effects; they’ve been indirectly protected by the hefty transaction costs that
    competitors face in trying to grow to the same scale. In a very tangible way,
    then, the high cost of trust management has fed the economic conditions that allow
    the likes of Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Facebook to keep squashing competitors.

    fellow band of libertarian advocates for cryptography, privacy, and an online
    world of individual empowerment. Those geeky rebels of the 1990s Bay Area wanted
    an Internet that was free of both government and corporatist control, a decentralized
    online economy where self-expression was devoid of censorship, where anyone could
    transact with anyone else under whatever identity they chose. Ideas like Ted Nelson’s
    ill-fated Xanadu project, which never achieved anywhere near its lofty vision
    of a global network of independent, self-publishing, interlinked, fully autonomous
    computers, envisaged a network in which far more processing power and data was
    placed under the control of individual owners’ computers. They were ideas that

    who controlled the data didn’t matter. Its integrity could be assured by a decentralized
    network that constantly updated itself through a process of unbreakable consensus.

    up with the category-defying changes that cryptocurrency poses. It took two years
    for the New York Department of Financial Services to come up with its benchmark-setting
    BitLicense regulation for money transmission with digital currencies like bitcoin.
    By the time it was enacted in 2015, the crypto world had moved on to smart contracts
    and Ethereum; now it’s all about utility tokens, initial coin offerings, and decentralized
    autonomous organizations—none of which were foreseen by the regulation’s authors.
    One risk is that regulators, confused by all these outside-the-box concepts, will
    overreact to some bad news—potentially triggered by large-scale investor losses
    if and when the ICO bubble bursts and exposes a host of scams. The fear is that
    a new set of draconian catchall measures would suck the life out of innovation
    in this space or drive it offshore or underground. To be sure, institutions like
    the Washington-based Coin Center and the Digital Chamber of Commerce are doing
    their best to keep officials aware of the importance of keeping their respective
    jurisdictions competitive in what is now a global race to lead the world in financial
    technology. But we live in unpredictable political times in which, to say the

    a global network will execute the randomly assigned instructions contained within
    a smart contract? Advocates for these new ideas might argue that new laws aren’t

    could be a substitute for real-world law, that all disputes would be resolved
    by these automatic machines, only that code shares some of the qualities of law
    in the way it proscribes the behavior of computing components. To see code as
    a substitute for the law is to reduce the latter to something far smaller than
    what it is. If the law were merely a set of instructions and rules, then yes,
    perhaps we could just have computers, working together in algorithmic concert,
    arbitrating and executing all of our digital exchanges with each other. But the
    law goes much, much deeper and much, much broader than that. The philosophical
    question of “what is law?” can prompt a host of different answers, but the more
    you dig into the concept the harder it is to separate law from what Carl Jung
    called our “collective unconscious,” a set of ideas about how to treat each other
    that we’ve inherited from prior generations and iteratively altered over millennia.

    DAO attack of June 2016\. The DAO stands for The Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
    In using this name, the founders of The DAO appropriated an acronym that had until
    then been used as a generic description of a variety of new, and potentially valuable,
    systems of automated corporate management and attached it to an extreme expression
    of techno-anarchic ideals. The DAO was an investment fund established by Slock.it,
    a smart contracts development group founded by Ethereum’s former chief commercial
    officer, Stephan Tual, and two others. This entity, The DAO, was to be entirely
    managed by software code—no CEO, no board of directors, no managers of any kind.
    This kind of thing had been talked about in theory, but these guys were the first
    ones to give it a shot. The basic idea was that the platform would allow the funds’
    investors to vote on how to allocate its money—that is, to select from a variety
    of proposed projects. The idea was that a more democratic, and supposedly superior,
    investment logic would emerge than that of traditional funds, where fund managers’
    interests don’t always align with those of their principals.

    submitted business proposals. After that, the contributions, dividends, and distributions
    would all be handled according to the Ethereum-based smart contract that ran The
    DAO. The concept sparked an inordinate amount of excitement among decentralization
    utopians within the crypto community, who saw it as a way to prove that effective
    economic decisions could be made without relying on third-party institutions,

    Creation of DAO tokens and supersede[s] any public statements about The DAO’s
    Creation made by third parties or individuals associated with The DAO, past, present
    and future.” This was a bold—and, as it would turn out, poorly conceived—statement.

    participant who’d figured out that if he or she wrote a program to interact with
    the smart contract, it could constantly ask for and receive funds, sent to a copycat
    DAO that they controlled. The attacker built a virtual version of an out-of-control

    behavior, we need to have a specification of the wanted behavior. We had no such
    specification for The DAO.… The ‘code was its own documentation,’ as people say.

    than the developers themselves.… Had the attacker lost money by mistake, I am

    ‘this is what happens in the brave new world of programmatic money flows.’ When
    he instead emptied out coins from The DAO, the only consistent response is to

    trust into a blockchain. Bitcoin purists believe that users need not trust anyone
    with whom they enter into a transfer of bitcoin currency. The record of their
    transactions is generated according to a distributed software program that no
    one controls, and when currency is transferred to other users, that exchange is
    verified by a decentralized system that requires no “trusted third party’s” adjudication
    and has no need to identify the users. But in reality, Bitcoin users can’t get
    away from having to trust someone or something. For one, the payment is only one
    part of the transaction; there’s nothing in the software that ensures that the
    merchant delivers the goods or services offered in return. Bitcoin users also
    must trust that data being input into the record is reliable. How do you know
    the smartphone or PC you are using to give instructions to the Bitcoin network
    hasn’t been compromised? How do you know that when you are typing “6f7Hl92ej”
    on your keyboard, those characters are the ones being conveyed to the Bitcoin
    network? We have little choice but to trust that Apple, Samsung, and other manufacturers
    are using strict supply-chain monitoring systems to ensure that attackers haven’t
    put malware into the chips. This is not to sound paranoid, because the fact is
    that, even in the face of constant cyberbreaches, we all choose to trust our computers.

    depend on the attestation of some authority figure such as a government registrar.
    This dependence on a trusted middleman, some cryptocurrency purists would argue,
    overly compromises a blockchain’s security function, rendering it unreliable.
    For that reason, some of them say, a blockchain is inappropriate for many non-currency
    applications. We, however, view it as a trade-off and believe there’s still plenty
    of value in recording ownership rights and transfers to digitally represented
    real-world assets in blockchains. We must, however, be aware of that trust component
    and establish acceptable standards for how data from such sources is gathered

    it’s an enabler of more trustful relations. What it does do is widen the perimeter
    of trust. While the software removes centralized trust from the internal ledger-keeping
    process inside the blockchain, we must trust other people in the “off-chain” environment.
    We have to trust that a merchant will fulfill a promise to deliver goods on time,
    that a provider of some source of key information like a stock market price-feed
    is accurate, or that the smartphones or computers we use to input information
    haven’t been compromised at the manufacturing stage. As we go about designing
    new governance systems based on this technology, we need to think hard about best
    practices as they exist at that outer rim—the “last mile” of verification, as

    blockchain—are by definition more prone to gatekeeping controls, and therefore

    that Bitcoin represents. (We say “ideal” because, as we’ll discuss in the next
