    message from a friend, Julia Allison, wondering if he happened to be in an Uber
    SUV near 33rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York. It happened that this was exactly

    manager, Josh Mohrer, after BuzzFeed journalist Johana Bhuiyan reported that he
    had used the God’s view feature to monitor her movements. The outcry over this

    hack. The public ledger contains no identifying information about the system’s
    users. Even more important, no one owns or controls that ledger. There is no single
    master version; with every batch of confirmed transactions, the so-called blocks
    of the blockchain, a new, updated version of the entire ledger is created and
    relayed to every node. As such, there is no central vector of attack. If one node
    on the network is compromised and someone tries to undo or rewrite transactions
    in that node’s local version of the ledger, the nodes controlling the hundreds
    of other accepted versions will simply refuse to include data from the compromised
    node in the updates. The contradiction between the many clean versions and the
    one that’s been altered will automatically label the compromised block as false.
    As we’ll discuss further in the book, there are varying degrees of security in
    different blockchain designs, including those known as “private” or “permissioned”
    blockchains, which rely on central authorities to approve participants. In contrast,
    Bitcoin is based on a decentralized model that eschews approvals and instead banks
    on the participants caring enough about their money in the system to protect it.
    Still, across all examples, the basic, shared, and replicated nature of all blockchain
    ledgers, in which the common record of truth resides in multiple locations, underpins

    agency Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., or DTCC, the audience, filled with bankers
    and representatives of companies that support them, was asked to vote on what
    IT sector they would invest in tomorrow if they had $10 million to deploy. From
    a menu of options, the votes came back, with the majority in favor of investing
    in “cybersecurity” services, and “blockchain” opportunities second. On stage at
    the time, Adam Ludwin, the CEO of blockchain/distributed ledger services company
    Chain Inc., took advantage of the result to call out Wall Street firms for failing
    to see how this technology offers a different paradigm. Ludwin, whose clients
    include household names like Visa and Nasdaq, said he could understand why people
    saw a continued market for cybersecurity services, since his audience was full
    of people paid to worry about data breaches constantly. But their answers suggested
    they didn’t understand that the blockchain offered a solution. Unlike other system-design
    software, for which cybersecurity is an add-on, this technology “incorporates
    security by design,” he said.

  zh: 这并不是大公司通常考虑安全性的方式。然而，在2016年3月，由金融证券清算机构Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.（DTCC）组织的研讨会上，观众中有银行家和支持他们的公司的代表，被要求投票，如果他们有1,000万美元需要投资明天的IT部门，他们会选择哪个领域。在多个选项中，投票结果显示大多数人支持投资于“网络安全”服务，其次是“区块链”机会。当时在台上，区块链/分布式分类账服务公司Chain
    Inc.的CEO亚当·拉德温（Adam Ludwin）利用这个结果批评了华尔街公司未能看到这项技术带来的不同模式。拉德温的客户包括Visa和纳斯达克等知名公司，他说他能理解为什么人们认为网络安全服务市场仍会持续存在，因为他的听众是为了不断担心数据泄露而获得报酬的人们。但他们的答案表明他们并不了解区块链提供了一种解决方案。拉德温表示，与其他系统设计软件不同，对于这项技术，“安全性是内在设计的”，而不是后期添加的。
- en: For the private “permissioned” blockchains that Wall Street is typically exploring—distributed
    ledger models in which all the validating computers must be pre-authorized to
    join the network—Ludwin’s “by design” notion refers solely to the fact that the
    data is distributed among many nodes rather than held solely by one. The advantage
    is that this structure creates multiple redundancies, or backups, that can keep
    the network running if one node is compromised. A more radical solution is to
    embrace open, “permissionless” blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where there’s
    no central authority keeping track of who’s using the network. And in that case,
    the entire security paradigm—the question of what constitutes “security”—changes.
    It’s not about building a firewall up around a centralized pool of valuable data
    controlled by a trusted third party; rather the focus is on pushing control over
    information out to the edges of the network, to the people themselves, and on
    limiting the amount of identifying information that’s communicated publicly. Importantly,
    it’s also about making it prohibitively expensive for someone to try to steal
    valuable information.

    their identities could be safe from attackers. But the fact is that the incentive
    and costs that these software programs impose on actors in the system have proven
    remarkably secure. Bitcoin’s core ledger has never been successfully attacked.
    Now, it will undoubtedly be a major challenge to get the institutions that until
    now have been entrusted with securing our data systems to let go and defer security
    to some decentralized network in which there is no identifiable authority to sue
    if something goes wrong. But doing so might just be the most important step they
    can take to improve data security. It will require them to think about security
    not as a function of superior encryption and other external protections, but in
    terms of economics, of making attacks so expensive that they’re not worth the
    effort.

- en: Let’s compare our current “shared-secret model” for protecting information with
    the new “device identity model” that Bitcoin’s blockchain could facilitate. Currently,
    a service provider and a customer agree on a secret password and perhaps certain
    mnemonics—“Your pet’s name?”—to manage access. But that still leaves all the vital
    data, potentially worth billions of dollars, sitting in a hackable repository
    on the company’s servers. With a permissionless blockchain, control over the data
    stays with the customer, which means that the point of vulnerability lies with
    their device. So instead of Visa’s servers containing the vital identifying information
    that’s needed for hundreds of millions of cardholders to access its payments network,
    the right to access a network is managed solely by you, on your phone, your computer.
    A hacker could go after each device, try to steal the private key that’s used
    to initiate transactions on the decentralized network, and, if they’re lucky,
    get away with a few thousand dollars in bitcoin. But it’s far less lucrative and
    far more time-consuming than going after the rich target of a central server.

    Visa 的服务器包含了数亿持卡人访问其支付网络所需的重要身份信息，不如说访问网络的权限完全由你自己在你的手机、你的电脑上管理。黑客可能会攻击每个设备，尝试窃取用于在去中心化网络上发起交易的私钥，并且，如果他们幸运的话，可能会成功地得到几千美元的比特币。但这比攻击一个中央服务器这样的富有目标要不太有利可图，而且更加耗时。

- en: But even with this new challenge in terms of device protection, we should see
    a dramatic reduction in the number of attacks. The crucial point here is that
    the potential payoff for the hacker is so much smaller for each attack. Rather
    than accessing millions of accounts at once, he or she has to pick off each device
    one by one for comparatively tiny amounts. It’s an incentives-weighted concept

    and Ethereum; now it’s all about utility tokens, initial coin offerings, and decentralized
    autonomous organizations—none of which were foreseen by the regulation’s authors.
    One risk is that regulators, confused by all these outside-the-box concepts, will
    overreact to some bad news—potentially triggered by large-scale investor losses

    In using this name, the founders of The DAO appropriated an acronym that had until

    systems of automated corporate management and attached it to an extreme expression
    of techno-anarchic ideals. The DAO was an investment fund established by Slock.it,
    a smart contracts development group founded by Ethereum’s former chief commercial
    officer, Stephan Tual, and two others. This entity, The DAO, was to be entirely
    managed by software code—no CEO, no board of directors, no managers of any kind.
    This kind of thing had been talked about in theory, but these guys were the first
    ones to give it a shot. The basic idea was that the platform would allow the funds’
    investors to vote on how to allocate its money—that is, to select from a variety
    of proposed projects. The idea was that a more democratic, and supposedly superior,
    investment logic would emerge than that of traditional funds, where fund managers’
    interests don’t always align with those of their principals.

    trust into a blockchain. Bitcoin purists believe that users need not trust anyone
    with whom they enter into a transfer of bitcoin currency. The record of their

    one controls, and when currency is transferred to other users, that exchange is
    verified by a decentralized system that requires no “trusted third party’s” adjudication
    and has no need to identify the users. But in reality, Bitcoin users can’t get
    away from having to trust someone or something. For one, the payment is only one
    part of the transaction; there’s nothing in the software that ensures that the
    merchant delivers the goods or services offered in return. Bitcoin users also
    must trust that data being input into the record is reliable. How do you know

    network? We have little choice but to trust that Apple, Samsung, and other manufacturers

  zh: 最后，市场框架周围可能存在一个潜在的有争议的问题——即哪些计算机控制着区块链，以及如何控制价格、访问权限和市场主导地位。需要许可的区块链——即需要某些授权实体批准验证区块链的计算机——从定义上更容易受到门户控制，因此更容易出现垄断或寡头力量，而不像比特币所代表的无需许可的理想那样。
    (我们称之为“理想”，因为，正如我们将在下一章中讨论的，比特币软件程序的某些方面也存在促使不受欢迎的所有权集中的担忧——开发人员正在努力克服的缺陷。)
- en: 'Permissioned systems integrate a trusted third party—the very kind of intermediary
    that Satoshi Nakamoto aimed to avoid—to authorize which computers can participate
    in the validation process. This option makes sense for various industries that
    are looking to adopt blockchain technology but whose current industry structures
    just don’t allow a permissionless system. Until the law changes, banks would face
    insurmountable legal and regulatory opposition, for example, to using a system
    like Bitcoin that relies on an algorithm randomly assigning responsibility at
    different stages of the bookkeeping process to different, unidentifiable computers
    around the world. But that doesn’t mean that other companies don’t have a clear
    interest in reviewing how these permissioned networks are set up. Would a distributed
    ledger system that’s controlled by a consortium of the world’s biggest banking
    institutions be incentivized to act in the interests of the general public it
    serves? One can imagine the dangers of a “too-big-to-fail blockchain”: massive
    institutions could once again hold us hostage to bailouts because of failures
    in the combined accounting system. Perhaps that could be prevented with strict
    regulation; perhaps there needs to be public oversight of such systems. Either
    way, it’s incumbent upon us to ensure that the control over the blockchains of
    the future is sufficiently representative of broad-based interests and needs so
    that they don’t just become vehicles for collusion and oligopolistic power by
    the old guard of finance.'

  zh: 权限系统整合了一个可信的第三方——正是中本聪力图避免的那种中介——来授权哪些计算机可以参与验证过程。这种选择对于各种希望采用区块链技术但其当前行业结构不允许无许可系统的行业是有意义的。直到法律发生变化，例如，银行将面临不可逾越的法律和监管反对，因为比特币这样的系统依赖于在不同阶段将责任随机分配给全球不可识别的计算机的算法。但这并不意味着其他公司没有明确的兴趣审查这些受许可网络的设置方式。一个由世界上最大的银行机构财团控制的分布式分类账系统是否会被激励为符合其服务对象——公众的利益行事？人们可以想象“太大而无法失败的区块链”的危险：庞大的机构可能再次因综合会计系统中的失误而将我们拖入纾困，让我们成为救助的人质。也许这可以通过严格的监管来防止；也许需要对这种系统进行公共监督。无论哪种方式，我们有责任确保未来区块链的控制足够代表广泛的利益和需求，以免它们仅仅成为金融旧势力的勾结和寡头权力的工具。
- en: The open-source development of permissioned ledger models that’s being done
    by R3 CEV, a consortium dominated by major banks, and by the Hyperledger group,
    in which tech firms like IBM, Intel, and Cisco play hefty roles, is important.
    It’s forcing the incumbents within them to see the spotlight that this new technology
    shines on the inefficiencies of their old, centralized work processes. And some
    of the ideas being developed there will no doubt be of great value to the wider
    ecosystem of blockchain development. But we believe the “permissionless” ideal
    first laid down by Bitcoin and since followed by countless alternative “altcoins”
    and blockchains is a vital one for the world to focus on.

  zh: 由主要银行主导的财团 R3 CEV 和由 IBM、Intel 和 Cisco 等科技公司主导的 Hyperledger 团体所进行的许可分类账模型的开源开发是重要的。这迫使其中的传统公司看到了这种新技术对他们旧的、集中式工作流程的低效率所带来的关注。在这些地方正在开发的一些想法毫无疑问将对更广泛的区块链开发生态系统产生巨大价值。但我们相信，首先由比特币奠定基础并且后来被无数替代“山寨币”和区块链所遵循的“无需许可”的理想对世界来说至关重要。
- en: 'As we stated in The Age of Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was merely the first crack
    at using a distributed computing and decentralized ledger-keeping system to resolve
    the age-old problem of trust and achieve this open, low-cost architecture for
    intermediary-free global transactions. It may or may not be the platform that
    wins out. Perhaps something else will come along and fulfill for the age of cryptocurrency
    what the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, pair of protocols
    did for the age of the Internet. Something will emerge as a standard, base-layer
    protocol that dictates how all computers everywhere exchange value with each other.
    Will it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, or something else entirely, perhaps a protocol that
    allows computers with digital assets on any one of these competing blockchains
    to trade directly with each other without going through a third party? Such is
    the threat and opportunity that open-source development offers: anyone can copy
    and then improve upon your idea. The good news is that boundless energy and innovation
    will go into figuring out how to iterate upon the ideas that currently exist and
    will build a potentially better system. That innovation might find its way back
    into Bitcoin, helping to cement its first-mover advantage. Or it might diffuse
    the value creation power across a wider array of platforms until something more
    popular comes along. In the next chapter we will ask such questions as we survey
    the frenetic pace of invention in the blockchain space.'

  zh: 正如我们在《加密货币时代》中所述，比特币仅仅是第一次尝试使用分布式计算和去中心化账本系统来解决长期存在的信任问题，并实现这种开放、低成本的架构，以实现无中介的全球交易。它可能成为胜出者，也可能不是。或许会有其他东西出现，并在加密货币时代实现像传输控制协议/互联网协议（TCP/IP）这一协议对互联网时代的影响一样的功能。某种标准的基础层协议将出现，指导着全球所有计算机如何彼此交换价值。它会是比特币、以太坊，还是完全不同的东西，或许是一种允许在这些竞争区块链之一上拥有数字资产的计算机直接交易而无需通过第三方的协议？这正是开源开发提供的威胁和机会：任何人都可以复制并改进你的想法。好消息是，无限的能量和创新将投入到如何迭代当前存在的想法以及可能构建一个更好系统的探索中。这种创新可能会回流到比特币中，有助于巩固其先发优势。或者，它可能会将价值创造能力扩散到更广泛的平台，直到出现更受欢迎的东西。在下一章中，我们将提出这样的问题，同时调查区块链空间中的疯狂发明步伐。
