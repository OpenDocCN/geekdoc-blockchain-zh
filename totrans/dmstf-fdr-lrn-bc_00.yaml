- en: 'In recent years, countries all-inclusive are more focused to the development
    of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Industrial Internet is an important keystone
    of the Industry 4.0 and a key element to transform old kinetic energy into a new
    era. With the help of latest development of IIoT, a single form of equipment and
    different types of enterprises have been connected by the Industrial Internet,
    which allows the resources of different links to be organically combined. The
    Industrial Internet system architecture consists of four aspects: network connection,
    platform, security system, and identification analysis system. Among them, the
    network is used to realize the connection of people, machines, and things, and
    it is the foundation of Industrial Internet. The security system is responsible
    for providing security protection and guarantee, and the purpose of the platform
    is to open up operational data and Internet data to integrate resources. The identification
    analysis system is an important hub for the realization of Industrial Internet.'

    to the connection of smart devices to the internet to collect data and send it
    to other smart devices. Due to the lack of a built-in security mechanism, IoT
    devices are prone to privacy and security concerns and this problem is sorted
    out with Blockchain technology. The key features of blockchain technology, such
    as immutability, transparency, auditability, and data encryption, eliminate the
    shortcomings of IoT devices. This chapter contains a comprehensive analysis of
    both Blockchain and IoT technologies as well as their integration to overcome
    the shortage of these technologies. Demonstrate the benefits of using blockchain
    and IoT technology to produce BIoT (Blockchain-Based IoT). Examine the major issues
    that arise during the seamless integration of blockchain and IoT technology.

    is quickly expanding as a result of their fast growth. Big data management as
    it is now practiced is fragile. When a stored database is tampered with, or when
    untrusted data is gathered, it poses major problems with traditional data management.
    This article focuses on the development of blockchain technology for safe educational
    big data to address these issues (EBD). The blockchain approaches partition the
    data blocks into safe data blocks using cryptography algorithms. The encrypted
    data blocks are linked together in a chain. This guarantees both security and
    flexibility. As a result, the suggested technique in this study uses blockchain
    technology and assures its efficacy through its decentralized and adaptable approach.

    computing that was created with Internet of Things (IoT) users in mind, providing
    computational resources and data management close to their devices. Edge computing
    has decreased bandwidth and latency issues for IoT networks while handling real-time
    applications. Edge computing’s main advantage is that it lowers the communication
    overhead between IoT users and servers. With the widespread use of IoT in our
    daily lives, academics have been drawn to issues such as complexity reduction,
    latency reduction, memory management, and energy consumption reduction. Deep reinforcement
    learning is employed in this work to reduce computational complexity at the IoT
    user end. Q- Learning is used to build the job offloading decision process, which
    reduces the system cost and the curse of high dimensional data. Furthermore, when
    it comes to system expenses, the suggested technique will surpass existing methods.

    moves from remote surveillance to real- time and rapid disease identification.
    Robot assisted surgery is enhancing traditional surgical procedures, particularly
    in long-distance surgeries. Telerobotic surgery provides a variety of products
    and services, including high-quality assistance for people in developing countries
    and military surgical needs. It can also overcome the limitations and inconsistencies
    of public health systems in developing and developed countries and regions. Due
    to the lack of a system for device identification, the major problem in performing
    telerobotic surgery is reliability. A fuzzy control system is utilized to allow
    access to robotic surgery equipment in a constrained environment. Here an adaptive
    robotic system capable of performing constrained tasks while also adapting to
    external influences in a dynamic and unpredictable environment is possible. The
    proposed model uses a fuzzy logic-based selection strategy to detect relevant
    features and provide access rules to surgical equipment.

    and with its various decision-making frameworks. Nowadays even the healthcare
    systems are exploiting the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI), blockchain and AI federated technologies. The multi-criteria decision analysis
    (MCDA) techniques still assist the other technologies while making important decisions.
    Therefore, the present study helps to incorporate articles found in the literature
    based on healthcare systems which are exploiting AI federated learning and multi-criteria
    decision analysis for supporting healthcare systems and for proposing different
    healthcare frameworks. The research study is utilizing MCDA method for assessing
    healthcare general issues along with various strategic angles and perspectives.

- en: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can be referred to as the millions
    of physical devices (such as, instruments, and interconnected sensors and different
    devices). These devices are connected to the internet without requiring any interventions,
    i.e., human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. It is beneficial in low
    deployment cost and wide terrestrial exposure and has found various beneficial
    applications in varied areas, including, environment monitoring, smart city and
    networks, drones, robotics, transportation, smart solutions in healthcare, etc.
    Low-cost computing can enable cloud, big data and SaaS, business analytics, and
    mobile computing technologies, IIoT devices can share and collect data with no
    human intervention. The data collected by IIoT devices can be transmitted to the
    central cloud server for storage. By using data encryption techniques, the security
    and privacy issues can be easily solved. However, IIoT-based systems sometimes
    faces severe security and privacy related issues, particularly during data processing
    and analytic. Federated learning (FL) is referred to as a new computing model
    that trains a machine learning algorithm on multiple local datasets in local mobile
    nodes without explicitly exchanging data samples. The general principle consists
    of training local models on local data samples and exchanging parameters (e.g.,
    the weights and biases of a deep neural network) between these local nodes at
    some frequency to generate a global model shared by all mobile nodes.

    challenges when it needs to meet the mobile IIoT paradigm. Many new paradigms
    are emerging which advocates for the combination of Federated learning with Blockchain
    in order to achieve the true objectives of Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT).
    Federated learning (FL) is a realistic solution to solve the problems of data
    sciences, break data barriers and challenges, and provide best protection in terms
    of high end data security and privacy, especially in the context of the Internet
    of Things (IoT), and big data. The development and evolution of modern information
    and communication technologies is leading us to the fourth industrial revolution,
    in which the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is assumed to be one of the
    key aspects to realize Industry 4.0\. With the increase of both quantity and type
    of IoT devices, a critical mass of data is collected from the real-world environment
    every day. The data need to be processed and analyzed to derive intelligence for
    further use in efficient, secure, and economic ways, and machine learning has
    been adopted in academia and industry to scrutinize and study the data for business
    decision-making. Nevertheless, data hungriness may hinder the development of machine-learning-enabled
    systems, with another growing challenge on protecting data privacy. To address
    the above issue, Google proposed the concept of federated learning in 2016\. As
    an emerging machine learning paradigm, it allows clients at edge to perform model
    training locally and only send model parameter updates to a central server for
    the aggregation of the global model. All raw data are kept in respective local
    storage and not transferred to other clients.

    of societies around the world. We are now in the midst of the fourth industrial
    revolution – Industry 4.0 – and one of the biggest drivers has been the Industrial
    Internet of Things (IIoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The IIoT and WSN
    is the result of widespread use of computers and the interconnectedness of machines
    and connected electronic devices. It has made software a crucial tool for almost
    every industry, from bakeries and arts to manufacturing facilities and banking
    systems. Computers can be mobile or geographically separated over large a distance,
    which exposes them to network disturbances, Quality of Service (QoS) degradation,
    and security vulnerabilities. The IIoT is a complex network at a large scale and
    there is a dire need for network architecture and protocol design that will accommodate
    these diverse domains and competencies and handle the increasing levels of complexity.

    the environment for reduction of energy requirement, is a key factor for energy
    constrained IIoT devices. However, the WSN paradigms were not originally developed
    for this kind of IoT environment. Both technologies are computationally expensive
    and can introduce high bandwidth overhead and delays. These demanding performance
    and power requirements are not suitable for most IIoT devices. This problem has
    been solved by emerging computing paradigms like wireless sensor networks have
    been introduced to offload computation-intensive tasks from lowpower IIoT devices,
    many deep learning models still require to be executed in IIoT devices due to
    security and privacy concerns (i.e., keep data locally). Therefore, there are
    exemplary challenges and issues which are yet to be addressed by researchers in
    order to achieve sustainable computing solutions by the mean of different architectures,
    protocols, methods and technologies in IIoT and wireless networks i.e. edge computing,
    federated learning, deep learning, privacy/security, spectrum sensing, blockchain
