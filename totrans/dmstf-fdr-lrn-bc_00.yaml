    of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Industrial Internet is an important keystone
    of the Industry 4.0 and a key element to transform old kinetic energy into a new
    era. With the help of latest development of IIoT, a single form of equipment and
    different types of enterprises have been connected by the Industrial Internet,
    which allows the resources of different links to be organically combined. The
    Industrial Internet system architecture consists of four aspects: network connection,
    platform, security system, and identification analysis system. Among them, the
    network is used to realize the connection of people, machines, and things, and
    it is the foundation of Industrial Internet. The security system is responsible
    for providing security protection and guarantee, and the purpose of the platform
    is to open up operational data and Internet data to integrate resources. The identification
    analysis system is an important hub for the realization of Industrial Internet.'

    shortcomings of IoT devices. This chapter contains a comprehensive analysis of
    both Blockchain and IoT technologies as well as their integration to overcome
    the shortage of these technologies. Demonstrate the benefits of using blockchain
    and IoT technology to produce BIoT (Blockchain-Based IoT). Examine the major issues

    is quickly expanding as a result of their fast growth. Big data management as
    it is now practiced is fragile. When a stored database is tampered with, or when
    untrusted data is gathered, it poses major problems with traditional data management.
    This article focuses on the development of blockchain technology for safe educational
    big data to address these issues (EBD). The blockchain approaches partition the
    data blocks into safe data blocks using cryptography algorithms. The encrypted
    data blocks are linked together in a chain. This guarantees both security and

    technology and assures its efficacy through its decentralized and adaptable approach.

    i.e., human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. It is beneficial in low
    deployment cost and wide terrestrial exposure and has found various beneficial
    applications in varied areas, including, environment monitoring, smart city and
    networks, drones, robotics, transportation, smart solutions in healthcare, etc.
    Low-cost computing can enable cloud, big data and SaaS, business analytics, and
    mobile computing technologies, IIoT devices can share and collect data with no
    human intervention. The data collected by IIoT devices can be transmitted to the
    central cloud server for storage. By using data encryption techniques, the security
    and privacy issues can be easily solved. However, IIoT-based systems sometimes
    faces severe security and privacy related issues, particularly during data processing
    and analytic. Federated learning (FL) is referred to as a new computing model
    that trains a machine learning algorithm on multiple local datasets in local mobile
    nodes without explicitly exchanging data samples. The general principle consists
    of training local models on local data samples and exchanging parameters (e.g.,
    the weights and biases of a deep neural network) between these local nodes at

  zh: 联邦学习使得能够将数据隐私所启用的安全机制应用于工业物联网（IIoT）。许多学者和专家在这个领域做出了巨大的工作，许多研究人员也在这个研究领域活跃。这一主题也在工业4.0的背景下提出了影响。然而，这个主题相当新颖，到目前为止还没有在其不同配置下进行过研究。从理论和实证角度来看，文献方面存在不足。因此，本书致力于提供前沿技术和新颖研究，这些技术和研究可以实现并提升联邦学习在推进工业物联网方面的有效性和优势。
- en: The book has a collection of solicit original research articles and review articles
    highlighting recent advanced security and privacy techniques relevant to the convergence
    of federated learning in IIoT-based systems based in blockchain. We are glad that
    this book also gathers submissions discussing arising new challenges and opportunities
    from traditional federated learning architectures.
