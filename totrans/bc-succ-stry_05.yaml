    the feel of a hip technology company. Yet its sweeping panoramic views of the
    Boston skyline placed it squarely in the middle of the city’s financial district,
    home to some of the world’s largest financial institutions.

    the company. From its startup ambition of being a “blockchain bank” in 2013, Circle
    had quickly attracted venture capital from major financial players like Goldman
    Sachs, and five years later had a valuation of over $3 billion.^([1](ch05.html#ch01fn43))

    As he looked out the window of his office at Circle’s HQ, his gaze fell once again

    system. Both literally and figuratively, they were *so close*.

    new highway had to have on-ramps and off-ramps into the old highway.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Unlike the crude, early browsers, Mosaic was the first graphical browser that
    ran across multiple operating systems. It could render content more fully. It
    gave users the ability to input data. He immediately saw that this open platform—the
    World Wide Web, accessed through the web browser—was a game changer ([Figure 5-1](#the_browser_that_changed_the_worldleft)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and built with Jeremy and several close college friends. They had the belief that
    open standards built on HTTP and HTML would make content distribution, communication,
    and software all open and ubiquitous. This belief in open standards—rather than
    closed proprietary networks—was behind all the products Allaire Corporation would
    go on to create, including ColdFusion, the first internet programming language,
    and HomeSite, the popular HTML development tool that made it easy for anyone to
    create a website.

    his second company, Brightcove.

    Whereas the existing media landscape was dominated by closed, proprietary networks
    (think broadcast and satellite TV), Jeremy believed the future of media would
    be open, permissionless, and built on the public internet. If TV were to become
    democratized, then anyone in the world could be a distributor, and content could
    go directly to consumers on any device.

    and the explosion of online video. Creating and distributing video was still expensive,

    video became cheap and plentiful. How could traditional media companies adapt?

    of online video (open networks) would later be a parallel for Jeremy’s work at
    Circle.

    Since they are software products, they can be constantly upgraded with new features;
    for example, built-in escrow, or the ability to automatically reconcile payments.
    This gives us the potential to completely reimagine traditional financial products—provided
    we have a price-stable currency.^([6](ch05.html#ch01fn49))'

    work like email: unencumbered by distance, borders, and service providers. As
    an example, a Gmail user can email a Yahoo! mail account because the two systems
    are interoperable, working with a shared email protocol. An Alipay user, by contrast,
    can’t pay someone who is using PayPal, because their payment systems aren’t interoperable.
    There’s no shared protocol.'

    blockchain so that it would be interoperable with any application that also adopts
    those standards and would no longer be confined to a user’s choice of digital
    wallet.

    was not the sole issuer: even the creation of USDC was open.'

    companies must be able to issue it. For a currency to thrive, it must become widely

    set of technical and governance standards protecting it (widespread *trust*).
