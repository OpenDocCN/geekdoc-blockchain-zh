    related conversation and potential area of revenue and advisory services that
    financial services professionals may have traditionally overlooked is the importance
    of cybersecurity advisory services in a business environment that is increasingly
    digitized. Cybersecurity policies and training may have, in the past, focused
    on ensuring that the organization had in place sufficient password controls and
    safeguard to protect data against unauthorized access to client information and
    ensuring that anti-virus software was kept up to date. While these are still,
    rather obviously, still important for every organization, they now simply represent
    a good starting point in the conversation rather than the end point in the debate.
    Stated differently, cybersecurity has moved beyond merely an IT or technical concern,
    and is increasingly a concern for the entire organization at large (McLane [2018](#CR8)).
    None of this is news, however; every professional is going to be aware of just
    how important data integrity and cybersecurity it. Let’s connect this trend and
    topic area to the same topics we have been discussing throughout this book; blockchain,
    artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity tools (Fig. [15.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_15_Chapter/467992_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_15_Chapter/467992_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: Blockchain may be a potentially paradigm shifting technology tool and platform
    that can revolutionize almost every aspect of the financial services industry,
    but at the end of the day it is simply a technology tool like any other. With
    that context in the mind, and taking into account that some of the strengths of
    this technology may also become weaknesses given the situation, several areas
    of consideration being to crystallize. First and foremost, which individuals and
    institutions actually have access to the underlying code, which is after all how
    blockchain functions. Despite the other applications and iterations of blockchain
    that have entered the marketplace, at the core of the idea the functionality of
    blockchain is driven by the programming and coding language. Given the reality
    that many organizations will simply not possess the internal expertise to build
    and develop these tools internally, how are the external consultants and advisors
    vetted? For example, if consultants or advisors were brought into consult and
    help develop different engineering processes those plans and processes would be
    safeguarded with both electronic and physical controls; the security processes
    around the IT team working on blockchain development should be any less.

- en: In addition to the controls and policies that are in place to regulate and control
    the access and custody of coding and programming language, there is also the fundamental
    issue that employees need to be trained and developed in order to use these news
    tools, including blockchain. Like any other new tool or device, and in order to
    accrue the benefits of using such a technology tool and system, individuals and
    teams must know both how these tools function and how these tools can be applied
    across the proverbial board (He et al. [2018](#CR6)). Without establishing training
    and development programs for employees, it is reasonable to forecast that tools
    such as blockchain will not only not be realized, but that such tools may actually
    increase inefficiency and errors throughout different processes and procedures.

    institutional compliance, record keeping, and real time monitoring of information,
    but that does not mean that internal controls or insurance policies are less important
    given these developments. In addition to understanding what specific class and
    category of AI is being implemented, or if it is even AI at – versus RPA or other
    automation platforms – there are additional considerations that need be factored
    into the advisory conversation. Technology can only amplify and accelerate the
    current processes and policies that are in place, and will have no impact on the
    underlying processes themselves. Particularly and especially important in a business
    environment and landscape where information and data is increasingly treated and
    classified as a critical organizational asset, the importance of instituting and
    maintaining proper controls over the flow and dissemination of information between
    stakeholders and partner organizations cannot be overstated (Banham [2017](#CR2)).

    often overlooked, is the documentation and testing of said documentation. Documentation
    has been discussed throughout this text previously, but the underlying process
    and importance of documentation was not discussed in as much detail. Specifically,
    and following the documentation and publication of processes under consideration
    for automation, these processes need to be tested, analyzed, and compared. While
    artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, and other automation processes
    and procedures may not represent traditional roles and responsibilities for accounting
    and financial service professionals, they do augment and expand roles and duties
    linked to internal control, information system integrity, and updating these roles
    and processes over time.

    controls, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies also include the burgeoning
    area of cryptocurrencies. It is true that, as of this writing, the market capitalization
    of the cryptocurrency space at large had lost the vast majority of its value,
    as denominated in fiat currencies, institutional interest and investment had continued
    to increase. Be it Fidelity, Coinbase, or other mainstream financial institutions
    investing both people and financial capital into the space, this trend and fund
    flow also creates a potential issue in terms of controls, security, and risk management.
    This, however, is differentiated from other emerging technology areas such as
    blockchain because it has implications for clients as well as the firms themselves.
    In addition to offering a variety of advisory services and advice linked to cryptocurrency
    accounting and reporting, financial services organizations may offer be accepting
    payment or maintain custody over cryptocurrency assets.

    assets and associated personally identifiable information also represents an entire
    new realm of considerations, opportunities, and concerns that may not have otherwise
    be a factor. In terms of maintaining cash balances the processes and controls
    around these assets are well established, grounded in cross industry policies,
    and reporting frameworks. Cryptocurrencies, on top of the underlying technical
    fundamentals that require education, training, and development, also can pose
    a challenge from a control cybersecurity and risk management perspective. Although
    these new technologies do pose challenges, they also present opportunities for
    motivated and proactive CPAs seeking to capitalize on growing client interest
    and adoption (Brazina et al. [2019](#CR3)). Expanding upon this fact below, there
    are several considerations and points that – in addition to providing potential
    service and revenue lines for practitioners – are also fiduciary responsibilities.
    These considerations, pain points, and potential obstacles include, but are not
    limited to the following:'

    and publication, little to no insurance exists in the broader cryptocurrency space,
    maintain control and custody over the private key (indicative or ownership) is
    of paramount importance. Even if that means simply jotting down the private key
    information on a piece of paper (or in some cases, etching it into metal for a
    more permanent solution) and storing it in a safety deposit box, communicating
    the importance of doing so is a responsibility of financial professionals. Although
    there is a bit of irony in storing information and data linked to cryptocurrency
    in a traditional centralized institution such as a bank, that should not prevent
    logical steps from being taken.

    through the rollercoaster that has been its price history during the last few
    years, has dominated both the headlines and the investment conversation into the
    broader cryptocurrency space. That said, and in spite of the weighting (in terms
    of market capitalization) toward bitcoin overall, it is important to note from
    both a financial and cybersecurity perspective that different cryptocurrencies
    and blockchains can function in vastly different ways. These different underlying
    blockchains, and the computer programming that drives that blockchain itself,
    can also result in different levels of exposure and/or risk for client funds and
    information. Doing the due diligence, and ensuring that clients are aware of and
    understand these differences is a new area, but one of emerging importance.

- en: Data management is going to become increasingly important moving forward. This
    book began with a brief discussion about how information and data is going to
    become increasingly important moving forward in a business landscape that is increasingly
    digitized. An additional consideration and idea that is going to have to become
    part of the financial services conversation is a paradox that is increasingly
    relevant and present in the marketplace. Storing information, even that of a digital
    nature, was traditionally quite expensive and required some level of technical
    expertise to operate, maintain, and expand over time. With the development and
    continued refinement of cloud based data platforms, however, storing and maintain
    records and copies of information has become cheaper, faster, and a core component
    of how many individuals and firms operate. This is all well and good, but if this
    information is being stored in a permanent nature, such as on a blockchain, or
    is being mined – no pun intended – by different types of AI or automation protocols,
    does this change with the new data regulations coming down the pipeline. Discussed
    in more detail in the coming pages, merging and juggling the advances and core
    facets of emerging technologies with the importance and necessity of complying
    with regulations is something that is going to have to be addressed.

- en: Another area of service and advisory work that may seem to be contradictory
    in nature are services lines and products affiliated with helping clients deal
    and contend with the issues affiliated with data storage and management. This
    may seem contrary because, with virtually no stop or pause since the implementation
    of Moore’s Law during the 1960s and 1970s, information and data has been decreasing
    in cost, increasing in efficiency, and also increasing with the ease with which
    these tools and services and be used. From a board level, maintain appropriate
    levels of control, custody, and instituting appropriate controls over customer
    and consumer data is an imperative requirement of financial institutions across
    the board, and especially at the executive and board levels of those organiations
    (Morrison and Kumar [2018](#CR9)). Taking a step back from the specific machinations
    affiliated with accounting and finance and instead viewing the this shift from
    a broader perspective, the following conclusions can be analyzed and reported.
    The rise in storage as a core part of business innovation and development has,
    actually, indirectly led to the rise and development of the entire fields of big
    data, business intelligence, data analytics, and ultimately the very automation
    and data oriented tools that this book and much of the current market debate and
    commentary focuses on. The very ease with which data is stored, however, and even
    though it has led indirectly to the rise of entirely new industries, also poses
    a paradox for financial professionals seeking to develop and offer new services.
    Put simply, the intersection of data storage, the analytics that are based off
    of these data sets, and the new services offerings that can be built on top of
    means that an old trend, highlighted by headline hacks and breaches, may actually
    be new again in terms of client demand and expectations (Allodi and Massacci [2017](#CR1)).
    In other words, the very compliance and reporting functions that have been moving
    out of the conversation as technology has moved in may be coming back to the forefront.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remaining in compliance may seem like a throwback that runs against the very
    spirit of both this book and the trends that are driving the profession forward,
    but in actuality this represents a new step in this development. Regulations are
    a fact of life for organizations, and remaining in compliance with them is not
    anything new or particularly exciting, but the interesting part is not connected
    to the regulation itself, but rather how emerging regulations connect to emerging
    technologies (Griggs and Gul [2017](#CR5)). Be it regulation originating overseas
    or in the United States, contending with the regulation themselves as well as
    how regulation will change and alter underlying business models is not something
    that can ignored (Goldin et al. [2018](#CR4)). For example, the very FAANG stocks
    that drive much of the market volatility in the United States are, virtually without
    exception, based on the collection, storage, and analysis of consumer information.
    While clients or every firm may not contend with the scope or scale of issues
    related to the largest information technology organizations, almost every organization
    collects and retains information linked to customers.

    credit card data, addresses, payment history, and even social security numbers
    are collected on a routine basis, many times without consumers even realizing
    this is happening due to how routine these events have become. Simply because
    a transaction or transfer of data has become more routine, however, does not mean
    that it will continue to operate in this manner going forward. In fact, and present
    both in the United States as well as in international markets, the shift and conversation
    toward increased regulation of how data is treated and regulated is continuing
    to dominate the professional landscape and conversation. This debate and conversation,
    in addition to having an influence on how data is treated and stored moving forward,
    will also mean that professionals and practitioners can also play a role in just
    how different types of technology are defined and classified within a business
    context. Specifically, the differentiated versions of AI that have recently entered
    the marketplace also generate potential revenue and service line opportunities
    for forward looking and oriented practitioners.

    In the case of artificial intelligence, and building on previous points that were

    the functionality of these different tools is, clearly, quite important for advisors
    and consultants seeking to offer services, but it is also an important aspect
    to assist with expectation and implication level setting as these technologies
    become more mainstream (Tashea [2018](#CR10)). As exciting and as many opportunities

    and important to remember, is that not every problem that arises over time is
    also going to appropriate to be addressed with the different types of AI, automation,
    or blockchain based technology tools. On top of that, and realizing the fact that
    many of these tools do come ready to be implemented across different types of
    organizations, not every technology tool is going to be useful for each and every
    problem and issue facing an organization. Better yet, and no matter how applicable
    the technology tool may be to address a specific problem or issue, the training,
    education, and communication associated with these technology tools must become
    a part of the professional conversation (Lai [2018](#CR7)).

    in a proactive and forward looking manner are skills that every financial professional
    must be able to asses and leverage moving forward. Especially as technology tools
    become mainstream in both consumer and professional situations, the necessity
    of financial professionals to set expectations, and to rationalize these expectations

    to especially sexy or interesting among large swaths of professionals, but these
    businesses are only going to grow increasingly important as blockchain and other
    emerging technology become integrated into business operations. Hacks, breaches,
    and other types or data security concerns have become increasingly commonplace
    as data sharing and communication has moved from the realm of expensive to plentiful
    in nature. Automation, RPA, and iterations of artificial intelligence continue
    to create situations in which data is both plentiful and share on a nearly continuous
    basis. With this increased sharing of information, however, comes an increasing
    focus on how cybersecurity fits into the business decision making conversation.
    Cybersecurity is a core issue that has been fundamentally altered by the implementation
    of blockchain; since data becomes more widespread and shared between network members
    ensuring that data management and integrity as built into business models and
    practices. Cyber-insurance, alongside the increased importance of cybersecurity,
    is also positioned to play a larger role and occupy a larger percentage of professional’s
    time moving forward. This also means that practitioners and professionals will
    need to understand how cybersecurity and cyber-insurance operate from a technical
    perspective as well as how these becoming mainstream so it does appear reasonable
    to expect this to increase in both value and importance.
