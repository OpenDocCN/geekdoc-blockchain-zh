    of hoary establishment lions rose up on cue to condemn crypto. JPMorgan Chase’s
    Jamie Dimon (“It’s a fraud”), Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and Charlie
    Munger (“It’s rat poison”), and Paul Krugman of Princeton and the New York Times
    (“It’s evil”) were just the kind of “aging white men” whom Marc Andreessen dissed
    as dependably wrong about technology “almost 100 percent of the time.” To our
    contrarian ears, those fusty guys were singing a contrapuntal chorus of affirmation.

    young financial consultant and entrepreneur who describes himself as “whatever
    the opposite of a futurist is.” His declaration that “after years of tireless
    effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use
    for the blockchain—besides currency speculation and illegal transactions” went
    viral. Announcing that the crypto party is over, he said it’s time to pack up
    the toots and touts, bitcoin caps and cups, books and brochures, time to close
    down the CoinSummits, fintech hackathons, initial coin offering jubilees, and
    blockchain revues. With a note of sanctimony, he called us instead to return to
    the laborious creation of real trust and real value in the existing global economy.[¹](notes.html#ch21note-1)

    with bravado to tell us that not only is the pseudonymous founder himself nakedly
    a nincompoop, but similarly bare-brained are all his Byzantine VC generals touting
    “blockchain.” That means you, Tim Draper, and you, Peter Thiel, and you over there,
    Marc Andreessen.

    for the future.” It is not just destructive but “permanently” so, aiming the world
    in a diametrically wrong direction. The better it gets the worse it will be.

    hashes of previous files” may solve the non-problem of establishing an immutable
    database. But who wants that? Immutable? Really? No matter how big the error or
    the fraud, it cannot be reversed?

    hacked of some $150 million, he waded into his code base wielding his personal
    “hard fork” and rescinded the transaction. Do you want set in concrete all the
    flimflam contracts of “terms and conditions” that you sign on the Internet for
    various last-forever digital subscriptions or live-forever priapic pills? Or do
    you prefer to call a “trusted third party,” whether Visa or Amazon, or the Federal
    Trade Commission, or even Preet Bharara, and have mistakes corrected?

    the need for trust, regulation, law enforcement, government, or trusted intermediaries.
    I cannot say that he is wrong in these rather obvious assertions. In a previous
    article, he grandly proposed that after ten years of experiments and ambitious
    claims there are still no viable “use-cases” for cryptocurrencies or blockchains.
    Even Ripple, despite many advertisements of its blockchain and cryptocurrency
    XRP, does not actually use these devices for most of its ongoing currency exchanges,
    wrote Stinchcombe. Ripple prefers to resort to more liquid and simpler, less volatile
    and cumbersome dollars, yen, yuan, and euros.

    EOS to David Sønstebø at IOTA to Leemon Baird at Hashgraph and Mike Hearn at R3—deploy
    trusted third parties, elected “witnesses,” delegated stakeholders, “reputable
    institutions,” corporate consortia, mining pools, righteous regulators, or intervening
    “coordinators” somewhere to make the system work.

    from lawyers writing quasi-English sentences in small print to software engineers
    on GitHub writing unintelligible code in one of scores of exotic languages. Solidity,
    anyone? Ruby-on-Rails? PHP? Haskell? Python? Except to an elite of crypto punk
    coders (you know them, those super-smart guys with pony tails, conspiratorial
    maze-minds, and a dazed belief that the world may well be an alien simulation),
    smart contracts are the ultimate in opacity. To everyone but the coders, “open
    source” is merely a fancy form of extremely secret sauce. Software languages make
    even legal jargon seem transparent by comparison.

    as on Ripple, whose currency is the most widely used in the entire cryptocosm.
    Since its origin in an obscure white paper on an abstruse crypto punk board, this
    entrepreneurial wave is just ten years old. Its products remain buggy and undeveloped.
    But there are thousands of such companies, and their creativity is prodigious.
    Stinchcombe sees all the flaws and limitations of most of the existing solutions,
    but that makes him no more perceptive than their authors. Their work is as innovative
    and creative as the products of the 1990s Internet outbreak of new companies and
    technologies.

    has recently crippled world capitalism with a ten-year global recession. He believes
    in the efficacy of foreign exchange trading, the Dodd-Frank law, central banking,
    gigantic commercial banks guaranteed by government as “systemically important,”
    the Volker rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission, insider-trading laws,
    and the magic of zero interest rates and quantitative easing. He is part of the
    problem.

    improvements. Just imagine, says he, the global complexities solved by a Visa
    card. His answer to people who are frustrated with the existing bureaucracies
    is not to hide behind some Rube Goldberg crypto-variation, but simply to “vote”
    them out. Good idea, Kai!

    but design better regulations. (More regulations for the Net!) If you want more
    responsive services for the poor, don’t offer to put their contested land titles
    on an immutable database; volunteer to do title searches and community development,
    serve at a soup kitchen, or become a lawyer and offer your skills to Legal Aid.
    (More community-action programs and lawsuits!) Central banks, as he assures us,
    are “appointed by elected officials.” If you “the people” really want an unregulated
    banking system, just vote out the incumbent pols. Why not? They’re the ones who
    appoint these imperial currency managers, piling on the transfer payment bloat
    and bribing the voters with impossible promises of never-ending pensions. (If
    you can’t vote them out, then just stir in more fiat money and debt into the $280
    trillion doomsday pot.)

    itself, that smart contracts and global currencies are something entirely new.
    He implies that the disintermediation of trusted third parties is a radical departure
    fostered by a blockchain apocalypse. But every advance for mechanization and industry,
    from the loom to the sewing machine, the linotype, the metal cutter, the telephone
    switch, and the Internet router to the World Wide Web, has required relinquishing
    some measure of human control to machine languages of various kinds. A numerical
    controlled welder is governed by a smart contract. So is an ATM or other vending
    machine. So is a network processor in a top-of-rack switch in a data center.

    as novel and threatening is that they accept the Google era eschaton. They see
    the advance of automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence as occupying
    a limited landscape of human dominance and control that ultimately will be exhausted
    in a robotic universe—Life 3.0\. But Charles Sanders Peirce, Kurt Gödel, Alonzo
    Church, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and Gregory Chaitin disproved this assumption
    on the most fundamental level of mathematical logic itself.

    a universe of human imagination. As Peirce’s triadic logic illuminates, every
    symbol engenders its own infinity of imaginative interpretation. A symbol and
    its object are incoherent without an interpreter (Peirce says “interpretant”).
    Chaitin celebrates this regime as a new mathematics of creativity that opened
    up after Gödel and Turing disproved the Hilbert hypothesis of a complete and consistent
    mathematical universe.

    exhaust the human domain; they can only expand it. Every new mechanism frees the
    human mind for more creative adventures and accomplishments. Expectations of human
    sacrifices to the Moloch of machinery are at odds with nature and truth.

    are new ways to address the evils of the Google Age: porous Internet security,
    unmoored money, regulatory overreach, network concentration, officious delays,
    and diminishing returns of big data. All of these problems derive from the hypertrophy
    of trusted third parties that need to be collapsed into simpler systems controlled
    by individual agents closer to the actual point of service. Some of these third
    parties are financial traders, search engines, social networks, or global retailers
    run by huge agglomerations of Siren Servers. Other examples of overreach are monetary
    systems run by central banks, parliaments, and treasuries wielding money as a
    magic wand rather than employing the measuring stick of gold. All need to be decentralized
    and brought back under the management of the private parties that understand the
    business constraints and the real investment opportunities.'
