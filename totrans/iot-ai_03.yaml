    with a range of electrical and networking components. The electrical grid comprises
    of generating stations, transmission lines and distribution lines. The primary
    task performed in conventional power grid consists of three major parts: generating
    plant for electric power, transmission and distribution of the electric power
    to consumers both industrial and household. Power generation includes generation
    of electricity using renewable sources as well as from non-renewable sources.
    The generated power is sent to substations and from substations, it is then transmitted
    to different customers (Liu et al., [2018](#CR23)). The supply and demand for
    electricity have increased significantly with the traditional grid, and hence
    modernization of grid needs to be prioritized. Energy system continues to deploy
    innovative technologies in the field of generation, transmission and distribution
    to improve the performance and to maintain environmental sustainability in the
    grid. The increasing dependence of electricity in our everyday life and growing
    need for power quality have motivated the industry to develop a better power grid
    (P. Ganguly et al., [2019](#CR12)). Modernizing the grid to make it smart grid
    refers to computerising the traditional power grid by incorporating cutting-edge
    technologies. The advanced technologies in smart grid include advanced sensors
    known as phasor measurement units (PMUs), smart meters, relays and automated feeder
    switches. Smart grid is a grid automation technology that permits consumers to
    participate in the system. The gradual transition from the traditional power grid
    to the reliable smart grid promises to bring out a change in the entire power
    infrastructure and their relationships with all stakeholders involved in the power
    system. However, the introduction of these digital technologies has introduced
    an additional dimension of cyber risk. Cyber resilience is a challenge for the
    entire power sector. Increased proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    and the digitization of the entire power network have paved the way for increased
    cyber-attack surface (Elmrabet et al., [2012](#CR10)). Figure [3.1](#Fig1) represents
    the layers of smart grid.![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png)'

    its enterprise without causing major havoc by any cyber-attack. It is the ability
    to recover from cyber-attacks and to manage the enterprise and to continuously
    function the business effectively (Nazir et al., [2015](#CR26)). Complete eradication
    of cyber-attacks is not practically possible as the hackers will always look for
    ways to infiltrate in the system by identifying the flaws and vulnerabilities
    in any network. However, a system resiliency is analysed by the sustainability
    offered. An attack in any layer of the grid can make the entire power system down
    and might lead to a total blackout. Cyber resilience in the smart grid needs to
    analyse all the security constraints of every layer in a smart grid architecture.
    Achieving resiliency in the smart grid is a challenge as the grid is a complex
    architecture of complex power systems, high-end network components, sophisticated
    database and cloud architecture. Smart grid resilience is the ability to recover
    the functioning of the power grid after a cyber-attack promptly (Hossain et al.,

    grid needs to consider the major security objectives including confidentiality,
    integrity, availability, authenticity, authorization and non-repudiation (Liu
    et al., [2012](#CR22)). The major challenge is to identify all the possible vulnerabilities
    in the smart grid system and to develop a system which will help in recovery from
    attacks promptly (Ghiasi et al., [2020](#CR13)) (Khan et al., [2020](#CR18)).
    Tools need to be designed in every smart grid layer to achieve resiliency at a
    faster pace so that grid self-healing is achieved (Ghiasi et al., [2020](#CR13)).
    Figure [3.2](#Fig2) represents the three main phases of cyber resilience in smart
    grid. Early detection and diagnosis of attacks in the electricity infrastructure
    are needed to achieve cyber resilience. A cyber resilience grid can only be implemented
    on the top of cyber smart grid architecture. Cyber-infrastructure is to be incorporated
    above physical layer infrastructure. Resilience should authenticate the whole
    system including both physical and cyber components in the grid.![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.png)

    risk management and system modelling. The primary phase is the designing of core
    principles to achieve cyber resilience. Design principles need to consider both
    the physical infrastructure security and data security of the grid. Risk management
    should cover all the loopholes associated with the grid (Nazir et al., [2015](#CR26)).
    Risk needs to be monitored and analysed before the solution is implemented. Prioritization
    of risk in real time should be considered while implementing security. Smart grid
    systems are expected to offer resiliency even with the comprehensive architecture
    framework.

    is done for the attacker to have permanent access to the grid network. The attacker
    then erases all the digital footprints and traces so the system will be having
    no information regarding the attack. The target gets to know about the attack
    only after the attack is launched.

- en: Smart homes  are a combination of digital devices in an IoT framework. IoT when
    implemented in smart homes requires trust-based communication with users attached
    to social networks. Social IoT (SIoT) helps smart homes establish a social relationship
    and provides trust-based communication with all the participating entities (Chen
    et al., [2016](#CR6)). Adaptive trust management calculates the trust of all the
    entities involved in communication using the information from the past to calculate
    the current trust of each node (Chen et al., [2016](#CR6)). The IoT Based Humanoid
    Software for Identification and Diagnosis of Covid-19 Suspects was discussed by
    Karmore et al. ([2020](#CR17)). Trust computations are mainly focussed on trust
    composition, trust propagation and trust aggregation (Guo & Chen, [2015](#CR14)).
    Trust-based secure smart home communication can be implemented by incorporating
    these three elements on the top of the MQTT protocol  (Fig. [3.10](#Fig10)).![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig10_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig10_HTML.png)

- en: Secure communication  between each node in SIoT network can be established using
    DTrustInfer algorithm (Meena Kowshalya & Valarmathi, [2018](#CR25)). Smart home
    network can be represented using graph G (V, E) where V represents the vertices
    which can be the appliances or devices in smart homes. E represents the edges
    of the graph. In the DTrustInfer algorithm, each node computes the trustworthiness
    score before communicating with other nodes (Meena Kowshalya & Valarmathi, [2018](#CR25)).
    Here both trust and authentication of each node are verified before transmission.
    Trust-based MQTT protocol calculates the trust and then follows the MQTT protocol
    which provides double-layer security for data transmission. Here we integrate
    machine learning classifier which helps classify the features of the data and
    generate a model for classification of data. Here we use support vector machine
    (SVM) classifier for machine learning classification. SVM classifiers work well  in
    high-dimension data and are memory efficient (Fig. [3.11](#Fig11)).![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig11_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig11_HTML.png)

    overhead of the proposed scheme. It is noticed that the proposed technique implements
    the smallest amount of communication overhead compared with the related techniques
    while transmitting the data.![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig12_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig12_HTML.png)

    total amount of packets which is delivered in the network (Chen et al., [2020](#CR7)).
    The packet delivery ratio will be minimized whenever there is congestion in network
    traffic. Congestion occurs while delivering the packet from the sender to the
    receiver end. If the congestion is occurred, then the packets are always in the
    sending queue, and it is not entered into the active network transmission process.
    The efficient traffic management procedure will always have a higher packet delivery
    ratio high. Figure [3.13](#Fig13) demonstrates that the proposed technique has
    the improved packet delivery ratio compared with the related technique despite
    simulation time.![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig13_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig13_HTML.png)

    optimization of networks (Chen et al., [2020](#CR7)). Efficient optimization is
    needed in algorithm to enhance the flow control in the network. The delay in the
    network is calculated by combining the delay of each intermediate node when transmitting
    the data packets into the destination. The huge amount of delay will lead to the
    network traffic congestion and produces the packet loss. Figure [3.14](#Fig14)
    demonstrates the end-to-end delay of the proposed technique. The results show
    that the end-to-end delay of the proposed system is less compared to other related
    methods.![../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig14_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_3_Chapter/504166_1_En_3_Fig14_HTML.png)

    delivered through the communication channel in a unit time. It is also measured
    as the number of data bits delivered in the home area network within a specific

- en: The traditional grid can be made a smarter and flexible grid by incorporating
    IoT technologies and machine learning algorithms. Machine learning helps IoT with
    real-time insights which help the smart grid be deployed in full potential. Elimination
    of human errors and processing of big data can be made effective using machine
    learning techniques. The real advantage of machine learning is to identify patterns
    in attacks which help in future prediction of attacks in the grid. Aligning machine
    learning with IoT helps in deploying a fault-tolerant system. Here machine learning
    is incorporated in basic MQTT protocol along with trust architecture. Authentication
    of each node is done by calculating the trustworthiness score of each communicating
    node in the home area network. Trust parameters help add an extra layer of security
    to the MQTT. MQTT protocol provides efficient secure communication, and a classification
    model is created using SVM classifier. SVM classifiers can classify attacks which
    help identify attacking entities. The performance analysis shows that the proposed
    protocol works better in terms of communication overhead, packet delivery ratio,
    throughput, end-to-end delay and data transmission speed. Future work can be done
    by implementing deep learning strategy to the architecture to make it robust.
